AB A pintle injector is a movable injector capable of controlling injection area and velocities. Although pintle injectors are not a new concept, they have become more notable due to new applications such as planet landers and low-cost engines. However, there has been little consistent research on pintle injectors because they have many design variations and mechanisms. In particular, simulation studies are required for bipropellant applications. In this study, combustion simulation was conducted using methane and oxygen to determine the effects of injection condition and geometries upon combustion characteristics. Steady and two-dimensional axisymmetric conditions were assumed and a 6-step Jones-Lindstedt mechanism with an eddy-dissipation concept model was used for turbulent kinetic reaction. As a result, the results with wide flame angles showed good combustion performances with a large recirculation under the pintle tip. Under lower mass flow-rate conditions, the combustion performance got worse with lower flame angles. To solve this problem, decreasing the pintle opening distance was very effective and the flame angle recovered. In addition, a specific recirculation zone was observed near the post, suggesting that proper design of the post could increase the combustion performance, while the geometry without a recirculation zone had the poor performance.

AB Purpose -A new concept solution for improving blast survivability of the light tactical military vehicles is proposed and critically assessed using computational engineering methods and tools.
   Design/methodology/approach -The solution is inspired by the principle of operation of the rocket-engine nozzles, in general and the so called "pulse detonation" rocket engines, in particular, and is an extension of the recently introduced so-called "blast chimney" concept (essentially a vertical channel connecting the bottom and the roof and passing through the cabin of a light tactical vehicle). Relative to the blast-chimney concept, the new solution offers benefits since it does not compromise the cabin space or the ability of the vehicle occupants to scout the environment and, is not expected to, degrade the vehicle's structural durability/reliability. The proposed concept utilizes side vent channels attached to the V-shaped vehicle underbody whose geometry is optimized with respect to the attainment of the maximum downward thrust on the vehicle. In the course of the channel design optimization, analytical and computational analyses of supersonic flow (analogous to the one often used in the case of the pulse detonation engine) are employed.
   Findings -The preliminary results obtained reveal the beneficial effects of the side channels in reducing the blast momentum, although the extent of these effects is quite small (2-4 per cent).
   Originality/value -To the authors' knowledge, the present work is the first exploration of the side-vent-channels concept for mitigating the effect of buried-mine explosion on a light tactical vehicle.

AB In an air-launch-to-orbit, a space rocket is launched from a carrier aircraft Air-launch-to-orbit appears as particularly interesting for nano- and microsatellites which are generally launched as secondary loads, that is, placed in the conventional launch vehicle's payload section with a larger primary satellite. In an air-launch-to-orbit, a small satellite can be launched alone as a primary load, away from a carrier aircraft, aboard a smaller rocket vehicle, and in doing so, benefit from more flexible dates and trajectories. One of the most important phases of the mission is the separation between the carrier aircraft and the space rocket. A flight simulator including a large number of factors of uncertainties has been especially developed to study the separation, and a safety criteria has been defined with respect to store collision avoidance. It is used for a sensitivity analysis and an optimization of the possible trajectories. The sensitivity analysis first requires a screening method to select unessential factors that can be held constant. The Morris method is amongst the most popular screening methods. It requires limited calculations, but may result in keeping constant an essential factor which would greatly affect the results of the sensitivity analysis. This paper shows that this risk can be important in spite of recent improvements of the Morris method. It presents an adaptation of this method which divides this risk by a factor of ten on a standard test function. It is based on the maximum of the elementary effects instead of their average. The method focuses the calculations on the factors with a low impact, checking the convergence of this set of factors, and uses two different factor variations instead of one. This adaptation of the Morris method is used to limit the amount of the air-launch-to-orbit simulations and simplify the uncertainty domain for analysis by Sobol's method. The aerodynamic perturbations due to wind, the parameters defining the trajectory, the interactions, and the mass characteristics of the systems are detected as factors with a high impact The parameters of the trajectory are finally optimized with a stochastic gradient method. It shows that the separation is safer with a low speed, a low climb angle, and a high vertical acceleration of the aircraft. A trajectory offering such a separation will be tested with an air-launch-to-orbit demonstrator from the French space agency CNES and the French aerospace laboratory ONERA. (C) 2014 IAA.

AB As a new concept propulsion system, the pulse detonation engine has received extensive concerns from all over the world in the past few years. With oxidizer on board, it operates as a rocket engine which is known as pulse detonation rocket engine. In this study, a rocket model powered by a single-tube pulse detonation rocket engine was fabricated to demonstrate and validate whether or not it could operate stably and reliably independently. The single-tube pulse detonation rocket prototype consisted of a wireless control unit, three tanks for oxidizer, fuel and purge gas, various valves and a detonation tube. With compact design, the pulse detonation rocket prototype had an outer diameter of 260 mm and a length of 2200 mm. Oxygen, liquid aviation kerosene and nitrogen were utilized as oxidizer, fuel and purge gas, respectively. Operation tests were carried out to obtain proper operating conditions for the pulse detonation rocket prototype first, and then sliding test was conducted. It was concluded that the pulse detonation rocket prototype could operate stably and reliably. The generated thrust was estimated and compared with theoretical value.

AB Numerical simulation of unsteady flows around a complete helicopter was conducted, and the effect of rotor downwash on the behavior of free-flight rockets air-launched from the helicopter and their plume was investigated. For this purpose, a three-dimensional inviscid flow solver based on unstructured meshes was developed, and an overset mesh technique was adopted to handle the relative motion of the main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, and traveling rockets. The flow solver was coupled with six-degrees-of-freedom equations of motion to describe the trajectory of the free-flight rockets. To validate the flow solver for simulating the plume flow from the rocket nozzle, calculations were made for a jet flow impinging on flat plates. To demonstrate the accuracy of the flow solver for predicting rotor downwash, a rotor-fuselage aerodynamic interaction flow was calculated, and the results were compared with available experimental data. The trajectory simulation of an external store released from a fixed wing was also performed to validate the present flow solver coupled with the six-degrees-of-freedom equations of motion. Then the present method was applied to the simulation of free-flight rockets air-launched from a complete helicopter configuration. It was found that rotor downwash has nonnegligible effects on the trajectory of the air-launched rockets and their plume development, which may potentially affect the safety and the reliability of other equipments installed on the mother helicopter.

DE Lunar lander; Network
AB Over the last 3 years, a team at JPL has worked to design a new concept for a small, low cost lander applicable to a variety of in-situ lunar exploration activities. This concept, named Lunette, originated as a design which would exploit potential excess capacity of EELV launches by being compatible with the EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA). The original Lunette mission concept would have allowed up to six low cost landers to be delivered to a targeted region of the moon, with landings separated by a few km, allowing establishment of a regional network with a single, shared launch. The original concept faced limits in the extent of regional distribution of landing sites since all six landers were dependent on a single solid rocket braking motor. In the last year the Lunette team has focused on a modification of the original ESPA-based concept to a design that would allow launch of multiple individual landers (each with its own braking stage) on a single launch vehicle, where each lander would be capable of independent targeting and landing. With such an implementation, the entire lunar surface could be accessed for establishment of network nodes that could enable high priority geophysical measurements on a scale not seen since Apollo. The present paper discusses the current state of the design of the Lunette geophysical network lander, as well as describing mission design, science operations, and an innovative design solution allowing the lander to take critical data continuously, even over the lunar night, without the need for radioisotope power systems.

AB This work uses simple two-body orbital dynamics to initially determine the kinematic access for a ballistic vehicle. Primarily this analysis was developed to assess when a rocket body might conjunct with an orbiting satellite platform. A family of access opportunities can be represented as a volume for a specific rocket relative to its launch platform. Alternately, the opportunities can be represented as a geographical footprint relative to aircraft or satellite position that encompasses all possible launcher locations for a specific rocket. A thrusting rocket is treated as a ballistic vehicle that receives all its energy at launch and follows a coasting trajectory. To do so, the rocket's burnout energy is used to find its equivalent initial velocity for a given launcher's altitude. Three kinematic access solutions are then found that account for spherical Earth rotation. One solution finds the maximum range for an ascent-only trajectory while another solution accommodates a descending trajectory. In addition, the ascent engagement for the descending trajectory is used to depict a rapid access scenario. These preliminary solutions are formulated to address ground-, sea-, or air-launched vehicles.

TI High-Performance Rocket Nozzle Concept
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB An innovative technical solution that overcomes the limitation induced by flow separation phenomena and allows increasing the vacuum-specific impulse of a main stage rocket engine is presented. After reviewing the open technical literature on flow separation and advance nozzles design, the newly proposed concept is extensively presented. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analyses and experimental results (cold gas subscale models) demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple device, adaptable to any bell-shaped nozzle and which provides a solution to the flow separation issue, while increasing vacuum-specific impulse performances for booster and main stage engines. Moreover, this new concept gives rise to a wider engine-throttling range, even at low altitude, without incurring flow separation and associated side loads. Experimental data show a potential for favorable behavior even during transient phases, allowing significant reduction on transient side-loads activity. Finally, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics computations have been extended to the hot tiring case (chemically reactive hydrogen/oxygen propellants), both in steady-state and transient conditions. The results show the suitability of the proposed concept for application to real rocket engines.

TI Effect of different flight conditions at the release of a small
   spacecraft from a high performance aircraft
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Air-launched systems; Trajectory optimization
AB In recent years, mainly due to miniaturization of electronics as well as to the improvement of computer performance, small spacecraft have increased their capabilities. More and more frequently specific mission objectives can be achieved with cheap satellites of reduced size. The growing use of small satellites stimulates the development of systems specifically dedicated to orbit injection of small payloads. In this context, one option is represented by air-launched rockets. The use of an air-launched rocket for delivering a small payload into the desired orbit has several advantages. First of all, payload release is much more flexible, because the delivery conditions are directly related to the dynamics of the aircraft and can be viewed as independent of ground facilities. In addition, reduced costs are associated with higher efficiency of an aircraft in the lower layers of the atmosphere with respect to traditional ground-launched rockets. To date, air-launched rockets separate from the ail-craft in a horizontal flight condition. Then they maneuver in order to achieve the correct flight path angle for injecting into a gravity-turn arc of trajectory. Relevant losses are associated to this pitch maneuver; in addition, in this phase the rocket usually needs an aerodynamic control. Hence, the release of a rocket departing with a high flight path angle from the aircraft would avoid these losses and would simplify the control system, because in such a Situation the pitch maneuver becomes unnecessary: This paper is aimed at investigating the dynamic behavior and performance of a payload delivered from a high performance aircraft, which flies with a high flight path angle. In particular, this work is concerned with showing the differences and tradeoffs among different starting conditions of a multistage air-launched rocket related to several flight path angles of the aircraft at release. An optimal system configuration, which allows placing a micro-satellite into a specified low Earth orbit, is proposed. This configuration is selected by optimizing the release condition, the mass distribution among the stages, and the trajectory (through the determination of the optimal control law).

DE Shock wave interaction; Supersonic air-launching rocket; Supersonic
   separation
AB An analysis was made about the flow characteristics and the rocket motion during supersonic separation of a air-launching rocket from the mother plane. The three-dimensional Euler equations were numerically solved to analyze the steady/unsteady flow fields around the rocket. The simulation results clearly demonstrated the effect of shock-expansion wave interaction between the rocket and its mother plane. A comprehensive analysis showed that the presence of properly designed fins can make the pitch-up motion be more stabilized, and design parameters such as fin size and location of the center of gravity of the rocket are essentially important factors for safe separation. Finally, a guideline about the supersonic air-launching rocket design for safe separation is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The flame-speed-enhancement phenomenon of a solid monopropellant (nitrocellulose) using a highly conductive thermal base (graphite sheet) was demonstrated and studied both experimentally and theoretically. A propellant layer ranging from 20 mu m to 170 mu m was deposited on the top of a 20-mu m thick graphite sheet. Self-propagating oscillatory combustion waves were observed, with average flame speed enhancements up to 14 times the bulk value. The ratio of the fuel-to-graphite layer thickness affects not only the average reaction front velocities but also the period and the amplitude of the combustion wave oscillations. To better understand the flame-speed enhancement and the oscillatory nature of the combustion waves, the coupled nitrocellulose-graphite system was modeled using one-dimensional energy conservation equations along with simple one-step chemistry. The period and the amplitude of the oscillatory combustion waves were predicted as a function of the ratio of the fuel-to-graphite thickness (R), the ratio of the graphite-to-fuel thermal diffusivity (a0), and the non-dimensional inverse adiabatic temperature rise (beta). The predicted flame speeds and the characteristics of the oscillations agree well with the experimental data. The new concept of using a highly conductive thermal base such as carbon-based nano-and microstructures to enhance flame
