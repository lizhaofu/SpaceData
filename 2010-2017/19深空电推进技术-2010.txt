AB The method developed to avoid the complexity of solving the multipoint boundary value problem while optimizing interplanetary trajectories of the spacecraft with electric propulsion and a sequence of swing-bys is presented in the paper. This method is based on the use of the preliminary problem solutions for the impulsive trajectories. The preliminary problem analyzed at the first stage of the study is formulated so that the analysis and optimization of a particular flight path is considered as the unconstrained minimum in the space of the selectable parameters. The existing methods can effectively solve this problem and make it possible to identify rational flight paths (the sequence of swing-bys) to receive the initial approximation for the main characteristics of the flight path (dates, values of the hyperbolic excess velocity, etc.). These characteristics can be used to optimize the trajectory of the spacecraft with electric propulsion. The special feature of the work is the introduction of the second (intermediate) stage of the research. At this stage some characteristics of the analyzed flight path (e.g. dates of swing-bys) are fixed and the problem is formulated so that the trajectory of the spacecraft with electric propulsion is optimized on selected sites of the flight path. The end-to-end optimization is carried out at the third (final) stage of the research. The distinctive feature of this stage is the analysis of the full set of optimal conditions for the considered flight path. The analysis of the characteristics of the optimal flight trajectories to Jupiter with Earth, Venus and Mars swing-bys for the spacecraft with electric propulsion are presented. The paper shows that the spacecraft weighing more than 7150 kg can be delivered into the vicinity of Jupiter along the trajectory with two Earth swing-bys by use of the space transportation system based on the "Angara A5" rocket launcher, the chemical upper stage "KVTK" and the electric propulsion system with input electrical power of 100 kW.

AB Cycler trajectories-both ballistic and powered-are reported in the literature in which there are two-vehicle, three-vehicle, and four-vehicle cases. Such trajectories permit the installation of cycler vehicles which provide safe and comfortable living conditions for human space travel between Earth and Mars during every synodic opportunity. The question the present paper answers is a logical, obvious one: Does a single-vehicle, one-synodic-period cycler exist? The answer is yes: such a trajectory can be flown but only with a high-power electric propulsion system. In our example, it is found that "stopover" trajectories that spend 30 days in orbit about Earth and 30 days about Mars, and return astronauts to Earth in one synodic period require a 90-t power generator with a power level of 11 MWe. Fortuitously, and in lieu of using chemical propulsion, the high power level of the electric propulsion system would also be effective in hauling the cargo payload via a spiral trajectory about the Earth. But because one synodic period is not enough for the cycler vehicle to fly both the interplanetary trajectories and the Earth-spiral trajectories, we suggest developing two nuclear power generators, which could alternate flying the interplanetary trajectories and the Earth-spiral trajectories. Once these power generators are launched and begin operating in space, the mass requirement in seven subsequent missions (over a period of 15 years beginning in 2022) would be modest at 250-300 metric tons to low-Earth orbit per mission. Thus two cargo launches of NASA's Space Launch System and one crew launch of the Falcon Heavy, for example, would be adequate to maintain support for each consecutive mission. Although we propose developing two sets of electric propulsion systems to account for the Earth-spiral phases, only one vehicle is flown on a heliocentric trajectory at any given time. Thus, our low-thrust stopover cycler with zero encounter velocities falls into a category of a "one-vehicle cycler," which completes the gap in the literature, where we have already seen multiple-vehicle cycler concepts.

AB Propulsion is required for satellite motion in outer space. The displacement of a satellite in space, orbit transfer and its attitude control are the task of space propulsion, which is carried out by rocket engines. Electric propulsion uses electric energy to energize or accelerate the propellant. The electric propulsion, which uses electrical energy to accelerate propellant in the form of plasma, is known as plasma propulsion. Plasma propulsion utilizes the electric energy to first, ionize the propellant and then, deliver energy to the resulting plasma leading to plasma acceleration. Many types of plasma thrusters have been developed over last 50 years. The variety of these devices can be divided into three main categories dependent on the mechanism of acceleration: (i) electrothermal, (ii) electrostatic and (iii) electromagnetic. Recent trends in space exploration associate with the paradigm shift towards small and efficient satellites, or micro-and nano-satellites. A particular example of microthruster considered in this paper is the micro-cathode arc thruster (mu CAT). The mu CAT is based on vacuum arc discharge. Thrust is produced when the arc discharge erodes some of the cathode at high velocity and is accelerated out the nozzle by a Lorentz force. The thrust amount is controlled by varying the frequency of pulses with demonstrated range to date of 1-50 Hz producing thrust ranging from 1 mu N to 0.05 mN.

AB Propulsion and power have long been core competencies of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC). At the dawn of the space era, the center brought key propulsion and power technology to support spacecraft development. This paper serves as an introduction to a series of papers describing the highlights of the GRC's power and propulsion research and development efforts. The power papers cover solar and nuclear power generation and energy conversion, energy storage (focusing on batteries, flywheels, and fuel cells), power systems, and power management and distribution. The propulsion papers cover chemical propulsion, cryogenic propellant systems, electric propulsion, and nuclear thermal rocket propulsion. Each paper addresses some history, current efforts, and future plans for each of the technology areas. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000315. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

ID HELICON DIFFUSION PLASMAS; DISCHARGE; BREAKDOWN
AB Optimization of radiofrequency (RF) plasma sources for the development of space thrusters differs from other applications such as plasma processing of materials since power efficiency, propellant usage, particle acceleration or heating become driving parameters. The development of two RF (13.56 MHz) plasma sources, the high-pressure (similar to 1 Torr) capacitively coupled 'pocket rocket' plasma micro-thruster and the low-pressure (similar to 1 mTorr) inductively coupled helicon double layer thruster (HDLT), is discussed within the context of mature and emerging electric propulsion devices. The density gradient in low-pressure expanding RF plasmas creates an electric field that accelerates positive ions out of the plasma. Generally, the total potential drop is similar to that of a wall sheath allowing the plasma electrons to neutralize the ion beam. A high-pressure expansion with no applied magnetic field can result in large dissociation rates and/or a collimated beam of ions of small area and a flowing heated neutral beam ('pocket rocket'). A low-pressure expansion dominated by a magnetic field can result in the formation of electric double layers which produce a very directed neutralized beam of ions of large area (HDLT).

TI Optimal Geostationary Orbit Transfers Using Onboard Chemical-Electric

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

ID LOW-THRUST TRANSFERS; SATELLITE; OPTIMIZATION
AB A comprehensive analysis of maximum-payload transfers to geostationary Earth orbit using combined chemical and electric propulsion is presented. The mission sequence begins with injection into an elliptical orbit with an arbitrary apogee altitude, an apogee burn using the onboard chemical stage to raise perigee and/or reduce inclination, and a low-thrust transfer to geostationary orbit. A new optimization method is developed for this transfer problem, and this approach greatly reduces the design space and eliminates numerical integration of the system dynamics and the associated convergence issues. The new technique includes realistic effects such as Earth eclipses and solar-cell degradation due to passage through the radiation belts. Maximum-payload transfers are obtained for six launch options from NASA Kennedy Space Center and the Sea Launch option. All optimal transfers from NASA Kennedy Space Center use essentially the same starting orbit for the electric stage when transfer time is fixed. The payload mass benefit from using electric propulsion divided by transfer time (the so-called net transportation rate) is determined to range from 4.4 kg/day for the smallest launch vehicle (Atlas 501) to 10.5 kg/day for the largest launch vehicle (Atlas 551) considered in this study. A method for approximating payload mass, beginning-of-life array power, and transportation rate is developed, and its prediction error is shown to be less than 5% for all cases.

TI Mars sample return mission architectures utilizing low thrust propulsion
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Mars sample return; Low thrust electric propulsion
AB The Mars sample return mission is a flagship mission within ESA's Aurora program and envisioned to take place in the timeframe of 2020-2025. Previous studies developed a mission architecture consisting of two elements, an orbiter and a lander, each utilizing chemical propulsion and a heavy launcher like Ariane 5 ECA. The lander transports an ascent vehicle to the surface of Mars. The orbiter performs a separate impulsive transfer to Mars, conducts a rendezvous in Mars orbit with the sample container, delivered by the ascent vehicle, and returns the samples back to Earth in a small Earth entry capsule. Because the launch of the heavy orbiter by Ariane 5 ECA makes an Earth swing by mandatory for the trans-Mars injection, its total mission time amounts to about 1460 days. The present study takes a fresh look at the subject and conducts a more general mission and system analysis of the space transportation elements including electric propulsion for the transfer. Therefore, detailed spacecraft models for orbiters, landers and ascent vehicles are developed. Based on that, trajectory calculations and optimizations of interplanetary transfers, Mars entries, descents and landings as well as Mars ascents are carried out. The results of the system analysis identified electric propulsion for the orbiter as most beneficial in terms of launch mass, leading to a reduction of launch vehicle requirements and enabling a launch by a Soyuz-Fregat into GTO. Such a sample return mission could be conducted within 1150-1250 days. Concerning the lander, a separate launch in combination with electric propulsion leads to a significant reduction of launch vehicle requirements, but also requires a large number of engines and correspondingly a large power system. Therefore, a lander performing a separate chemical transfer could possibly be more advantageous. Alternatively, a second possible mission architecture has been developed, requiring only one heavy launch vehicle (e.g., Proton). In that case the lander is transported piggyback by the electrically propelled orbiter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents some validation results for a set of improved, complete, gaskinetic solutions for a rarefied jet expanding into vacuum. A classical rocket plume model with a cosine relation and direct simulation Monte Carlo results are used to validate this set of analytical solutions. For the analytical and direct simulation Monte Carlo results, there is excellent agreement for flows with large Knudsen numbers. To reduce the computation cost, a set of simplified analytical solutions is introduced as well. A cosine-law plume model has improved performance at low Knudsen numbers. However, for more rarefied high-speed rocket plume flows, such as those fired from electric propulsion devices, the newly developed model has relatively better performance. The new analytical solutions further provide velocity, temperature, and pressure results.

AB Dawn's ion propulsion system (IPS) is the most advanced propulsion system ever built for a deep-space mission. Aside from the Mars gravity assist it provides all of the post-launch Delta V required for the mission including the heliocentric transfer to Vesta, orbit capture at Vesta, transfer to various Vesta science orbits, escape from Vesta, the heliocentric transfer to Ceres, orbit capture at Ceres, and transfer to the different Ceres science orbits. The ion propulsion system provides a total Delta V of nearly 11 km/s, comparable to the Delta V provided by the 3-stage launch vehicle, and a total impulse of 1.2x10(7) N s.

AB The nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) propulsion is one of the leading promising technologies for primary space propulsion for manned exploration of the solar system due to its high specific impulse capability and sufficiently high thrust-to-weight ratio. Another benefit of NTR is its possible bimodal design, when nuclear reactor is used for generation of a jet thrust in a high-thrust mode and (with an appropriate power conversion system) as a source of electric power to supply the payload and the electric engines in a low-thrust mode. The model of the NTR thrust control was developed considering high-thrust NTR as a propulsion system of limited power and exhaust velocity. For the proposed model the control of the thrust value is accomplished by the regulation of reactor thermal power and propellant mass flow rate. The problem of joint optimization of the combination of high- and low-thrust arcs and the parameters of bimodal NTR (BNTR) propulsion system is considered for the interplanetary transfers. The interplanetary trajectory of the space vehicle is formed by the high-thrust NTR burns, which define planet-centric maneuvers and by the low-thrust heliocentric arcs where the nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) is used. The high-thrust arcs are analyzed using finite-thrust approach. The motion of the corresponding dynamical system is realized in three phase spaces concerning the departure planet-centric maneuver by means of high-thrust NTR propulsion, the low-thrust NEP heliocentric maneuver and the approach high-thrust NTR planet-centric maneuver. The phase coordinates are related at the time instants of the change of the phase spaces due to the relations between the space vehicle masses. The optimal control analysis is performed using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The numerical results are analyzed for Earth-Mars "sprint" transfer. The optimal values of the parameters that define the masses of NTR and NEP subsystems have been evaluated. It is shown that the low-thrust NEP subsystem with Brayton cycle power conversion system is preferable in comparison with NEP subsystem with thermoemission power conversion system.

AB The disparate design problems of selecting an electric propulsion system, launch vehicle, and flight time all have significant impacts on the cost and robustness of a mission. The effects of these system choices combine into a single optimization of the total mission cost, where the design constraint is a required spacecraft net (nonelectric propulsion) mass. Cost-optimal systems are designed for a range of mass margins to examine how the optimal design varies with mass growth. The resulting cost-optimal designs are compared with results generated via mass optimization methods. Additional optimizations with continuous system parameters address the impact on mission cost due to discrete sets of launch vehicle, power, and specific impulse. The examined mission set comprises a near-Earth asteroid sample return, a multiple main belt asteroid rendezvous, a comet rendezvous, a comet sample return, and a mission to Saturn.

   Propulsion with Interferometry
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the experimental characterization of single-pass ion cyclotron resonance heating as applied to acceleration of ions for electric propulsion. A millimeter-wave interferometer system has shown to be a clear and simple method of quantifying ion acceleration due to ion cyclotron resonance heating. The experimental work was done on the VX-10 experiment of the variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket concept. The perpendicular velocity of the ions generated by ion cyclotron resonance heating was converted into axial velocity by the decreasing gradient of the axial magnetic field at the exhaust of the propulsion system from conservation of the magnet moment. This increase in axial velocity is predicted to cause a decrease in density due to conservation of current in the plasma. Interferometer density measurements were taken at three different locations on the VX-10 experiment upstream and downstream of the ion acceleration zone. A clear measurement of a 25% density drop for helium and a 40% density drop for deuterium was measured downstream of the ion resonance zone characteristic of ion acceleration.

ID SPACE EXPLORATION; COSMIC-RADIATION; CANCER
AB Exposure to cosmic radiation is today acknowledged as a major obstacle to human missions to Mars. In fact, in addition to the poor knowledge on the late effects of heavy ions in the cosmic rays, simple countermeasures are apparently not available. Shielding is indeed very problematic in space, because of mass problems and the high-energy of the cosmic rays, and radio-protective drugs or dietary supplements are not effective. However, the simplest countermeasure for reducing radiation risk is to shorten the duration time, particularly the transit time to Mars, where the dose rate is higher than on the planet surface. Here we show that using nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) rockets, the transit time could be substantially reduced to a point where radiation risk could be considered acceptable even with the current uncertainty on late effects.

AB The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is one of the high performance electric propulsion devices for future interplanetary applications. Helicon sources can produce high-density plasmas with high-ionization efficiency suitable for VASIMR, which usually use two electromagnets to produce the required magnetic field configuration. How to optimal design the solenoids and how to create the requisite B-field are the key factors to affect the characteristics and performance of the helicon plasma. In this paper, the magnets were designed and fabricated, and an experimental helicon source was presented. Two solenoids situated around the cylindrical quartz tube were used to create an expanding magnetic field of about 250 G in the center decreasing to a few tens of Gauss in the downstream diffusion region. The antenna was powered by a radio-frequency (RF) system of 13.56 MHz, which maximum changeable power is 500 W. Our helicon device was installed with vacuum chamber that is pumped down to a base pressure of about 0.001 Pa using cryopumps. Langmuir probe is mounted on to measure the plasma parameters. It is found that, when increasing the radio-frequency power or varying the magnetic field, both the plasma density and operating mode of helicon-wave ion are also changed. Permanent magnets (PM) and High temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets are also considered to use in the helicon source, and relative analyses are discussed. The details of further research are to investigate the relationship that the applied magnets affect on the efficiency and performance of the helicon plasma.

AB Dawn launched on 27 September 2007 on a mission to orbit main belt asteroids (4) Vesta in 2011-2012 and (1) Ceres in 2015. The operations team conducted an extensive set of assessments of the engineering subsystems and science instruments during the First 80 days of the mission. A major objective of this period was to thrust for one week with the ion propulsion system to verify flight and ground systems readiness for typical interplanetary operations. Upon successful conclusion of the checkout phase, the interplanetary cruise phase began, most of which will be devoted to thrusting. The flexibility afforded by the use of ion propulsion enabled the project to accommodate a launch postponement of more than three months caused by a combination of launch vehicle and tracking system readiness, unfavorable weather, and then conflicts with other launches. Even with the shift in the launch date, all of the science objectives are retained with the same schedule and greater technical margins. This paper describes the conclusion of the development phase of the project, launch operations, and the progress of mission operations through the conclusion of deterministic thrusting in October 2008.

TI Trajectory options for the DART mission
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This study presents interplanetary trajectory options for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft to reach the near Earth object, Didymos binary system, during its 2022 Earth conjunction. DART represents a component of a joint NASA-ESA mission to study near Earth object kinetic impact deflection. The DART trajectory must satisfy mission objectives for arrival timing, geometry, and lighting while minimizing launch vehicle and spacecraft propellant requirements. Chemical propulsion trajectories are feasible from two candidate launch windows in late 2020 and 2021. The 2020 trajectories are highly perturbed by Earth's orbit, requiring post-launch deep space maneuvers to retarget the Didymos system. Within these windows, opportunities exist for flybys of additional near Earth objects: Orpheus in 2021 or 2007 YJ in 2022. A second impact attempt, in the event that the first impact is unsuccessful, can be added at the expense of a shorter launch window and increased (similar to 3x) spacecraft Delta V. However, the second impact arrival geometry has poor lighting, high Earth ranges, and would require additional degrees of freedom for solar panel and/or antenna gimbals. A low-thrust spacecraft configuration increases the trajectory flexibility. A solar electric propulsion spacecraft could be affordably launched as a secondary spacecraft in an Earth orbit and spiral out to target the requisite interplanetary departure condition. A sample solar electric trajectory was constructed from an Earth geostationary transfer using a representative 1.5 kW thruster. The trajectory requires 9 months to depart Earth's sphere of influence, after which its interplanetary-trajectory includes a flyby of Orpheus and a second Didymos impact attempt The solar electric spacecraft implementation would impose additional bus design constraints, including large solar arrays that could pose challenges for terminal guidance. On the basis of this study, there are many feasible options for DART to meet its mission design objectives and enable this unique kinetic impact experiment. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This contribution presents a short review of electric propulsion (EP) technologies for satellites and spacecraft. Electric thrusters, also termed ion or plasma thrusters, deliver a low thrust level compared to their chemical counterparts, but they offer significant advantages for in-space propulsion as energy is uncoupled to the propellant, therefore allowing for large energy densities. Although the development of EP goes back to the 1960s, the technology potential has just begun to be fully exploited because of the increase in the available power aboard spacecraft, as demonstrated by the very recent appearance of all-electric communication satellites. This article first describes the fundamentals of EP: momentum conservation and the ideal rocket equation, specific impulse and thrust, figures of merit and a comparison with chemical propulsion. Subsequently, the influence of the power source type and characteristics on the mission profile is discussed. Plasma thrusters are classically grouped into three categories according to the thrust generation process: electrothermal, electrostatic and electromagnetic devices. The three groups, along with the associated plasma discharge and energy transfer mechanisms, are presented via a discussion of long-standing technologies like arcjet thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters and ion engines, as well as Hall thrusters and variants. More advanced concepts and new approaches for performance improvement are discussed afterwards: magnetic shielding and wall-less configurations, negative ion thrusters and plasma acceleration with a magnetic nozzle. Finally, various alternative propellant options are analyzed and possible research paths for the near future are examined.
