AB This paper explores the possibility of passively controlling the reactivity of a nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) reactor. The objective of this study is to limit the use of the radial control drums to start-up and shutdown procedures and ensure that the exact same operation is performed for each full-power burn. To achieve the goal, this work considers several design measures, which include a low-density burnable absorber in the tie-tube components of the core, the use of variable hydrogen density in the moderator element coolant passages, and the judicious selection of a modified mission profile to maximize the decay of 135Xe after operation. In addition, the improved stability from the enhanced fuel temperature feedback due to the implementation of low-enriched-uranium fuel is also exploited for the realization of passive reactivity control. In this work, a passive reactivity control system is implemented in the Superb Use of Low Enriched Uranium (SULEU) NTP core and analyzed in terms of its ability to fulfill a NASA Mars Mission Design Reference Architecture 5.0-style mission. It is concluded that the use of the control drums can be limited to start-up and shutdown operations only, eliminating operator input in order to maintain a constant power level in the core.

AB The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been actively involved in nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) technology development, mission, engine, and vehicle design dating back to the Rover and Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications programs. This technology was successfully developed in over 20 rocket/reactor tests, which demonstrated a wide range of thrust levels, high-temperature fuel, sustained engine operation, accumulated time at full power, and restart capability-everything required for a human mission to Mars. Furthermore, NTP requires no large technology scale-up. The smallest engine tested during the Rover program-the Pewee Engine-is sufficient for this when used in a clustered engine arrangement. The GRC has led every major study involving NTP since the late 1980s and has helped quantify the evolution and growth potential of the nuclear thermal rocket (NTR), which includes the bimodal and liquid-oxygen- (LOX-) augmented NTR concepts. In NASA's recent Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) study, NTP reduced total mission mass over 400 t compared with chemical propulsion. Human missions to the Moon and near-Earth asteroids are also enhanced using NTP. In 2011, NASA restarted an NTP technology demonstration effort that is continuing under the Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage project, which began in 2012. Ground demonstrations of a small, scalable NTR by 2020 are envisioned, with a flight demonstration shortly thereafter. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000313.
