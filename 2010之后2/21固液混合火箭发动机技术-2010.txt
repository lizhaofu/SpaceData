AB The practical implementation of hybrid rocket motors has historically been hampered by the slow regression rate of the solid fuel. In recent years, the research on advanced injector designs has achieved notable results in the enhancement of the regression rate and combustion efficiency of hybrid rockets. Following this path, this work studies a new configuration called double-tube characterized by injecting the gaseous oxidizer through a head end injector and an inner tube with injector holes distributed along the motor longitudinal axis. This design has demonstrated a significant potential for improving the performance of hybrid rockets by means of a better mixing of the species achieved through a customized injection of the oxidizer. Indeed, the CFD analysis of the double-tube configuration has revealed that this design may increase the regression rate over 50% with respect to the same motor with a conventional axial showerhead injector. However, in order to fully exploit the advantages of the double-tube concept, it is necessary to acquire a deeper understanding of the influence of the different design parameters in the overall performance. In this way, a parametric study is carried out taking into account the variation of the oxidizer mass flux rate, the ratio of oxidizer mass flow rate injected through the inner tube to the total oxidizer mass flow rate, and injection angle. The data for the analysis have been gathered from a large series of three-dimensional numerical simulations that considered the changes in the design parameters. The propellant combination adopted consists of gaseous oxygen as oxidizer and high-density polyethylene as solid fuel. Furthermore, the numerical model comprises Navier-Stokes equations, k-epsilon turbulence model, eddy-dissipation combustion model and solid-fuel pyrolysis, which is computed through user-defined functions. This numerical model was previously validated by analyzing the computational and experimental results obtained for conventional hybrid rocket designs. In addition, a performance analysis is conducted in order to evaluate the influence in the performance provoked by the possible growth of the diameter of the inner fuel grain holes during the motor operation. The latter phenomenon is known as burn through holes. Finally, after a statistical analysis of the data, a regression rate expression as a function of the design parameters is obtained.

AB Liquid or gaseous fuel scramjet technology has made great progress, and there has been some research attention to solid-fuel scramjet. A new scramjet configuration using solid fuel as propellant, namely solid-fuel rocket scramjet, is tested experimentally. It consists of two combustors. One is a rocket combustor used as gas generator, and the other is a supersonic combustor used for secondary combustion. The experiment simulates a flight Mach number of 4 at high altitude (stagnation temperature and pressure are 1170 K and 1.16 MPa, respectively), and metalized solid fuel is used as propellant. The results reveal that fuel-rich gas from the gas generator can burn with air in the supersonic combustor. Preliminary evaluation results show that the combustion efficiency of the propellant is about 90%, and the total pressure recovery coefficient in the supersonic combustor is about 0.6. These results indicate that the configuration of solid-fuel rocket scramjet is feasible.

AB The Large-Eddy Simulation of a reduced-scale rocket engine operated by DLR has been conducted. This configuration features 42 coaxial injectors fed with liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen. For a given set of injection conditions the combustor exhibits strong transverse thermo-acoustic oscillations that are retrieved by the numerical simulation. The spatial structure of the two main modes observed in the LES is investigated through 3D Fourier analysis during the limit cycle. They are respectively associated with the first transverse and first radial resonant acoustic modes of the combustion chamber. The contributions of each individual flame to the unsteady heat release rate and the Rayleigh index are reconstructed for each mode. These contributions are in both cases low in the vicinity of velocity anti-nodes and high near pressure anti-nodes. Moreover it is noticed that these pressure fluctuations lead to large velocity oscillations in the hydrogen stream. From these observations, a driving mechanism for the flame response is proposed and values for the gain and phase of the associated flame transfer function are evaluated from the LES.

ID INSTABILITY
AB A series of tests are conducted to understand the basic features of the coupling mechanism of combustion pressure with the local heat release fluctuation upon the occurrence of low-frequency instability in a hybrid rocket engine. In stable combustion, combustion pressure fluctuates at the frequency of about 20 Hz because of the thermal lag of solid fuel burning. Also, there exist steady spatial distributions of heat release, which are similar to a shear-layer structure. However, when low-frequency instability occurs, the combustion pressure is amplified, and the luminosity starts to fluctuate at a frequency of about 20 Hz. More interestingly, a positive coupling is observed between two fluctuations. The CH* radical luminosity images and proper orthogonal decomposition analysis show the lumped flow structures with time-varying intensity in unstable combustion. A periodic change in the local heat release appears to generate large-scale flow rotations, and the large-scale flow rotations are likely to be associated with the periodic flame extinction at a frequency of about 20 Hz. Also, the flame extinction seems to take a crucial role in the occurrence of low-frequency instability, although it is not clearly understood why the flame extinction occurs in the specific geometric configuration.

ID INDUCER
AB Inducers are critical to the minimization of the degradation of liquid oxygen pumps and the maximization of the thrust-to-weight ratio of liquid rocket engines, but create cavitation instabilities that have adverse effects on their reliabilities. To examine the cavitation instabilities that arose during the development testing of a liquid oxygen pump that uses water and liquid oxygen as its working media, accelerometers were employed instead of pressure transducers, which are complicated to install. The supersynchronous rotating cavitation and asymmetric cavitation of the pump were characterized by analyzing the signals from the accelerometers, and these results were found to be in good agreement with those of previous studies. Supersynchronous rotating cavitation was found to occur in the tests of both propellants, whereas asymmetric cavitation was found to be dominant in the liquid oxygen test.

AB This paper describes the development of a novel multi-target multispectral pyrometer to remotely measure the true temperature of the plume of a solid fuel rocket engine in a harsh environment ground test. Using an optical fiber transmission technique, the core part of the instrument can be located 100 m away from the test site, so the influence of the harsh environment can be reduced and the instrument reliability improved. Optics are separated from prisms to accurately locate targets. Based on preamplifier circuits and parallelly adjacent pixels of the photodiode detectors, the measurement lower limit can reach 900 degrees C. The pyrometer is validated against experimental data from field measurements of a solid fuel rocket motor plume. The results demonstrate that the true temperature of the solid fuel rocket engine plume can be acceptably measured with the proposed pyrometer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Information visualization has been performed for researching a single-stage sounding launch vehicle with hybrid rocket engine by using design informatics. The primary objective of this study is to reveal extinction-reignition superiority, which is one of the beneficial points of hybrid rocket, for extending the downrange and the duration in the lower thermosphere. In our hybrid rocket, swirling-flow oxidizer is furnished with solid fuel; we adopt polypropylene for solid fuel and liquid oxygen for oxidizer. A multidisciplinary design optimization is implemented by using a hybrid evolutionary computation; data mining is carried out by using a scatter plot matrix to efficiently perceive the entire design space. It is consequently revealed that extinction-reignition prolongs duration although it does not provide any effects on spreading downrange. Scatter plot matrix results indicate physical mechanisms of design variable behaviors for the objective functions and also the roles of the design variables via bird's-eye visualization of the entire design-space constitution. Furthermore, they suggest a hypothesis to extend downrange. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The classic hybrid rocket which employs hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel is characterized by low ablation rate. To enhance the ablation rate, paraffin was added to the HTPB. The enhancement is due to the low viscosity and low surface tension of the surface melt layer of the paraffin during combustion. This paper reports the thermal properties, mechanical properties and ablation rate when HTPB was blended with different percentage of paraffin. The thermal stability of the blends was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry analysis with constant heating rate 27Kmin(-1) under argon atmosphere. The thermal stability of the blends decreased with the increase in paraffin content. The constant pressure specific heat capacities ( of the fuel blends were measured using DSC in the temperature range of 80-250C. The theoretical model of the ablation rate of HTPB-paraffin blends using activation energy, pre-exponential factor and was studied. The results indicated a higher regression rate of 6-33% with the increase in paraffin. The combustion enthalpy of HTPB blended with paraffin is determined by oxygen bomb calorimeter at a constant volume. The standard combustion enthalpy of pure HTPB and paraffin was found to be 37.9 and 41.9MJkg(-1). The data revealed that blending of HTPB with paraffin, resulted an increase in the heat of combustion by 2-9%. The blending of the paraffin will reduce the mechanical strength. Studies were also carried out to find out the dynamic mechanical properties as the result of blending paraffin to HTPB using dynamic mechanical analysis. The temperature was held constant at room temperature and the frequency scan ranged from 1 to 10Hz in steps of 1Hz. The results show that the presence of paraffin in HTPB binder has considerable effect on the dynamic response of the material.

   cryogenic tank during discharge

AB Reducing pressurant gas requirement is of importance to the design of pressurization systems. In the present paper, a two-side-insulated tank, in which both of interior and outside surfaces of the tank wall are covered by insulation layers, is proposed, and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach is introduced to investigate its thermal behaviors and pressurization performance. The pressurant gas requirement, temperature distributions, and energy distributions within the tank system are obtained and analyzed. The results show that the inner insulation layer can remarkably reduce the gas requirement during the liquid discharge period. For the event of pressuring a liquid oxygen (LO2) tank with 300 K helium gas, a decrease in gas requirement of 16% could be reached by using a 3-mm-thickness foam layer at the tank interior surface. For the event of pressuring a liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank with 300 K hydrogen gas, the same thickness foam layer produces a decrease of 14.2% in gas requirement. Moreover, the effect of inner insulation layer in reducing gas requirement is more significant with the increase of inlet gas temperature. When 600 K helium gas is used to pressure the LO2 tank, a decrease of 23.2% in gas requirement is reached by only a 1-mm-thickness foam layer in comparison with the tank without inner layer. The effect of inner insulation layer in reducing gas requirement is mainly because the energy distribution, occupied by ullage, wall, inner insulation layer and liquid propellant, is changed. Since the character of low thermal conductivity for the insulation material, there is a significant temperature drop within the insulation layer by which the heat transfer from ullage to insulation layer is reduced apparently, resulting in more energy left in ullage to provide pressurization effect. However, the gas-to-liquid heat transfer is also enhanced due to the warmer ullage caused by the introduction of inner insulation layer, which suppresses the energy proportion rise in the ullage region. In general, the introduction of inner insulation layer can distinctly reduce the pressurant gas requirement in the pressurized discharge process of cryogenic tanks, and the two-side-insulated tank technique may be an alternative technique in the design of pressurization system.

SO CRYOGENICS

DE Helium injection; Nitrogen boiling suppression; Cryogenic thermal
   control system; Cryogenic external leakage testing
AB The testing of assemblies for use in cryogenic systems commonly includes evaluation at or near operating (therefore cryogenic) temperature. Typical assemblies include valves and pumps for use in liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen rocket engines. One frequently specified method of cryogenic external leakage testing requires the assembly, pressurized with gaseous helium (GHe), be immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen (LN2) and allowed to thermally stabilize. Component interfaces are then visually inspected for leakage (bubbles). Unfortunately the liquid nitrogen will be boiling under normal, bench-top, test conditions. This boiling tends to mask even significant leakage.
   One little known and perhaps under-utilized property of helium is the seemingly counter-intuitive thermodynamic property that when ambient temperature helium is bubbled through boiling LN2 at a temperature of -195.8 degrees C, the temperature of the liquid nitrogen will reduce.
   This paper reports on the design and testing of a novel proof-of-concept helium injection control system confirming that it is possible to reduce the temperature of an LN2 bath below boiling point through the controlled injection of ambient temperature gaseous helium and then to efficiently maintain a reduced helium flow rate to maintain a stabilized liquid temperature, enabling clear visual observation of components immersed within the LN2. Helium saturation testing is performed and injection system sizing is discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Flashing occurs when liquid undergoes a sudden depressurization and triggers a violent atomization and vaporization. This phenomenon may happen at the transient startup of the upper-stage rocket engine. In this paper, experimental investigation of cryogenic fluid injection into a low-pressure environment is performed using liquid nitrogen instead of the real cryogenic propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid methane). With the help of a high-speed shadowgraph technique and with the temperature measurement, the characteristics of flashing are explored, including its evolution process, the spray angle, the spray thermal behaviors along the injection centerline, and the spray phase solidification. The results show that bubble nucleation is a reasonable controlling factor for the flashing evolution process. The nondimensional energy barrier is conditionally indicative of the flashing transition process, and it works well under low injection temperature conditions. The drastic temperature drop due to flashing phenomena causes liquid jet solidification, which may pose a challenge for the engine startup process. An analysis of the spray lateral propagation indicates that superheat exerts a substantial effect on the spray angle enhancement; however, this enhanced effect is found to decrease with an increase of liquid superheat.

AB Testing was conducted using polyethylene as the porous fuel and gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer. Nominal test articles were tested using 100, 50, and 15 mu m pore sizes. Pressures tested ranged from atmospheric to 1194 kPa, and oxidizer injection velocities ranged from 35 to 80 m/s. Regression rates were determined using pretest and posttest length measurements of the solid fuel. Experimental results demonstrated that the regression rate of the porous axial-injection, end-burning hybrid was a function of the chamber pressure, as opposed to the oxidizer mass flux typical in conventional hybrids. Regression rates ranged from approximately 0.65 mm/s at atmospheric pressure to 7.74 mm/s at 1194 kPa. The analytical model was developed based on a standard ablative model modified to include oxidizer flow through the grain. The heat transfer from the flame was primarily modeled using an empirically determined flame coefficient that included all heat transfer mechanisms in one term. An exploratory flame model based on the granular diffusion flame model used for solid rocket motors was also adapted for comparison with the empirical flame coefficient. This model showed agreement with the experimental results, indicating that it has potential for giving insight into the flame structure in this motor configuration.

AB The addition of metal hydride improves the combustion performance of hybrid rocket fuels due to increased combustion temperature and hydrogen addition. However, the flame zone structure sensitivity to the addition of metal hydride has not been directly studied. This paper examines visible solid fuel flame height measurements and confirms these results with CH* chemiluminescence in an optically accessible combustor. In addition, the fuel combustion performance is considered using a traditional hybrid rocket combustor as a comparison to the optical chamber results. This paper investigates dicyclopentadiene as the primary fuel binder in gaseous oxygen flow. NaBH4 is studied as a fuel additive and is compared to aluminum and mechanically activated aluminum-polytetrafluoroethylene. Twenty-five wt % NaBH4 increases the regression rate of dicyclopentadiene by 19% due to increased hydrogen release into the flame zone. Enhanced blowing from the 25 wt % NaBH4 decomposition increases the dicyclopentadiene flame height by 44%. NaBH4 decomposition is rapid with respect to dicyclopentadiene pyrolysis, and as a result particle size reduction from 100-200 to 10-20 mu m has no appreciable effect on the fuel regression or flame height. The addition of aluminum and aluminum-polytetrafluoroethylene increases the regression rate due to enhanced heat release but does not impact the flame height like NaBH4.

TI Experimental Characterization of Combustion Instabilities in
   High-Mass-Flux Hybrid Rocket Engines
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB A test campaign to characterize the performance, combustion behavior, and blowoff limit at high mass flux levels of a particular hybrid rocket engine is presented and discussed. The test engine has a nominal thrust level of 300 N, with nitrous oxide (N2O) as oxidizer and polymethyl methacrylate as solid fuel. A total of 15 burns have been performed, at three different initial oxidizer mass flux levels: below, around, and above the 500-700 kg/s . m(2) range with a maximum tested mass flux higher than 1300 kg/s . m(2). No complete blowoff has been observed in the high-mass-flux regime; however, combustion instabilities and spontaneous engine operation shifting, leading to lower combustion efficiency, have been noticed. These phenomena have been analyzed and compared to the theoretical models available in open literature. With the knowledge obtained from the test campaign, the observed low-efficiency unstable behavior can effectively be prevented in future engines operating at high mass flux.

AB This article explores the possibility of analyzing combustion instabilities in liquid rocket engines by making use of Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Calculations are carried out for a complete small-scale rocket engine, including the injection manifold thrust chamber and nozzle outlet. The engine comprises 42 coaxial injectors feeding the combustion chamber with gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen and it operates at supercritical pressures with a maximum thermal power of 80 MW. The objective of the study is to predict the occurrence of transverse high-frequency combustion instabilities by comparing two operating points featuring different levels of acoustic activity. The LES compares favorably with the experiment for the stable load point and exhibits a nonlinearly unstable transverse mode for the experimentally unstable operating condition. A detailed analysis of the instability retrieves the experimental data in terms of spectral features. It is also found that modifications of the flame structures and of the global combustion region configuration have similarities with those observed in recent model scale experiments. It is shown that the overall acoustic activity mainly results from the combination of one transverse and one radial mode of the chamber, which are also strongly coupled with the oxidizer injectors.

AB This paper is aimed to analyse the combustion characteristics of hybrid rocket motor with multi-section swirl injection by simulating the combustion flow field. Numerical combustion flow field and combustion performance parameters are obtained through three-dimensional numerical simulations based on a steady numerical model proposed in this paper. The hybrid rocket motor adopts 98% hydrogen peroxide and polyethylene as the propellants. Multiple injection sections are set along the axis of the solid fuel grain, and the oxidizer enters the combustion chamber by means of tangential injection via the injector ports in the injection sections. Simulation results indicate that the combustion flow field structure of the hybrid rocket motor could be improved by multi-section swirl injection method. The transformation of the combustion flow field can greatly increase the fuel regression rate and the combustion efficiency. The average fuel regression rate of the motor with multi-section swirl injection is improved by 8.37 times compared with that of the motor with conventional head-end irrotational injection. The combustion efficiency is increased to 95.73%. Besides, the simulation results also indicate that (1) the additional injection sections can increase the fuel regression rate and the combustion efficiency; (2) the upstream offset of the injection sections reduces the combustion efficiency; and (3) the fuel regression rate and the combustion efficiency decrease with the reduction of the number of injector ports in each injection section.

AB For shear coaxial injectors, which are widely used in liquid oxygen-gaseous hydrogen rocket engines, the key parameters that characterize injector geometry are the recess length, taper angle, and wall thickness of the liquid oxygen post, which is the inner tube of the coaxial injector. In the present study, the effects of the recessed length and taper angle of the liquid oxygen post on cryogenic coaxial jets at supercritical pressures were experimentally investigated. The large-scale structure and mixing enhancement of cryogenic nitrogen and gaseous helium coaxial jets were evaluated using a high-speed backlighting technique. Instantaneous backlit images revealed that the dark core, which is believed to be dense nitrogen, exhibited sinusoidal forms induced by the presence of the outer helium jets. However, the sinusoidal oscillations were less influenced by the injector geometry. The mixing enhancement of coaxial jets was evaluated with respect to the dark-core length and the jet spread angle. The recessed liquid oxygen post enhanced the mixing of cryogenic nitrogen when the recess length was sufficiently large, which suggests that a recess of a certain length is required to improve the mixing of cryogenic coaxial jets at supercritical pressures. Because the decrease in the dark-core length with the recessed length was consistent with the increase in the jet spread angle at the injector exit, the mixing enhancement caused by the recess can be regarded as a result of an improvement in the mixing between the inner and outer jets in the recessed region. The effects of the liquid oxygen post exit taper on the mixing enhancement were more significant than those of the recess. The decrease in the dark-core length with the inner-toouter momentum flux ratio (J number) is consistent with the relevant empirical correlation at supercritical pressures. Therefore, the mixing enhancement caused by the liquid oxygen post exit taper can be considered the result of an increase in the J number, rather than the result of giving azimuthal velocity to the cryogenic nitrogen jet at the liquid oxygen post exit.

AB A conventional bullet or projectile driven by solid fuels accelerates in the barrel and reaches certain muzzle velocity, spin and propulsion energies. Combustion characteristics of solid fuels are the most important factor affecting bullet performance and maximum range. In this work, double base solid propellants of spherical geometry within the ranges of 300-425, 425-500, 500-600, 600-710 and 710-850 mu m in diameter and temperatures of -60, -40, -20, 0, 20, 40 and 60 degrees C, were investigated in terms of the effects of grain size and temperature on burn rate, internal barrel pressure and bullet velocity. Solid fuel properties such as fuel heat of combustion, density, combustion temperature, particle size and mass were measured. In a constant volume chamber, burn rate was measured for each fuel sample at different pressure and temperature. In addition, cartridges of 7.62 mmin diameter were made using sample solid fuels, and shooting tests were carried out with a special test barrel. In the tests, strains along the barrel were determined using strain gauges and the muzzle exit velocity of the bullet was measured with a doppler radar for calibrations. It was seen that the increase of fuel temperature and decrease of particle size increased burn rate, internal barrel pressure and bullet velocity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Hybrid rocket motor; Low frequency instability; Combustion experiment
AB Hybrid rocket combustion frequently displays a sudden amplification of combustion pressures leading into low frequency instability (LFI) with peak frequency of 10-20 Hz. A series of experimental tests was designed to examine the triggering mechanism of LFI, which occurred at a certain combustion condition. To this end, a couple of parameters was selected and the sensitivity of each parameter to instability was evaluated including volume ratios between main and post chambers, oxidizer mass flow rates, and solid fuel types. The results showed that the initiation of LFI was related to the flow modifications caused by vortex shedding and volume ratios between main and post chambers. Once LFI was initiated at a certain chamber configuration, the variation of oxidizer mass flow rates and the use of different solid fuel did not alter the triggering mechanism of LFI. Additional attention was focused to understand the critical role of vortex shedding on the initiation of LFI in the post chamber. The results confirmed that pressure oscillations by the thermal lag of solid fuel could be suddenly amplified, which leads to LFI in the case of resonating with unknown sources of pressure oscillations associated with vortex shedding in the post chamber. However, the details of triggering mechanism and the coupling of vortex shedding with additional pressure perturbations still remain unresolved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Computational tools of turbulent combustion have practical applications for various fields including liquid rocket engines, but some numerical issues are still presented for solving supercritical combustion. In the present study, several of these numerical issues are studied and discussed. Turbulent flow and thermal fields of gaseous hydrogen/cryogenic liquid oxygen flame at supercritical pressure are simulated by a turbulence model. To realize real-fluid combustions, the modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state (EOS) are implemented into the flamelet model with a look-up table as functions of mean and variance of mixture fraction, scalar dissipation rate, enthalpy, and pressure. For supercritical combustion flows, modified forms of the pressure implicit with splitting of operator (PISO) algorithm for solving the pressure-velocity linked equation are introduced. From a comparison of instantaneous temperature distributions for gaseous hydrogen/cryogenic liquid oxygen flame at supercritical pressure, the capability of each method based on the different solution sequence is examined and the effective sequence is explored. The results show that the updated mixture fraction reflected in the pressure correction loop is a critical factor for numerical stability. Also, the relative performance of six convection schemes for supercritical combustion is discussed.

AB In this study, the performance of regenerative cooling system for large expansion ratio rocket engines (A(epsilon)/A(t) similar to 100) is investigated numerically. During combustion and gas expansion, the walls of the combustion chamber and the rocket nozzle are exposed to high temperature gas (similar to 3500 K), which can ultimately lead to structural failure. Therefore, to protect the hardware from thermal failure, a regenerative cooling system for a cryogenic rocket engine that uses fuel (liquid hydrogen (LH)) or oxidizer (liquid oxygen (LOX)) as the cooling medium is considered. Three-dimensional simulations have been performed for both constant and variable fluid properties. The influence of the thermal properties of the material and thickness of the nozzle wall on conductive heat transfer has also been investigated. The effect of radiative heat transfer when there is no regenerative cooling system has been analyzed. In addition, heat transfer enhancement for different turbulence models and the influence of coolant used (both the fuel and oxidizer) is also investigated. It is evident from the results that a properly designed regenerative cooling system can maintain the hot side wall at a temperature well below the melting point of the wall material, which ensures the protection of nozzle hardware from thermal failure. Also, the predicted pressure drop is found to be 0.7 bar, which meets the design requirement. Numerical predictions are validated with the data available in literature.

AB Sufficient knowledge of thermal performance and pressurization behaviors in cryogenic tanks during rocket launching period is of importance to the design and optimization of a pressurization system. In this paper, ground experiments with liquid oxygen (LO2) as the cryogenic propellant, high-temperature helium exceeding 600 K as the pressurant gas, and radial diffuser and anti-cone diffuser respectively at the tank inlet were performed. The pressurant gas requirements, axial and radial temperature distributions, and energy distributions inside the propellant tank were obtained and analyzed to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the pressurization system. It was found that the pressurization system with high-temperature helium as the pressurant gas could work well that the tank pressure was controlled within a specified range and a stable discharging liquid rate was achieved. For the radial diffuser case, the injected gas had a direct impact on the tank inner wall. The severe gas-wall heat transfer resulted in about 59% of the total input energy absorbed by the tank wall. For the pressurization case with anti-cone diffuser, the direct impact of high-temperature gas flowing toward the liquid surface resulted in a greater deal of energy transferred to the liquid propellant, and the percentage even reached up to 38%. Moreover, both of the two cases showed that the proportion of energy left in ullage to the total input energy was quite small, and the percentage was only about 22-24%. This may indicate that a more efficient diffuser should be developed to improve the pressurization effect. Generally, the present experimental results are beneficial to the design and optimization of the pressurization system with high-temperature gas supplying the pressurization effect.

AB Background: Cooking over open fires using solid fuels is both common practice throughout much of the world and widely recognized to contribute to human health, environmental, and social problems. The public health burden of household air pollution includes an estimated four million premature deaths each year. To be effective and generate useful insight into potential solutions, cookstove intervention studies must select cooking technologies that are appropriate for local socioeconomic conditions and cooking culture, and include interdisciplinary measurement strategies along a continuum of outcomes.
   Methods/Design: REACCTING (Research on Emissions, Air quality, Climate, and Cooking Technologies in Northern Ghana) is an ongoing interdisciplinary randomized cookstove intervention study in the Kassena-Nankana District of Northern Ghana. The study tests two types of biomass burning stoves that have the potential to meet local cooking needs and represent different "rungs" in the cookstove technology ladder: a locally-made low-tech rocket stove and the imported, highly efficient Philips gasifier stove. Intervention households were randomized into four different groups, three of which received different combinations of two improved stoves, while the fourth group serves as a control for the duration of the study. Diverse measurements assess different points along the causal chain linking the intervention to final outcomes of interest. We assess stove use and cooking behavior, cooking emissions, household air pollution and personal exposure, health burden, and local to regional air quality. Integrated analysis and modeling will tackle a range of interdisciplinary science questions, including examining ambient exposures among the regional population, assessing how those exposures might change with different technologies and behaviors, and estimating the comparative impact of local behavior and technological changes versus regional climate variability and change on local air quality and health outcomes.
   Discussion: REACCTING is well-poised to generate useful data on the impact of a cookstove intervention on a wide range of outcomes. By comparing different technologies side by side and employing an interdisciplinary approach to study this issue from multiple perspectives, this study may help to inform future efforts to improve health and quality of life for populations currently relying on open fires for their cooking needs.

AB Vortices generation and flow dynamics are investigated by a numerical calculation with LES methodology on the evaporative surface including chemical reactions. For simplicity, fuel is radially injected from the surface in order to decouple pyrolysis of solid fuel from the governing equation and consideration of heat transfer balance. Nevertheless its simple treatment of chemical reactions and fuel pyrolysis, numerical results captured very fundamental understandings in terms of averaged temperature, velocity profile, and mixture fraction distribution. Results showed that a well-defined turbulent velocity profile at the inlet becomes twisted and highly wrinkled in the downstream reaching the maximum velocity at far above the surface, where the flame is located. And the thickness of boundary layer increases in the downstream due to the enhanced interaction of axial flow and mass injection from the surface. Also, chemical reaction appears highly active and partially concentrated along the plane where flow condition is in stoichiometric. In particular, flame front locates at the surface where mixture fraction Z equals to 0.07. Flame front severely wrinkles in the downstream by the interaction with turbulences in the flow. Partial reactions on the flame front contribute to produce hot spots periodically in the downstream attaining the max temperature at the center of each spot. This may take the role of additional unsteady heat generations and pressure perturbations in the downstream. Future study will focus on the evolution of hot spots and pressure perturbations in the post chamber of lab scale hybrid rocket motors.

AB This paper investigates the morphology of a flash-atomizing jet at conditions representative for rocket engine operations. Due to its relevance for the aerospace industry, both storable and cryogenic rocket engine propellants are considered, namely ethanol [as inert equivalent of monomethyl hydrazine (MMH)] and liquid oxygen (LOx). A comparison between the flashing behavior of these two fluids is conducted. Despite the differences in their physical properties, a close similarity in the spray characteristics is found in terms of spray shape, spreading angles, and evolution of the flashing regimes as a function of the initial superheat. Based on this similarity, the applicability of a novel, nucleation-based onset criterion (chi parameter) for the fully flashing regime is verified for cryogenic propellants, showing a satisfactory agreement. This result has important implications. First, it corroborates that jet disintegration at highly superheated conditions is mainly controlled by the kinetics of phase transitions (i.e., the nucleation rate). Second, it explains the differences in the degree of superheat (R-p) at onset of the fully flashing regime between ethanol and LOx sprays, respectively. The low operating temperatures in cryogenic systems result in a significant increase of the energy barrier to nucleation. Consequently, the inception of nucleate boiling can occur either at significantly higher R-p values (homogeneous process) or may be triggered by heterogeneous effects. The associated increase of the chi parameter at the onset provides a good indication of the transition to heterogeneous nucleate boiling.

AB This study is concerned with the mechanical properties of homogenous solid propellants. The experimental results demonstrate the high strain rate sensitivity of these materials. A modified viscoplastic model of the Bodner-Partom type was applied to simulate the nonlinear behaviour of solid propellants when subjected to uni-axial loading conditions. The material parameters of the constitutive law were identified numerically using the evolutionary algorithm. The capability of the proposed approach was investigated for a representative solid fuel sample. The efficiency of the method is discussed.

AB Throttling technology is a key technology for future space transportation system. One of the most important components of the rocket engine for thrust control is the propellant injection system. The pintle injector is one of the most promising candidates due to its simple structure and combustion stability. However, the number of studies on the pintle injector is limited and detailed phenomena of the pintle injector has not been clarified. Therefore, a combustion test using an ethanol/liquid oxygen rocket engine is carried out with a planar pintle injector in a rectangular combustor. Fundamental combustion characteristics such as characteristic exhaust velocity efficiency are acquired at the combustion pressure of 0.45 MPa and O/F=1.25 to 1.80. C* efficiency increases as the equivalence ratio increases up to unity. Flame images during combustion at 0.45 MPa and O/F=1.75 were acquired. Luminous flame was not observed in throughout all of the region except for the vicinity of the faceplate. However, strong luminous flame was observed at the time of ignition. The combustion chamber used in this research can simulate one of the recirculation zones observed in actual combustor with pintle-type injectors, which contributes to the combustion stability. However, the recirculation zone formed at the top of the injector is not simulated appropriately due to the existence of the lower wall of the combustor.

AB Large solid rocket motors are subjected to pressure oscillations for which the origin lies in the coupling between hydrodynamic instabilities and the first longitudinal acoustic modes of the combustion chamber. Static firing tests using two propellant grains in the combustion chamber have been performed. The pressure oscillation amplitude can be strongly modified by varying the burn velocity ratio between the two solid fuel grains. The pressure oscillations are significantly reduced when increasing the burn velocity of the upstream grain and are higher in the opposite case.

AB A composition consisting of 80% polytetrafluoroethylene and 20% boron (by weight) was considered as a potential high-density solid fuel mixture for mixed hybrid rocket propulsive applications. Constant-pressure strand burner experiments for the given formulation indicated a low-pressure self-deflagration limit of approximately 2.2 MPa (319 psia), and a burning rate correlation r(b)[cm/s] = 0.042(P[MPa])(0.531) was determined. Pressurized counterflow burner experiments conducted using pure oxygen revealed formation of surface char, which prevented measurement of solid fuel regression rates below 2 MPa, indicating an additional resistance for heat and mass transfer. Static-fired rocket motor experiments, conducted to determine the pressure and flow dependencies of the system, exhibited characteristic exhaust velocity efficiencies ranging from approximately 86 to 96%. Whereas classical hybrids do not have a strong dependence of fuel regression rate on pressure, a pressure dependence was observed in this system below the low-pressure self-deflagration limit due to the pressure dependence of the decomposition and fluorination kinetics of the solid fuel mixture. Below the low-pressure self-deflagration limit, the motor operated at a constant pressure, typical of a classical hybrid, whereas above the limit, a progressive burn was observed, characteristic of a composite propellant. Systematic oxidizer dilution with nitrogen revealed a decrease in pressurization rate with decreasing oxygen content, and an ignition limit was achieved for this system when the oxygen mass fraction was reduced from 0.65 to 0.6. Characteristic exhaust velocity efficiencies were not noticeably affected by oxidizer dilution with nitrogen over the range considered.

AB The main goal of this paper is to study the characteristics of regression rate of solid grain during thrust regulation process. For this purpose, an unsteady numerical model of regression rate is established. Gas-solid coupling is considered between the solid grain surface and combustion gas. Dynamic mesh is used to simulate the regression process of the solid fuel surface. Based on this model, numerical simulations on a H2O2/HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) hybrid motor have been performed in the flow control process. The simulation results show that under the step change of the oxidizer mass flow rate condition, the regression rate cannot reach a stable value instantly because the flow field requires a short time period to adjust. The regression rate increases with the linear gain of oxidizer mass flow rate, and has a higher slope than the relative inlet function of oxidizer flow rate. A shorter regulation time can cause a higher regression rate during regulation process. The results also show that transient calculation can better simulate the instantaneous regression rate in the operation process.

AB The fuel regression rate is an important parameter in the design process of the hybrid rocket motor. Additives in the solid fuel may have influences on the fuel regression rate, which will affect the internal ballistics of the motor. A series of firing experiments have been conducted on lab-scale hybrid rocket motors with 98% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidizer and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based fuels in this paper. An innovative fuel regression rate analysis method is established to diminish the errors caused by start and tailing stages in a short time firing test. The effects of the metal Mg, Al, aromatic hydrocarbon anthracene (C14H10), and carbon black (C) on the fuel regression rate are investigated. The fuel regression rate formulas of different fuel components are fitted according to the experiment data. The results indicate that the influence of C14H10 on the fuel regression rate of HTPB is not evident. However, the metal additives in the HTPB fuel can increase the fuel regression rate significantly. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Experimental validation of a thermal model of a LOx flooded ball bearing
SO TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Ball bearing; Cryogenics; Thermal conduction
AB Ball bearings of turbopumps of rocket engines work in very singular conditions; they are flooded into liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen. Therefore, the use of any conventional lubricants (oil or grease) is prescribed. Although cryogenic fluids can cool this kind of ball bearing, they cannot separate the surfaces in contact. As a result, there is a significant increase in frictional power losses. This paper presents tests performed on a cryotechnic ball bearing flooded in liquid oxygen. The test results showed that beyond a critical loading of the bearing, a sudden increase in temperature occurred. A thermal model is also put forward, in order to understand and anticipate especially the thermal instability described above. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Combustion stability characteristics in a small-scale combustor with seven liquid-liquid bi-swirl coaxial injectors were studied experimentally. Liquid oxygen and kerosene (Jet A-1) were burned in a fuel-rich combustor simulating a liquid rocket engine gas generator. While changing mixture ratios between 0.286 and 0.370, static pressure, temperature, and dynamic pressure data in the propellant manifolds and combustion chamber were acquired. In addition, chamber pressures were varied between 47.9 bar and 69.0 bar, which covered the sub- and supercritical pressures of oxygen. When the chamber pressure was above the critical pressure of oxygen, dominant pressure waves were not encountered. However, when the chamber pressure was below the critical pressure of oxygen, low-frequency pressure oscillations were found to develop in the manifolds and combustion chamber. Additionally, the amplitude of such low-frequency pressure oscillations increased as the pressure drop across the fuel-side injector was reduced. Accordingly, the effects of chamber pressure and pressure drop across the injectors must be carefully considered when designing a swirl coaxial injector operating in fuel-rich conditions.

AB An opposed flow burner is examined as an instrument to screen and characterize fuel before full-scale hybrid rocket testing. This device requires small amounts (similar to 10 g) of solid fuels, and it can save time and material in early phases of fuel characterization. Although impinging jet configurations have been investigated in the past, the full range of operation of these systems in terms of hybrid rocket motor flowfield conditions has not been fully explored. The regression rate, flame structure, and flame temperature in an opposed burner configuration is investigated, and an analysis to relate the results to hybrid rocket applications is developed. Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, dicyclopentadiene, and paraffin are investigated via an opposed flow burner over an oxidizer mass flux range of 4 to 25 kg/s/m(2). Results show solid-fuel regression rate sensitivity to laminar and turbulent flow regimes. Aluminized hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene regresses similar to 34% slower than neat fuel in the opposed flow burner. Infrared spectroscopy reveals peak flame temperatures of the samples tested, ranging from 1850 to 2100 K. Although the opposed flow burner is not a perfect representation of hybrid rocket motor operation, it may prove useful in small-scale screening of fuels.

TI Optimization of Hybrid Upper-Stage Motor with Coupled
   Evolutionary/Indirect Procedure
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMAL-DESIGN; ROCKET MOTORS; COMBUSTION
AB Upper-stage motors used in small launchers constitute an application where hybrid rocket motors may be competitive. A coupled optimization of motor design and trajectory is needed for such an application due to mission characteristics and motor features. The present article presents a cooperative evolutionary method nested with an indirect approach to perform the coupled optimization of hybrid rocket motor and trajectory for an upper stage. The evolutionary method optimizes the parameters that affect the motor design (e.g., grain geometry) and feed system, whereas the indirect method optimizes the trajectory (i.e., thrust direction and motor switching times) for a given motor and mission. A mission profile based on the Vega launcher is considered and the performance index is the payload inserted into the final orbit. The hybrid rocket motor powers the third and last stage and has a pressurizing feed system that is partially regulated. The characteristics of the first and second solid rocket motor stages are assigned and kept constant, but the whole trajectory is optimized from liftoff to orbit. Different propellant combinations are considered and effects of throat erosion are discussed. Results show that the liquid oxygen/wax propellant combination has the best performance. This combination can be used with a single-port grain and presents a potential gain of about 350 kg with respect to other propellant combinations. Multiport grains must be adopted when more classical fuels are considered, to have acceptable values of the length-to-diameter ratio.

TI Cryogenic thermal system analysis for orbital propellant depot

AB In any manned mission architecture, upwards of seventy percent of all payload delivered to orbit is propellant, and propellant mass fraction dominates almost all transportation segments of any mission requiring a heavy lift launch system like the Saturn V. To mitigate this, the use of an orbital propellant depot has been extensively studied. In this paper, a thermal model of an orbital propellant depot is used to examine the effects of passive and active thermal management strategies. Results show that an all passive thermal management strategy results in significant boil-off for both hydrogen and oxygen. At current launch vehicle prices, these boil-offs equate to millions of dollars lost per month. Zero boil-off of propellant is achievable with the use of active cryocoolers; however, the cooling power required to produce zero-boil-off is an order of magnitude higher than current state-of-the-art cryocoolers. This study shows a zero-boil-off cryocooler minimum power requirement of 80-100 W at 80 K for liquid oxygen, and 100-120 W at 20 K for liquid hydrogen for a representative Near-Earth Object mission. Research and development effort is required to improve the state-of-the-arts in-space cryogenic thermal management. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An experimental study has been carried out to study the effects of recess length in swirl coaxial injectors on heat transfer in a combustion chamber with cooling channels. Liquid oxygen and kerosene (Jet A-1) were burned in a range of mixture ratios (2.12-3.07) and chamber pressures (57.3-82.3 bar) in small liquid rocket thrust chambers. Each thrust chamber had nineteen liquid-liquid swirl coaxial injectors. While changing the recess length of the injectors and operating conditions, temperatures of the cooling water passing through the cooling channels were collected and analyzed to calculate the heat flux in the combustion chamber. As expected, operating conditions such as oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratio and chamber pressure had a large influence on the heat flux in the combustion chamber. The recess length of the injectors also significantly affected the heat flux in the combustion chamber, which showed that the longer recess length gradually increased the heat flux. It is thought that the variation of flame structure with respect to the recess length in swirl coaxial injectors was the main reason. Since heat flux is a very important factor in designing cooling channels, the effects of recess length on heat flux in a combustion chamber must be carefully considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Burning Rate Optimization Under Uncertainty Using Response Surfaces and
   Monte Carlo Simulation
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Response surface methods were applied to a model for regression rate of the solid fuel grain in a mixed oxidizer hybrid rocket. A Monte Carlo simulation-based uncertainty analysis was developed and applied to experimentally determine response surface coefficients and was further integrated into maximization and optimization runs to provide bounding upper and lower uncertainty limits on burning rate as a function of grain composition and motor operating conditions. The regression or burning rate model incorporates motor chamber pressure and injected gaseous oxidizer mass flux as well as solid-propellant formulation effects. Existing experimental data were used to determine model parameters, which subsequently framed a set of optimization case scenarios for maximization of regression rate and exploration of mixture and operational space with specified burning rate constraints. Line contour and response surface plots were generated to aid in visualization of results, including plots of nominal upper and lower uncertainties of burning rate as a function of composition at 95% confidence level. This analysis determines the optimum solid-propellant fuel compositions to optimize the regression rate of a mixed-oxidizer hybrid grain under specified operating conditions.

TI Coupling of Cryogenic Oxygen-Hydrogen Flames to Longitudinal and

DT Article
ID COMBUSTION INSTABILITIES
AB A rectangular combustor with acoustic forcing was used to study flame-acoustic interaction under injection conditions that are representative of liquid propellant rocket engines. Hot-fire tests using liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen were conducted at pressures of 40 and 60 bar, which are sub-and supercritical conditions, respectively, for oxygen. Examined samples of hydroxyl-radical emission imaging, collected using a high-speed camera during periods of forced acoustic resonance, showed significant response in the multi-injection element flame. Fluctuating acoustic pressure causes in-phase fluctuation of the emission intensity, producing response factor values of around 0.8. Transverse acoustic velocity causes shortening of the flame, concentrating heat release near the injection plane. The flame is also convectively displaced with transverse acoustic velocity, a process believed by many to be responsible for driving transverse mode high-frequency combustion instabilities. The analysis in this work was extended to detect the response of internal flame processes to the transverse acoustic disturbance, namely, pressure response and enhanced transport and mixing of non-premixed propellants. A flame-tracking technique was implemented to isolate the response of these processes from that of collective convective displacement. The results show a significant contribution to overall flame response from the response of internal processes; however, further work is required to quantify the relative contributions of pressure or propellant transport.

TI Nitrous Oxide and Oxygen Mixtures (Nytrox) as Oxidizers for Rocket
   Propulsion Applications
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUILIBRIA; EQUATION; STATE
AB Most of the oxidizers available to be used in chemical propulsion applications are highly hazardous materials that are either toxic or explosive in nature. Among the short list of oxidizing agents, liquid oxygen (O-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) stand out as the most practical propellants due to their wide availability, broad base of use, cost effectiveness, and relatively benign nature. A new class of oxidizers (Nytrox) that are composed of equilibrium or nonequilibrium mixtures of nitrous oxide and oxygen are formulated in order to maximize the benefits of the pure components while retaining their practical advantages. Note that in the mixture O-2 serves as the pressurizing agent, whereas N2O is the densifying component. The primary advantages of this new system over the pure oxidizers can be listed as 1) self-pressurization capability, 2) high density and density impulse, 3) noncryogenic operational temperatures, 4) higher 1,, performance compared with N2O, 4) improved safety, 5) efficient gas-phase combustion, and 6) easier development of stable and efficient motors compared with liquid oxygen due to the exothermic decomposition of the N2O molecule. Unlike the pure oxidizers, the mixture allows for two independent control variables (temperature and pressure), which can be fine tuned to optimize the system for a particular application.

AB This study is concerned with the coordinated control problem for regulation/protection mode-switching of a ducted rocket, in order to obtain the maximum system performance while ensuring safety. The proposed strategy has an inner/outer loop control structure which decomposes the contradiction between performance and safety into two modes of regulation and protection. Specifically, first, the mathematical model including the actuator (gas regulating system) and the plant (ducted rocket engine) is introduced. Second, taking the inlet buzz for instance, the ducted rocket coordinated control problem for thrust regulation and inlet buzz limit protection is formulated and discussed. Third, to solve the problem, based on the main inner loop, a limit protection controller (outer loop) design method is developed utilizing a linear quadratic optimal control technique, and a coordinated control logic is then presented. At last, the whole coordinated control strategy is applied to the ducted rocket control model, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This communication presents thermal diffusivity measurements of fourteen layered insulating composite materials. Composite materials that were taken under investigation contained matrixes based on epoxy and phenol-formaldehyde resins and reinforcements, such as glass, basalt fiber and wrapping or ceramic paper. They were all prepared by the Rocket Section of the Students Space Association (RS-SSA). Manufacturing process of samples is described. Additional objective of this research was to obtain the quality of such prepared materials and if they are reliable enough to be used in solid-fuel rocket motors. Use of composite materials to build combustion chamber walls of solid fuel rocket engines, rather than metal, leads to weight reduction and increases amount of fuel that rocket can carry. That improves performances and gives new possibilities for rocket applications. To apply new high performance solid fuels, development of new composite materials was required. Analysis of thermal properties gives the answer, which material should be used for new solid-fuel rockets designed by RS-SSA.

AB Hybrid combustors are of increasing interest for space and civilian propulsion. A test facility has been settled to investigate high-density polyethylene combustion (propellant of length 0.15 m). A parametric study has been conducted on the oxidiser nature (gaseous oxygen diluted in nitrogen, from 31.4vol.% to 69.2vol.% of O-2), on the oxidiser flow rate (from 28.6 g/s to 53.1 g/s), on the combustor pressure (from 11.4 bar to 25 bar) and on the nozzle diameter (from 6.4 mm to 12.9 mm). The regression rate has been estimated by weight loss (mean value of 0.207 mg/s) and by thermocouples (0.198 mg/s). Its values are compared to existing data through the Marxman law; this enlarges the range of validity of this law. The conduction heat flux in the solid reducer is estimated around 6000-8000 W; which is related to the low regression rate of the solid fuel. The axial thrust has been measured in addition to other parameters (pressures, temperatures and mass flow rates). Solid particles have been gathered at the combustor outlet to conduct additional chemical analyses. These particles were formed at the surface of the reducer and extracted by the oxidiser from the solid surface.

DT Article
ID ROCKET ENGINE; LIQUID JET; COMBUSTION
AB Testing has been conducted with the BKH rocket combustor at the European Research and Technology Test Facility P8 for cryogenic rocket engines at DLR Lampoldshausen. BKH has multiple shear coaxial injectors and an exhaust modulation system for forcing excitation of acoustic resonances in the combustion chamber. Optical access windows allow the application of parallel high-speed shadowgraph and flame emission imaging of the near-injector region. This paper reports measurements of the intact liquid oxygen core during forced excitation of the first transverse acoustic mode. High-speed shadowgraph images show that the mechanism of core breakup and atomization differs between off-resonance and first transverse excitation conditions. The core length is found to decrease with increasing amplitude of acoustic pressure, or equivalently with transverse acoustic velocity, with a core length reduction of up to 70% for conditions approaching those of naturally occurring high frequency combustion instabilities. This dependence is shown to be distinguishable for differing operating conditions of the combustor. Fluctuation in core length also decreases with increasing excitation amplitude. Knowledge of the influence of the transverse acoustic field on the LOx core is important for understanding the driving mechanisms of combustion instabilities.

AB In this article, solid fuel transient burning behavior under oxidizer gas flow is numerically investigated. It is accomplished by the analysis of regression rate responses to the imposed sudden and oscillatory variations at inflow properties. The conjugate problem is considered by simultaneous solution of flow and solid-phase governing equations to compute the fuel regression rate. The advection upstream splitting method is used as the flow computational scheme in a finite volume method. The ignition phase is completely simulated to obtain the exact initial condition for response analysis. The results show that the transient burning effects that lead to the combustion instabilities and intermittent extinctions could be observed in solid fuels such as solid propellants.

AB The new international attention to hybrid space propulsion points out the need of a deeper understanding of physico-chemical phenomena controlling combustion process and fluid dynamics inside the motor. This research project has been carried on by a network of four Italian Universities; each of them being responsible for a specific topic. The task of Politecnico di Milano is an experimental activity concerning the study, development, manufacturing and characterization of advanced hybrid solid fuels with a high regression rate. The University of Naples is responsible for experimental activities focused on rocket motor scale characterization of the solid fuels developed and characterized at laboratory scale by Politecnico di Milano. The University of Rome has been studying the combustion chamber and nozzle of the hybrid rocket, defined in the coordinated program by advanced physical-mathematical models and numerical methods. Politecnico di Torino has been working on a multidisciplinary optimization code for optimal design of hybrid rocket motors, strongly related to the mission to be performed. The overall research project aims to increase the scientific knowledge of the combustion processes in hybrid rockets, using a strongly linked experimental-numerical approach. Methods and obtained results will be applied to implement a potential upgrade for the current generation of hybrid rocket motors. This paper presents the overall strategy, the organization, and the first experimental and numerical results of this joined effort to contribute to the development of improved hybrid propulsion systems.

   Oxidizer; Lie group; Similarity solution; Phase portrait

AB Boundary layer combustion is the primary mechanism of hot gas generation in hybrid rockets. The idea of a hybrid rocket is to store the oxidizer as a liquid and the fuel as a solid, producing a design that is less susceptible to chemical explosion than conventional solid and bipropellant liquid designs. The fuel is contained within the rocket combustion chamber in the form of a cylinder, with a circular channel called a port hollowed out along its axis. Upon ignition, a diffusion flame forms over the fuel surface along the length of the port. The combustion is sustained by heat transfer from the flame to the solid fuel causing continuous fuel vaporization until the oxidizer flow is turned off. Theory shows that the fuel mass transfer rate is proportional to the mass flux averaged across the port. The mass flow rate increases with axial distance, leading to coupling between the local fuel regression rate and the local mass flux. For proper design, accurate expressions are needed for both the time-dependent oxidizer-to-fuel ratio at the end of the port and the time at which all the fuel is consumed. As the fuel is depleted, the flame approaches the motor case, at which point the burn must be terminated. The purpose of this paper is to present a similarity solution for the coupled problem and a brief discussion of current practice.

AB The spiral groove face seal is a prime candidate for application of the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen turbopump. The study investigated the designs of the electro-magnetic loading device (EMLD) and friction torque testing device (FTTD), and their application in the interface experiments of face seals with spiral grooves which used water as the sealing fluid. The seal performance parameters, including face temperature, face friction torque, film pressure at the seal dam, were measured under the static balance position, and the effects of the face closing force, which varied with the axial load generated from the EMLD, on the seal performance were tested under a specific controlled mode. The result indicated that both the pressure at the seal dam and face temperature increased with the rotating speed and that small friction was obtained when the face seal was fully film-lubricated. The separation speed of the controllable seal could also be controlled, which helped seal faces lift off and met the conditions of the face noncontact status. Additionally, with the application of the EMLD and FTTD, seal operation monitoring was rendered possible and a controllable face seal with desirable performance was achieved. The findings of the current study lend great insights into engineering seal design and its applications.

AB At present, metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) have been widely studied for their potential in high-density energetic materials and nanotechnology, but the relatively low-pressure discharge in a short period of time and the oxidation of Al powders have seriously impeded their applications in rocket solid fuels and explosives. In this work, the authors successfully fabricated microstructured Al/Fe2O3/nitrocellulose (Al/Fe2O3/NC) fibers via simple electrospinning, introducing nitrocellulose (NC), a gas generator to MICs. In view of previous reports, wrapping nAl in NC fibers might reduce their further oxidation during storage. In addition, the thermal properties and elastic modulus of NC fibers were measured before and after adding Al/Fe2O3.

AB Flame spread and counterflow diffusion flame experiments are widely conducted to investigate the combustibility of solid fuels. Although the use of the gas phase Damkohler number to organize the flame spread rate or regression rate of a solid fuel is effective under constant pressure, some research point out the possibility that the combustion pressure may be an independent factor in determining the regression rate. This research employs a counterflow diffusion flame to investigate the effects of combustion pressure on regression rate, and clarifies the deviation of results using the classical Damkohler number under varying pressures. First, a numerical flow analysis was conducted to determine the oxidizer velocity gradient near the fuel surface, which is an essential factor in evaluating the non-dimensional regression rate. Next, using an enclosed combustion chamber with independently variable oxidizer flux and pressure, experiments with a quasi two-dimensional flame were conducted with polyethylene solid fuel and nitrogen diluted oxygen oxidizer, and the regression rate was measured for two experiment series, constant pressure, and constant oxidizer flux. By comparing the two series, the effect of pressure on non-dimensionalized regression rate is clarified. The results suggest that contrary to the theoretical reaction rate of the gas phase, the non-dimensional regression rate increases when the combustion pressure is decreased, even in the thermal regime. This suggests that the classic method of organizing the regression rate with Damkohler number in thermal regime could not be implemented with varying pressure conditions, possibly due to the change in diffusion rates involved with varying pressures.

AB The aim of this work was to synthesize a polyurethane polymer matrix using polyols as a raw material to obtain a binder such as the hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) pre-polymer in energetic material formulation. The soybean-based polyol was the best starting raw material for producing a binder for solid fuel formulation in rocket motor applications. Characterization of the obtained soybean-based polyurethane binder was carried out by employing FT-IR analysis and thermo analytical techniques that showed similar HTPB binder thermo decomposition behaviors, confirming their potential for use as polymer matrix composites.

AB A single-stage launch vehicle with hybrid rocket engine, which uses solid fuel and liquid oxidizer, has been studied and developed as a next-generation rocket for scientific observation due to the advantages as low cost, safety, re-ignition, and reduced pollution. Thereupon, the knowledge regarding hybrid rocket system has been gained through the forepart of the conceptual design using design informatics. In the present study, the practical problem defined by using three objective functions and seven design variables for aurora observation is treated so as to contribute the real world using evolutionary computation and data mining for the field of aerospace engineering. The primary objective of the design in the present study is that the down range and the duration time in the lower thermosphere are sufficiently obtained for the aurora scientific observation, whereas the initial gross weight is held down. Investigated solid fuels are five, while liquid oxidizer is considered as liquid oxygen. A hybrid rocket uses one of five kinds of fuels. The condition of single-time ignition is assumed in flight sequence in order to quantitatively investigate the ascendancy of multi-time ignition. A hybrid evolutionary computation between the differential evolution and the genetic algorithm is employed for the multidisciplinary design optimization. A self-organizing map is used for the data mining technique in order to extract global design information. Consequently, the design information regarding the tradeoffs among the objective functions, the behaviors of the design variables in the design space to become the nondominated solutions, and the implication of the design variables for the objective functions have been obtained in order to quantitatively differentiate the advantage of hybrid rocket engine in view of the five fuels. Moreover, the next assignments were also revealed.

AB A single-stage launch vehicle with hybrid rocket engine, which uses solid fuel and liquid oxidizer, has been studied and developed as a next-generation rocket for scientific observation due to the advantages as low cost, safety, re-ignition, and reduced pollution. Thereupon, the knowledge regarding hybrid rocket system has been gained through the forepart of the conceptual design using design informatics. In the present study, the practical problem defined by using three objective functions and seven design variables for aurora observation is treated so as to contribute the real world using evolutionary computation and data mining for the field of aerospace engineering. The primary objective of the design in the present study is that the down range and the duration time in the lower thermosphere are sufficiently obtained for the aurora scientific observation, whereas the initial gross weight is held down. Investigated solid fuels are five, while liquid oxidizer is considered as liquid oxygen. A hybrid rocket uses one of five kinds of fuels. The condition of single-time ignition is assumed in flight sequence in order to quantitatively investigate the ascendancy of multi-time ignition. A hybrid evolutionary computation between the differential evolution and the genetic algorithm is employed for the multidisciplinary design optimization. A self-organizing map is used for the data mining technique in order to extract global design information. Consequently, the design information regarding the tradeoffs among the objective functions, the behaviors of the design variables in the design space to become the nondominated solutions, and the implication of the design variables for the objective functions have been obtained in order to quantitatively differentiate the advantage of hybrid rocket engine in view of the five fuels. Moreover, the next assignments were also revealed.

AB Purpose - A new type of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic non-contacting face seals has been designed to meet the requirements of lower leakage, longer life and more repeatedly start and stop on shaft seals raised by liquid rocket engine turbopumps. And an experimental study on the performance of the face seal in the actual liquid oxygen turbopump was completed where low-viscosity water was selected as the seal fluid for the sake of safety. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Different performances of face seals under preset conditions were obtained by repeatedly running tests, and the main performance parameters encompass leakage, fluid film pressure between the faces, operating power, face temperature, and so on.
   Findings - The results indicate that the designed face seal has a smaller amount of leakage, with a minimum value of 3 ml/s. Furthermore, the designed face seal has been proved to demand lower operating power. Since its operating power changes slightly with different sealed fluid pressures, the new seal can be deployed in the harsh working condition with high pressure or with high speed (greater than 20,000 rpm). However, one proviso is that when liquid is employed as the seal fluid, the groove depth should be relatively deeper (greater than 10 mu m).
   Research limitations/implications - In response to future engineering requirements, study on the controllable spiral-groove face seals to improve the current design is being conducted.
   Originality/value - The advancement of such non-contacting face seals proffers important insights to the design of turbo-pump shaft seal in a new generation of liquid rocket engine with regard to the requirement of frequent start and stop as well as long life on it.

AB Purpose - A hybrid bearing of advanced cryogenic rocket engine turbopump is designed. For cryogenic fluid propellants (such as liquid oxygen) as the lubrication of bearing, bearings operating close to liquid-vapor region (near the critical point or slightly sub-cooled) are likely to develop a two phase flow region. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an all liquid, liquid-vapor mixture, and all vapor, i.e. a continuous vaporization bulk flow model of density and viscosity for mixture fluid, is presented, and the general Reynolds equation and energy equation with two phase flow as lubricants is solved. The static and dynamic performance of a 50-mm-radius hybrid bearing are obtained under 20,000 rpm speed and 10 MPa supply pressure.
   Findings - The results show that the variations of performance of bearing operating under cryogenic liquid oxygen are not bounded by the all liquid and all vapor cases in the liquid-vapor mixture range. There behaviours are attributed to the large change in the compressibility character of the flow.
   Research limitations/implications - For validating the correctness of analytical model, an experimental study on the liquid-vapor nitrogen mixture lubricated hybrid journal bearings is being carried out where low-viscosity nitrogen was selected as the lubricant for the sake of safety. Soon after, the authors will discuss the results and publish them in the new papers.
   Originality/value - An all liquid, liquid-vapor mixture, and all vapor, i.e. a continuous vaporization bulk flow model of density and viscosity for mixture fluid, is presented. The static and dynamic performance of hybrid bearings with two phase flow as lubricants are obtained.

AB Vaporization of two liquid oxygen (LOX) droplets in tandem in supercritical convective hydrogen environments has been numerically investigated. The theoretical formulation consists of a complete set of conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species concentrations. The solution technique is based on a unified treatment of general fluid thermodynamics incorporated into a dual time-stepping preconditioning approach. In addition, a self-consistent property evaluation method is implemented to calculate strong property variations in the transcritical and supercritical fluid regimes. The flow conditions cover a range of pressures between 100 and 400 atm and freestream velocities from 2.5 to 20 m/s. Special attention is given to the effect of droplet interaction on the droplet dynamics and vaporization characteristics. Results indicate that the vaporization behaviors of the two interacting droplets are different from those of an isolated droplet. The presence of the trailing droplet has a minor effect on the lifetime and trajectory of the leading droplet. In contrast, the lifetime of the trailing droplet is substantially prolonged and its moving trajectory is strongly altered. At an ambient pressure of 100 atm, a forward bag-type break-up of the leading droplet is observed when the two droplets are placed closely, with the HIR (the initial droplet spacing to the droplet radius) ratio less than 4. Under the same operating conditions, forward movement takes place for the trailing droplet. Increasing ambient pressure weakens droplet interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Considering the complexity of rocket engine geometries, as well as associated fluid flow conditions, the use of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) numerical simulations remains very popular. Important modelling efforts are therefore still required to provide reliable computational models able to describe the complex interaction that takes place between turbulence and chemistry in such cryogenic high-speed flows. The present manuscript reports the results of some recent investigations conducted in this field. The modelling analysis relies on a Lagrangian framework, the salient features of which consist in approximating the Lagrangian path in a reduced composition space made up of the mixture fraction variable, i.e. a conserved scalar introduced to represent the variations of composition, and a progress variable, i.e. a reactive scalar to follow the departures from chemical equilibrium. The retained methodology allows to presume the joint probability density function of the two scalar fields without invoking the assumption of statistical independence between them. Equivalence ratio fluctuations induced by the vaporization of the liquid phase are considered as additional sources terms appearing in the transport equation of the mixture fraction variance. The transport of the corresponding mean scalar dissipation rate (SDR), which is a key quantity in the corresponding closure, is also affected by the vaporization processes. The proposed model has been implemented into the U-RANS CFD code N3S_Natur, while the liquid phase is described using a Lagrangian module. The capabilities of the computation model are evaluated through a detailed comparison with the experimental databases gathered on the ONERA Mascotte test bench. The corresponding test rig consists of a low-speed round jet of liquid oxygen surrounded by an atomizing high-speed co-flowing jet of gaseous-hydrogen. The obtained results confirm that (i) the additional fluctuations induced by the vaporization processes play an important role, (ii) the influence of transient droplet heating on turbulent combustion must be taken into account.

AB Mixing is a key point for thrust and efficiency of combustion systems. It becomes crucial in the case Liquid Rocket Engines as large investments are involved. Besides, the pressure in liquid rocket combustion chamber often exceeding the critical point of loaded propellants, mixing becomes an important scientific issue as fluid properties differ from classical ideal gas assumption. In this study, two configurations are studied to evaluate the impact of subgrid models on mixing. Firstly, Mayer's experiments of trans- and supercritical nitrogen jet injection into a warm nitrogen atmosphere have been numerically investigated with a structured numerical code called SiTCom-B. SiTCom-B solves Direct Numerical Simulations and Large Eddy Simulations equations for perfect or real gas equation of states. In this study, Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and Peng-Robinson equation of state are used with appropriated thermodynamics relations and validated against NIST data. Three-dimensional LES are conducted for two cases (cases 3 and 4 in Mayer et al.'s reference [1]) with real-gas NSCBC treatment. Several sub-grid scale models are tested and the results are compared to experimental data for density on jet axis: a very good agreement is obtained on a light mesh (11.6 million of points) with the SRK equation of state and standard Smagorinsky model. Flow structures are evidenced with Schlieren snapshots. Secondly, the Mascotte test-bench from ONERA is simulated with SiTCom-B based on Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state and Smagorinsky models. The simulated non-reacting case is characterized by a very short liquid oxygen dense core because of the strong density and velocity gradients boosting mixing efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

DE thrust; hybrid rocket; six degrees of freedom
AB A six degree-of-freedom thrust sensor was designed, constructed, calibrated, and tested using the labscale hybrid rocket at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. The system consisted of six independent legs: one parallel to the axis of symmetry of the rocket for main thrust measurement, two vertical legs near the nozzle end of the rocket, one vertical leg near the oxygen input end of the rocket, and two separated horizontal legs near the nozzle end. Each leg was composed of a rotational bearing, a load cell, and a universal joint above and below the load cell. The leg was designed to create point contact along only one direction and minimize the non-axial forces applied to the load cell. With this system, force in each direction and moments for roll, pitch, and yaw can be measured. The system was calibrated and tested using a labscale hybrid rocket using gaseous oxygen and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid fuel. The thrust stand proved to be stable during calibration tests. Thrust force vector components and roll, pitch, and yaw moments were calculated for test firings with an oxygen mass flow rate range of 0.0174-0.0348 kg s(-1).

AB Features such as safety, low-cost, and throttleability make hybrid rocket engines an attractive option for suborbital flights and space exploration missions in general. While the domain of possible liquid oxidizers is well characterized, the choice of a suitable solid fuel is still a matter of investigation. Space Propulsion Laboratory (SPLab) at Politecnico di Milano has developed a series of proprietary techniques to evaluate, on a relative grading, the quality of innovative solid fuels while visualizing at the same time their flame structure. But a serious alert was recently notified that soot emission from hydrocarbon fuels has the potential to contribute to global climate change. In this paper, HTPB polymer has been taken as baseline and characterized at laboratory level in terms of ballistic properties, mechanical testing, and thermochemical calculations. (C) 2012 IAA.

TI Probabilistic Methods to Determine Resonance Risk and Damping for Rocket
   Turbine Blades
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The liquid oxygen-hydrogen J-2X rocket engine, which powers the upper stage of the NASA Space Launch System, is presently undergoing hot-fire testing. Analysis revealed numerous potential resonance issues with hardware in the turbomachinery flowpath, which could be catastrophic for the launch vehicle. This paper describes a series of probabilistic analyses incorporating nondeterministic characteristics of mistuning amplification, blade damping, natural frequency, and speed to assess the risk of failure of turbine blades due to resonance during past and present tests and to determine an appropriate value of damping to use in deterministic forced response analysis. The analyses are the first reported in the literature combining these critical nondeterministic parameters. The new damping determination technique developed here indicates that combining a damping value in the lower 1.5 sigma range with a 3 sigma mistuning amplification value results in a desired total 3 sigma probability of failure. These risk calculations were invaluable for determining high-cycle-fatigue margins of safety and in determining if risk-reduction methods such as dampers were necessary immediately, or if tests could be performed before risk-reduction hardware was ready.

ID TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS; ROCKET NOZZLES; HEAT-TRANSFER; POLAR FLUIDS;
   EQUATIONS; STATE; NONPOLAR
AB The multiple-use plug hybrid for nanosatellites prototype thruster is being developed to fill a niche application for nanosat scale spacecraft propulsion. The prototype thruster uses safe-handling and inexpensive nitrous oxide and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene as propellants. The thruster system provides attitude control using secondary-injection thrust vectoring and allows large-impulse Delta V and small-impulse attitude control and proximity burns to be performed with the same system. To ensure survivability during extended duration burns, the multiple-use plug hybrid for nanosatellites incorporates a novel regenerative cooling design in which the nitrous oxide oxidizer flows through a cooling path embedded in the aerospike nozzle, before being injected into the combustion chamber near the nozzle base. Digital manufacturing was used to fabricate the nozzle components. Fused deposition modeling was used to fabricate the solid fuel grain from the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic. When fully developed, the multiple-use plug hybrid for nanosatellites thruster could provide an enhanced propulsive capability that would enable multiple nanosatellites to be independently repositioned after deployment from the parent launch vehicle. Because the environmentally benign propellants are mixed only within the combustion chamber after ignition, the system is inherently safe and can be piggybacked on a secondary payload with very little overall mission risk increase to the primary payload.

AB The present study attempts to predict the performance of hybrid rocket motors using a physics-based comprehensive model in which all the submodels that govern the various processes that occur during heating and combustion of solid fuel are based on physical-based mathematical models. Based on the fluid-solid coupling technique and some comprehensive physical processes during operation of hybrid rocket motors, a numerical model is developed to predict the regression rate for the solid fuel surface of the hybrid rocket motor under different operation conditions. The muti-dimensional Favre-averaged compressible turbulent Navier-Stokes equations are used as the governing equations of the reacting flow, the two-equation turbulence model is used to simulate the turbulent flow, and the eddy breakup model is used to simulate the gas combustion. The results presented are for hydroxyl-terminated-polybutadiene fuel and gaseous oxygen. The Navier-Stokes model results allow more detailed and realistic observation of the chamber flow field than is permitted by simpler boundary layer analyses. The model predications indicate that fuel surface regression rates are considerably impacted by both the size and geometry of the configuration. This study provides considerable information to the understanding of flow and combustion process in hybrid rocket motors. Methods for optimizing the hybrid combustion characteristic are put forward.

AB The stability and combustion behavior in hybrid rockets are significantly affected by the formation of vortex and their interactions. Previous studies show that the change in the flow conditions prior to entering the fuel grain can also alter behaviors of regression rate and pressure fluctuations. This study focuses on the effect of vorticity interactions on the combustion behaviors by controlling the vortex formation in the pre-chamber. In this regard, an obstacle located in front of mass-injection part was used in both combustion tests and numerical simulations. Experiment study showed that the obstacle location affects on the strength of pressure fluctuation and frequency behaviors. Additionally, numerical calculations with large-eddy simulation (LES) turbulent flow model were done to simulate the evolution of flow interactions including vortex dynamics and pressure oscillations in a cylindrical configuration. It was found that flow structure is changed in that momentum and fluctuation are increased near wall, and an additional layer of vorticity is created due to the obstacle which interacts with near-wall vortices generated by mass blowing. Also, due to mass injection through the wall, a number of positive azimuthal vorticity spots are created that effectively squeeze mainstream flow toward the wall. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB During the last 40 years, the mass of the artificial objects in orbit increased quite steadily at the rate of about 145 metric tons annually, leading to a total tally of approximately 7000 metric tons. Now, most of the cross-sectional area and mass (97% in LEO) is concentrated in about 4600 intact objects, i.e. abandoned spacecraft and rocket bodies, plus a further 1000 operational spacecraft Simulations and parametric analyses have shown that the most efficient and effective way to prevent the outbreak of a long-term exponential growth of the catalogued debris population would be to remove enough cross-sectional area and mass from densely populated orbits. In practice, according to the most recent NASA results, the active yearly removal of approximately 0.1% of the abandoned intact objects would be sufficient to stabilize the catalogued debris in low Earth orbit, together with the worldwide adoption of mitigation measures. The candidate targets for removal would have typical masses between 500 and 1000 kg, in the case of spacecraft, and of more than 1000 kg, in the case of rocket upper stages. Current data suggest that optimal active debris removal missions should be carried out in a few critical altitude-inclination bands. This paper deals with the feasibility study of a mission in which the debris is removed by using a hybrid propulsion module as propulsion unit Specifically, the engine is transferred from a servicing platform to the debris target by a robotic arm so to perform a controlled disposal. Hybrid rocket technology for de-orbiting applications is considered a valuable option due to high specific impulse, intrinsic safety, thrust throttle ability, low environmental impact and reduced operating costs. Typically, in hybrid rockets a gaseous or liquid oxidizer is injected into the combustion chamber along the axial direction to burn a solid fuel. However, the use of tangential injection on a solid grain Pancake Geometry allows for more compact design of the propulsion unit Only explorative tests were performed in the past on this rocket configuration, which appears to be suitable as de-orbiting system of new satellites as well as for direct application on large debris in the framework of a mission for debris removal. The paper describes some critical aspects of the mission with particular concern to the target selection, the hybrid propulsion module, the operations as well as the systems needed to rendezvous and dock with the target, and the disposal strategy.

AB In 2012 we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the first successful rocket launch that reached a height of 84.5 km and had a speed of 4.824 km/h (5x sonic speed). This rocket flew 190 km to the target location. One of the masterminds of this launch was Walter Thiel, a German chemist and rocket engineer. Thiel was highly talented, during his education from primary school until diploma exams he always received a grade of A in his exams. He was called "the student with the 7 A grades". In 1934 Thiel became Dr.-Ing. (chem.), with the highest possible honor (summa cum laude), when he was only 24 years old. He started to work for the rocket development department at Humboldt University, Berlin. Walter Dornberger asked him to leave the university research department and become head of rocket propulsion development in his team in Kummersdorf, near Berlin. Thiel's groundbreaking ideas for the rocket engine would lead to a significant reduction in material, weight and work processes, as well as a shortening in the length of the engine itself. Thiel and his team also defined the fuel itself and the best ratio of mixture between ethanol and liquid oxygen for the engine. In 1940 the propulsion team moved from Kummersdorf to Peenemunde after the launch sites were completed there. Thiel became deputy of Wernher von Braun at the R&D units. One of Thiel's team members was Konrad Dannenberg, who later became famous in the development of the Saturn program. On the night from August 17 to August 18, 1943, Thiel and his family (wife and two children) were killed during a Royal Air Force bombing raid (Operation Hydra). The Moon crater "Thiel" on the far side of the Moon is named after Walter Thiel. The research results of Walter Thiel had a strong impact on the United States' rocket program as well as the Russian rocket development program. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID HYDROGEN
AB An experimental performance evaluation of metal hydride fuel additives for hybrid rocket motor propulsion systems is examined in this paper. Some metal hydride additives offer improved performance, but a common issue is material aging.. An accelerated aging study revealed that dicyclopentadiene can protect sodium borohydride (Na BH4) particles from exposure to air and water vapor much better than conventional hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. Static hybrid rocket motor experiments were conducted using dicyclopentadiene as the fuel. Sodium borohydride and aluminum hydride (AIH(3)) were examined as fuel additives. Ninety percent rocket-grade hydrogen peroxide was used as the oxidizer. In this paper, the sensitivity of solid fuel regression rate and characteristic velocity efficiency to total fuel grain port mass flux and particle loading is examined. Chamber pressure histories revealed steady motor operation in most tests, with reduced ignition delays when using the Na BH4 fuel additive. The addition of Na BH4 and AIH(3) produces up to a 47 and 85% increase in regression rate over neat dicyclopentadiene, respectively. For all test conditions examined characteristic velocity efficiency ranges between 80 and 90%. The regression rate and characteristic velocity efficiency mass flux dependence indicate a shift toward a more diffusion controlled system with metal hydride particle addition.

AB This study has investigated numerically turbulent flames of cryogenic oxygen and methane under supercritical pressures relevant to liquid propellant rocket engines. A real-fluid version of the flamelet equations is employed to accommodate simultaneously non-equilibrium chemistry of hydrocarbon fuel and non-ideal thermodynamics in local flame structures while the effect of turbulent fluctuations is accounted for via a presumed probability density functions. The present model reproduced qualitatively well the experimentally observed unique feature of a transcritical flame of coaxial gaseous methane/liquid oxygen injector, which is characterized by sudden flame expansion, abruptly terminated flame tip, and expansion induced flow recirculation. Numerical results reveal that pseudo-boiling phenomena occurred in the transcritical mixing layer between the cryogenic oxygen core and the surrounding hot gas play a crucial role in mixing and combustion processes. It is also found that the transcritical flame structure is drastically affected by elevating the chamber pressure or increasing the oxygen inlet temperature in terms of flame length, sudden expansion angle, and reverse flow strength. Detailed discussions are made for effects of the real-fluid behaviors on the turbulent flame field as well as on the local flame structure in mixture fraction space. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB An experimental study was conducted to understand the combustion behavior of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/boron-based solid fuels for future hybrid rocket motor applications. Fuels were loaded with 10-40% boron powder (w/w). Two different types of PTFE were examined in this study, while a single type of boron powder was considered. No significant differences in the decomposition mechanisms for PTFE and a candidate solid fuel mixture were observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-jump (T-jump)/Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments. Diffusion flame studies between solid fuels and gaseous oxygen were carried out to measure regression rates and to develop a fundamental understanding of the combustion behavior. The fuels with the lowest boron content readily extinguished upon removal of the supplemental oxygen flow. The fuels with the highest loadings of boron self-propagated after ignition. X-ray diffraction on postcombustion residue of the self-propagating material revealed graphite and boron carbide as the remaining products, while particles captured leaving the surface of the fuel under normal burning conditions were found to be mostly boric acid. Boron oxidation and magnesium fluorination were observed in the flame zone of the diffusion flame by UV-Vis emission spectroscopy (magnesium is the major impurity in the elemental boron powder used). The results of this study suggest that solid fuels comprising PTFE and boron show promise for improving the energy density of hybrid rockets.

AB Liquefied natural gas is a suitable propellant to be used, together with liquid oxygen as oxidizer, in a liquid rocket engine, because of possible advantages with respect to hydrogen in specific applications. Often approximated as pure methane, liquefied natural gas is a mixture of methane, other heavier hydrocarbons and nitrogen. If is to be used in a regeneratively cooled liquid rocket engine, the knowledge of the thermodynamic and heat transfer characteristics when it flows in the cooling channels is of primary importance. The present study is carried out to understand how the composition can influence the flow in cooling channels. Results show that increasing ethane and propane content in a mixture, the pressure drop decreases but the coolant capability worsens. On the other hand increasing nitrogen content causes both poorer coolant capability and larger pressure drop.

ID DETONATION
AB An engineering risk assessment of the conditions for massive explosions of cryogenic liquid hydrogen-oxygen rockets during launch accidents is presented. The assessment is based on the analysis of the data of purposeful rupture experiments with liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks and on an interpretation of these data via analytical semiquantitative estimates and numerical simulations of simplified models for the whole range of the physical phenomena governing the outcome of a propellant-tank breach. The following sequence of events is reconstructed: rupture of fuel tanks, escape of the fluids from the ruptured tanks, liquid film boiling, fragmentation of liquid flow, formation of aerosol oxygen and hydrogen clouds, mixing of the clouds, droplet evaporation, self-ignition of the aerosol clouds, and aerosol combustion. The power of the explosion is determined by a small fraction of the escaped cryogens that become well mixed within the aerosol cloud during the delay time between rupture and ignition. Several scenarios of cavitation-induced self-ignition of the cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen mixture are discussed. The explosion parameters in a particular accident are expected to be highly varied and unpredictable due to randomness of the processes of formation, mixing, and ignition of oxygen and hydrogen clouds. Under certain conditions rocket accidents may result in very strong explosions with blast pressures from a few atm up to 100 atm. The most dangerous situations and the foreseeable risks for space missions are uncovered.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper presents three-dimensional numerical simulations of the hybrid rocket motor with hydrogen peroxide (HP) and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) propellant combination and investigates the fuel regression rate distribution characteristics of different fuel types. The numerical models are established to couple the Navier-Stokes equations with turbulence, chemical reactions, solid fuel pyrolysis and solid-gas interfacial boundary conditions. Simulation results including the temperature contours and fuel regression rate distributions are presented for the tube, star and wagon wheel grains. The results demonstrate that the changing trends of the regression rate along the axis are similar for all kinds of fuel types, which decrease sharply near the leading edges of the fuels and then gradually increase with increasing axial locations. The regression rates of the star and wagon wheel grains show apparent three-dimensional characteristics, and they are higher in the regions of fuel surfaces near the central core oxidizer flow. The average regression rates increase as the oxidizer mass fluxes rise for all of the fuel types. However, under same oxidizer mass flux, the average regression rates of the star and wagon wheel grains are much larger than that of the tube grain due to their lower hydraulic diameters.

AB Aggregates of aluminum nanoparticles are good solid fuel due to high flame propagation rates. Multi-million atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism underlying higher reaction rate in a chain of aluminum nanoparticles as compared to an isolated nanoparticle. This is due to the penetration of hot atoms from reacting nanoparticles to an adjacent, unreacted nanoparticle, which brings in external heat and initiates exothermic oxidation reactions. The calculated speed of penetration is 54 m/s, which is within the range of experimentally measured flame propagation rates. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB The inert and oxidative flash pyrolysis of high density poly-ethylene (HDPE) is studied up to 20,000 K/s, under pressure up to 3.0 MPa and at temperature ranging from 1000 K to 1500 K. These conditions are considered to represent those waited onboard a hybrid rocket engine using HDPE as solid fuel. Recycling applications may also find some interest. The pyrolysis products are quantified by Gas Chromatograph, Flame Ionisation Detector and Mass Spectrometer to determine the effects of each physical parameter on the HDPE decomposition. The classical products distribution diene-alkene-alkane for each carbon atoms number is shown to be modified at such high temperature because of the pyrolysis of primary products. The pressure effect, which is generally neglected in HDPE pyrolysis studies found in open literature, is proved to be a major factor (up to one order of magnitude on the ethylene mass fraction). The heating rate presents noticeable consequences on the pyrolysis products distribution with a larger formation of light species while heavier ones are favoured under oxidative pyrolysis conditions. The experimental data should serve in the future to improve the accuracy of kinetic mechanisms for later use in numerical computing and to serve in related combustion studies for propulsive applications.

AB High frequency combustion instabilities have plagued the development of liquid propellant rocket engines since their invention. Continuing research efforts aim to understand the mechanisms by which the oscillating combustion chamber pressure of self-sustaining combustion instabilities is driven. To this end, a rectangular combustor with acoustic forcing, designated 'BKH', was developed to study flame-acoustic interaction under conditions which are representative of real rocket engines. This article describes the acoustic characterisation of the BKH combustor using high frequency dynamic pressure measurements from the first hot-fire tests using liquid oxygen and ambient temperature or cryogenic hydrogen injectants. Analysis of the resulting high frequency pressure measurements shows excellent agreement with the predicted acoustic properties of the system which were calculated using finite element methods.

AB Hybrid rocket combustion has important effects on rocket performance. The solid fuel regression rate is an important quantity in the hybrid rocket operation. In the past years, experimental and analytical investigations have been conducted to find correlations to correctly predict the regression rate. Numerical computations are becoming more important in the estimation of the characteristic parameters of such a complex combustion that embraces many different phenomena. This study predicts the regression rate of the Hydroxyl-Terminated Poly-Butadiene/Gaseous Oxygen formulation and its sensitivities to some operating parameters, such as combustion chamber pressure, oxygen inlet temperature, and mass flow rate. Furthermore, an analysis of other variables is used to explain the experimentally observed regression rate behavior. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of the oxygen between the flame and the surface, which is considered responsible for the pyrolysis process enhancement.

AB Aluminum (Al) is an attractive solid fuel for rocket propulsion and energy conversion systems due to its large volumetric energy density, earth abundance, and low cost. Nonintrusive optical flash ignition is attractive for many applications due to its simplicity and flexibility in controlling the area exposed to the flash. However, flash ignition of Al microparticles (MPs) is challenging due to their higher minimum flash ignition energy, which originates from weaker light absorption and higher ignition temperature compared to Al nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, the minimum flash ignition energy of Al MPs is reduced by the addition of WO3 NPs. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4790152]

DE Hybrid rocket motor; Scale effect; Regression rate
AB The scale effect of solid fuel regression rate in hybrid rocket motors is investigated theoretically based on pipe turbulent boundary combustion theory firstly, and a practicable scaling criterion of solid fuel regression rate has been obtained. The criterion indicates that solid fuel regression rate decreases with fuel port diameter and is proportional to d(-0.2) when convective heat transfer is dominant in hybrid rocket motor. Based on the criterion, a numerical model combined with turbulence, combustion, solid fuel pyrolysis and solid-gas coupling model was established to simulate three different size motors, and an analysis was also performed on experimental data of different motors. Both the numerical results and experimental data verified the scaling criterion of solid fuel regression rate under different fuel port sizes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

DE Combustion; Transverse acoustic modulations
ID BEHAVIOR
AB The present investigation is focused on high-frequency combustion instabilities coupled by transverse acoustic modes. This phenomenon has been observed during the development of many liquid rocket engines and other high performance devices. Such instabilities induce an unsteady heat release which leads in many cases to a rapid intensification of heat fluxes to the thrust chamber walls, causing fatal damage and a spectacular destruction of the propulsion system. One central objective of this effort is to observe and understand the physical processes leading the coupling between acoustics and combustion, and resulting in the growth of such instabilities. Experiments carried out on the Mascotte testbed at ONERA serve to identify the main processes involved and bring forth mechanisms taking place when an engine becomes unstable. Hot fire experiments are carried out in a model scale combustor reproducing many of the conditions prevailing in unstable rocket engines. Subcritical and transcritical cryogenic jets are injected in a multiple injector combustion chamber (MIC). This system is fed with LOx and methane through five injection units. The flames formed in this configuration are modulated by an acoustic wave with an amplitude of several bars. This is obtained with a new Very Large Amplitude Modulator (VHAM) capable of generating acoustic mode amplitudes representative of those found in actual engine undergoing HF instabilities. It is shown first that the strength of the acoustic field and the frequency range of oscillation (1 kHz-3.5 kHz) are consistent with rocket instability observations. Conditions where a feedback of the flame on the acoustic field occurs are obtained. High speed diagnostics indicates that the velocity field dramatically enhances the atomization process. The liquid core length is strongly reduced. At moderate amplitudes, the liquid jets are flattened in the spanwise direction and heat release takes place in two sheets neighboring the dense core of oxygen. At higher amplitudes the core size is diminished and the flame pattern is considerably more compact. It is also shown that the flames are periodically displaced by the acoustic field and an alternate pattern of liquid oxygen appears in the chamber. An oscillation of the oxygen distribution in the transverse direction of the chamber is observed. (C) 2012 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID CLEARANCE
AB This article describes a series of development tests of a turbopump, which can be applied to a gas generator cycle rocket engine with liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants. A turbine drives both an oxidizer pump and a fuel pump in the turbopump assembly. In the tests, liquid oxygen and kerosene are supplied to the oxidizer pump and the fuel pump, respectively, while either cold hydrogen gas or hot gas from the gas generator is supplied to the turbine. The turbopump is operated reliably at both on-design and off-design conditions, meeting all the performance requirements. The test results are compared with those of the turbopump component tests, where model fluids are used, that is, water for the oxidizer pump and the fuel pump, and cold air for the turbine. The turbopump tests results agree well with the turbopump component test results. The speed buildup of the turbopump at start period is calculated when pressurized gas is used to initially spin the turbine. A differential equation which represents the torque balance between the turbine and the pumps is solved. The calculation shows a good agreement with the test result. When the mechanical loss of the turbopump is considered, a better estimation is obtained.

DT Article
ID TERMINATED POLYBUTADIENE HTPB; FLASH PYROLYSIS; COMBUSTION
AB The regression rate of the solid fuel is a primary parameter in the performance analysis for a hybrid rocket. Many studies in the past few years have theoretically claimed, or experimentally shown, a dependence of the regression rate on the chamber total pressure. Such behavior is generally traced back to the presence of oxygen below the flame zone and of heterogeneous reactions occurring at the surface and affecting the pyrolysis law. An experimental program was performed at the Space Propulsion Laboratory of the Politecnico di Milano showing, within the explored operating conditions and the associated uncertainty bands, a neutral trend for the solid fuel regression rate with increasing pressure. The formulation tested was hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene in gaseous oxygen at pressures ranging from 4 to 16 bar. A simplified analytical model, which retains the essential physics and accounts for pressure dependency, has been developed, together with the corresponding numerical simulation. The results of the proposed model are presented here. The experimental results are input to the developed model, to obtain a semi-empirical pyrolysis rate law that helps to describe a possible pressure dependency.

ID REGRESSION RATE
AB A series of paraffin-based hybrid rocket fuel has been studied experimentally in a laboratory-scale motor. To enhance the regression rate of paraffin solid fuel, three types of grain configurations: Cylindrical, star, and helical grain configurations of paraffin wax have been developed and tested with gaseous oxygen. The helical fuel grain presented best performance among all the test ports. About 40.2 per cent and 20.6 per cent regression rates are increased by burning paraffin fuel with helical and star grain configuration respectively, as compared to cylindrical grain configuration at G(ox)=0.0191 g/min(2)s. The regression rates were significantly influenced by the oxygen injection pressure varied between 344.7 kPa and 620.5 kPa. Furthermore, the experimentally obtained exponents of oxidizer mass flux for all three grain configurations have been found to be significantly different from those of the classical hybrid system. Finally, thrust-time traces for all three grain configurations were also studied. The result shown no significant increase or decrease in the amplitude of the thrust oscillations.

AB High Density PolyEthylene (HDPE) is one of the possible solid fuels to be used in hybrid rocket propulsion, despite its low ability of rapidly producing combustible gas. This drawback may be balanced by the auto-ignition delay of the pyrolysis products, which would conduct to the increase of the heat release rate in the engine and thus to the one of the regression rate. Six single and multi-steps HDPE pyrolysis mechanisms from the literature are compared in this paper to determine their ability to predict the production of by-products and the consumption of HOPE. Transient pyrolysis is observed from 650 K to 823 K at atmospheric pressure and discrepancies up to a factor 7 are found between these mechanisms, despite they are all derived from experimental data. One mechanism is finally selected to conduct a parametric study in more realistic operating conditions for hybrid rocket, up to 1700 K and 100 bar. Identifying and quantifying pyrolysis products are necessary to study their combustion with another detailed mechanism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Genetic Algorithm
AB The multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is applied to the multi-disciplinary conceptual design problem for a three-stage launch vehicle (LV) with a hybrid rocket engine (HRE). MOGA is an optimization tool used for multi-objective problems. The parallel coordinate plot (PCP), which is a data mining method, is employed in the post-process in MOGA for design knowledge discovery. A rocket that can deliver observing micro-satellites to the sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) is designed. It consists of an oxidizer tank containing liquid oxidizer, a combustion chamber containing solid fuel, a pressurizing tank and a nozzle. The objective functions considered in this study are to minimize the total mass of the rocket and to maximize the ratio of the payload mass to the total mass. To calculate the thrust and the engine size, the regression rate is estimated based on an empirical model for a paraffin (FT-0070) propellant. Several non-dominated solutions are obtained using MOGA, and design knowledge is discovered for the present hybrid rocket design problem using a PCP analysis. As a result, substantial knowledge on the design of an LV with an HRE is obtained for use in space transportation.

AB This work presents a study of non-premixed flames at supercritical-pressure conditions. Emphasis is placed on flame stability in liquid rocket engines fueled with liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen. The flame structure sensitivity to strain, pressure, temperature and real-fluid effects was investigated in detailed opposed-jet flames calculations. It is shown that the flame is very robust to strain, that the flamelet assumption is valid for the conditions of interest, and that real-fluid phenomena can have a significant impact on flame topology. At high-pressure supercritical conditions, small pressure or temperature variations can induce strong changes of thermodynamic properties across the flame. A substantial finding was also that the presence of water from combustion significantly increases the critical pressure of the mixture, but this does not lead to a saturated state where two-phase flow may be observed. The present study then shows that a single-phase real-fluid approach is relevant for supercritical hydrogen-oxygen combustion. Resultant observations are used to develop a flamelet model framework that combines detailed real-fluid thermodynamics with a tabulated chemistry approach. The governing equation for energy contains a compressible source term that models the flame. Through this approach, the solver is capable of capturing compressibility and strain-rate effects. Good agreements have been obtained with respect to detailed computations. Heat release sensitivity to strain and pressure variations is also recovered. Consequently, this approach can be used to study combustion stability in actual burners. The approach preserves the density gradient in the high-shear region between the liquid-oxygen jet and product rich flame region. The latter is a key requirement to properly simulate dense-fluid jet destabilization and mixing in practical devices. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID CAVITIES
AB Cryogenic fluids such as liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and liquid methane have often been used as liquid rocket propellants, and it is well known that the suction performance of turbopump inducers is better in cryogenic fluids than it is in cold water due to the so-called "thermodynamic effect." The origin of the thermodynamic effect is the temperature change inside a cavity region that arises from the latent heat transfer across the interface of a cavity. To better understand the suction performance of cavitating cryogenic inducers, we must take into account the temperature changes that take place due to the thermodynamic effect; computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis coupled with an energy equation is one of the most powerful tools for this purpose. The computational cost, however, becomes an obstacle for its application to the design phase, so a reduction in the number of governing equations is often preferable. In the present study, a cryogenic cavitation model that does not need to solve an energy equation is proposed as a reduced model; the model is named the "reduced critical radius model." This model assumes that the temperature change due to the latent heat transfer can be analytically well estimated on the basis of an approximation of the local equilibrium when the pressure inside a cavity is always kept at a saturation vapor pressure at every temperature (at least on the time scale of the flow field). The proposed method was validated carefully for a variety of objects: blunt headforms, hydrofoils, a two-dimensional blunt wing, and Laval nozzles. The results obtained during the validation were in good agreement with the experimental results, except in the case of strong unsteady cavitation. This indicates that the present method, which does not involve solving an energy equation, offers good potential for application to the design phase of cryogenic cavitating inducers.

AB It is very important to be able to predict material behaviors at low and high temperatures for the design and manufacturing of reliable elevated-temperature systems. Superalloys are widely used on most liquid rocket engines for space launch vehicles or gas turbine engines where they experience hot temperature gases and low temperature fluids like liquid oxygen. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is one of the manufacturing methods for developing these materials. In this research, three superalloys, HIP Inconel 718, HIP Rene 95, and HIP Astroloy, were investigated at elevated temperatures. Serrated flow induced by dynamic strain aging (DSA) was observed in certain temperature regions where the embrittlement of the materials progressed. A dislocation barrier model was modified to describe the material behavior including dynamic strain aging and creep relaxation effects observed at high temperatures. The suggested model was found to predict well the deformation behaviors of the superalloys from low temperatures to elevated temperatures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Spray-on foam insulations for launch vehicle cryogenic tanks
SO CRYOGENICS

DT Article
DE Foam insulation; Cryogenic tanks; Thermal conductivity; Environmental
   exposures; Space launch
AB Spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) has been developed for use on the cryogenic tanks of space launch vehicles beginning in the 1960s with the Apollo program. The use of SOFI was further developed for the Space Shuttle program. The External Tank (ET) of the Space Shuttle, consisting of a forward liquid oxygen tank in line with an aft liquid hydrogen tank, requires thermal insulation over its outer surface to prevent ice formation and avoid in-flight damage to the ceramic tile thermal protection system on the adjacent Orbiter. The insulation also provides system control and stability throughout the lengthy process of cooldown, loading, and replenishing the tank. There are two main types of SOFI used on the ET: acreage (with the rind) and closeout (machined surface). The thermal performance of the seemingly simple SOFI system is a complex array of many variables starting with the large temperature difference of 200-260 K through the typical 25-mm thickness. Environmental factors include air temperature and humidity, wind speed, solar exposure, and aging or weathering history. Additional factors include manufacturing details, launch processing operations, and number of cryogenic thermal cycles. The study of the cryogenic thermal performance of SOFI under large temperature differentials is the subject of this article. The amount of moisture taken into the foam during the cold soak phase, termed Cryogenic Moisture Uptake, must also be considered. The heat leakage rates through these foams were measured under representative conditions using laboratory standard liquid nitrogen boiloff apparatus. Test articles included baseline, aged, and weathered specimens. Testing was performed over the entire pressure range from high vacuum to ambient pressure. Values for apparent thermal conductivity and heat flux were calculated and compared with prior data. As the prior data of record was obtained for small temperature differentials on non-weathered foams, analysis of the different methods is provided. Recent advancements and applications of SOFI systems on future launch vehicles and spacecraft are also addressed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Cryogenic densification
AB Among the many factors that determine overall rocket performance, propellant density is important because it affects the size of the rocket. Thus, in order to decrease the size of a rocket, it may be desirable to increase the density of propellants. This study analyzes the concept of increasing the propellant density by employing a cooling source submerged in the liquid propellant. A simple, mathematical model was developed to predict the rate of densification and the propellant temperature profile. The mathematical model is generic and applicable to multiple propellants. The densification rate was determined experimentally by submerging a cooling source in liquid oxygen at constant positive pressure, and measuring the time rate of change in temperature with respect to vertical position. The results from the mathematical model provided a reasonable fit compared to experimental results. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The numerical simulation of the liquid film in a liquid oxygen/rocket propellant 1 (LOx/RP - 1) liquid rocket was conducted using time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the standard k-epsilon model for compressible steady three-dimensional flow. The RP-1 combustion kinetics mechanism of 10 components and 17 step reactions was used in the eddy-dissipation-concept model. The results show that the film-cooling effectiveness is higher with the greater mass flow rate of the RP-1 film and that adding the radial angle of the film hole is helpful for enhancing the film-cooling effectiveness at the beginning of the combustor chamber. To achieve lower carbon deposition at the throat of the nozzle and higher cooling effectiveness, RP-1 film mixed with 5-10% H-2 or H2O is proposed as a new type of cooling film in this paper. After 10% H-2 or 10% H2O is added to the RP-1 film, the film-cooling effectiveness is improved by 20.3% or 11.8%, respectively. Moreover, the liquid film decreases the nozzle-specific impulse by no more than 2.33%.

AB Piloted ignition of solid fuels in dump combustor geometry subject to an igniter hot jet plume is numerically investigated. The objective of this work is to gain insight into the fuel ignition and subsequent flame spreading in this turbulent flow configuration. Conjugate heat transfer between gas and solid phases is considered to study the solid fuel heating and evaporation process; Solid phase energy equation is simultaneously solved coupled with flow governing equations. Finite rate one step second order chemistry is used in simulations. The gas phase equations along with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model are solved with a finite volume approach in which the AUSM(+) scheme is used to calculate the convective fluxes. The overall ignition delay time and flame spreading rate are predicted under a typical igniter operation. The results show that choosing a stronger igniter for reducing the ignition delay time does not necessarily guaranty the perfect firing process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID PROPELLANT ROCKET
AB The transient thermal behavior in the cryogenic oxidizer tank for the liquid propulsion system of the KSLV-I satellite launching space vehicle is theoretically investigated for the pressurization process by gaseous helium injection followed by the readiness check stage. The numerical model is established using the transient mass and energy conservation of oxygen/helium mixtures both in ullage and liquid regions. At the liquid-gas interface, various modes of heat and mass transfer are considered, including the liquid evaporation and the helium absorption. The present study focuses on the effects of the increasing pressurization level on some of important properties that should be considered in the propulsion system design, such as tank pressure, ullage gas temperature, and evaporation of liquid oxygen. Particularly, the tank pressure drop after the pressurization is investigated in the proposed design of propulsion system. Also, the effect of the initial loading of liquid oxygen in the oxidizer tank is studied and discussed. As for the helium absorption into the liquid region, its mass is negligibly small and it should not be the concern in design and operation of the oxidizer tank system.

AB Based on a generalized cubic equation of state proposed by Cismondi and Mollerup [Fluid Phase Equilib. 232 (2005) 74-89], this study derived formulations for the thermodynamic properties of mixtures that are needed for combustion simulations of liquid rocket engines. The present model was validated thoroughly against reference data provided by NIST in order to assess its validity over a wide range of critical compressibility factors, pressures, and temperatures. The numerical results clearly indicate that the present model is superior in its handling of fluid mixtures with quite different critical compressibility factors, while maintaining the advantages of the cubic equation of state compared to those of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of state. In addition, steady flamelet analysis has been performed to investigate the effects of detailed chemical kinetics, real fluid behavior, and increased pressure on the local flame structures of the kerosene surrogate and liquid oxygen relevant to liquid rocket engines.

AB An experimental study on the effects of an applied external electric field on the combustion behavior of solid fuels and solid propellants has been conducted. In an opposed flow burning configuration, application of an electric field was shown to extinguish a paraffin fuel and gaseous oxygen flame over a broad range of operating conditions. When subjected to the electric field, burning paraffin fuel strands were found to extinguish at various axial locations relative to the exit of the oxidizer gas jet. Extinguishment location was found to be a function of field strength as well as electrode surface area, while changes in polarity did not significantly alter the results. In addition, the combustion behaviors of two composite solid rocket propellants were studied while subjected to an external electric field. Both propellants were based on HTPB/AP combinations, with one propellant containing aluminum and the other being non-aluminized. Application of an electric field to the composite solid rocket propellant strands demonstrated decreases in propellant burning rate under all operating conditions for both propellants including changes in polarity. The flame structure of the aluminized propellant was examined closely as the luminosity, flame length, and flame width varied significantly with field strength and burning location of the strand relative to the electrodes.

AB An experimental study has been performed to investigate the effects of the recess length on the discharge coefficients of swirl coaxial injectors. Liquid oxygen and kerosene (Jet A-1) were burned in a range of mixture ratios (1.97-3.31) and chamber pressures (43-80 bar) in small liquid rocket thrust chambers. Each thrust chamber was equipped with 19 liquid-liquid swirl coaxial injectors. While changing the recess length of the injectors, static pressure, temperature, and flow rate data were collected and analyzed to calculate the discharge coefficient. The discharge coefficients obtained from hot-firing tests are compared with those from cold-flow tests. Operating conditions such as oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratio and chamber pressure have some influence on the discharge coefficients. The recess length of the injectors significantly affects the discharge coefficients in the hot-firing tests, but not in the cold-flow tests. The results show that the longer recess length gradually reduces the discharge coefficients. Especially when the liquid oxygen film collides with the kerosene film inside the fuel nozzle, the discharge coefficients of the outer fuel-side injectors decrease more remarkably than those of the inner oxidizer-side. It is thought that the flame anchored inside the recessed region in the swirl coaxial injector confines propellant flows, and the internal mixing of propellants strongly disturbs the outer fuel flow. Since the discharge coefficient is directly related to the injection pressure drop, the effects of recess length on discharge coefficients must be carefully considered when designing liquid-liquid swirl coaxial injectors.

TI Recent Experimental Efforts on High-Pressure Supercritical Injection for
   Liquid Rockets and Their Implications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Review
AB Pressure and temperature of the liquid rocket thrust chambers into which propellants are injected have been in an ascending trajectory to gain higher specific impulse. It is quite possible then that the thermodynamic condition into which liquid propellants are injected reaches or surpasses the critical point of one or more of the injected fluids. For example, in cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen liquid rocket engines, such as Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) or Vulcain (Ariane 5), the injected liquid oxygen finds itself in a supercritical condition. Very little detailed information was available on the behavior of liquid jets under such a harsh environment nearly two decades ago. The author had the opportunity to be intimately involved in the evolutionary understanding of injection processes at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), spanning sub-to supercritical conditions during this period. The information included here attempts to present a coherent summary of experimental achievements pertinent to liquid rockets, focusing only on the injection of nonreacting cryogenic liquids into a high-pressure environment surpassing the critical point of at least one of the propellants. Moreover, some implications of the results acquired under such an environment are offered in the context of the liquid rocket combustion instability problem.

TI Testing and Modeling Fuel Regression Rate in a Miniature Hybrid Burner
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB Ballistic characterization of an extended group of innovative HTPB-based solid fuel formulations for hybrid rocket propulsion was performed in a lab-scale burner. An optical time-resolved technique was used to assess the quasisteady regression history of single perforation, cylindrical samples. The effects of metalized additives and radiant heat transfer on the regression rate of such formulations were assessed. Under the investigated operating conditions and based on phenomenological models from the literature, analyses of the collected experimental data show an appreciable influence of the radiant heat flux from burnt gases and soot for both unloaded and loaded fuel formulations. Pure HTPB regression rate data are satisfactorily reproduced, while the impressive initial regression rates of metalized formulations require further assessment.

AB This paper presents the design of a hybrid rocket motor and the experiments carried out for investigation of hybrid combustion and regression rates for a combination of liquid oxidiser red fuming nitric acid with solid fuel hydroxyl-terminated Polybutadiene. The regression rate is enhanced with the addition of small quantity of solid oxidiser ammonium perchlorate in the fuel. The characteristics of the combustion products were calculated using the NASA CEA Code and were used in a ballistic code developed for predicting the performance of the hybrid rocket motor. A lab-scale motor was designed and the oxidiser mass flow requirements of the hybrid motor for the above combination of fuel and oxidiser have been calculated using the developed ballistic code. A static rocket motor testing facility has been realised for conducting the hybrid experiments. A series of tests were conducted and proper ignition with stable combustion in the hybrid mode has been established. The regression rate correlations were obtained as a function of the oxidiser mass flux and chamber pressure from the experiments for the various combinations.

DE Fluid-structure interaction; Liquid oxygen; Finite volume method
AB The fluid-structure interaction may occur in space launch vehicles, which would lead to bad performance of vehicles, damage equipments on vehicles, or even affect astronauts' health. In this paper, analysis on dynamic behavior of liquid oxygen (LOX) feeding pipe system in a large scale launch vehicle is performed, with the effect of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) taken into consideration. The pipe system is simplified as a planar FSI model with Poisson coupling and junction coupling. Numerical tests on pipes between the tank and the pump are solved by the finite volume method. Results show that restrictions weaken the interaction between axial and lateral vibrations. The reasonable results regarding frequencies and modes indicate that the FSI affects substantially the dynamic analysis, and thus highlight the usefulness of the proposed model. This study would provide a reference to the pipe test, as well as facilitate further studies on oscillation suppression.

AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the pressure wave propagation behavior in LOX/kerosene rocket engine pump pipeline. A pressure wave propagation model for gas-liquid two-phase flow with phase change taken into consideration is first proposed by using ensemble-averaging techniques. Then condensation of gas oxygen in subcooled liquid oxygen and the corresponding mixing process in pump pipeline are numerically simulated with the application of thermal phase change model in Computational Fluid Dynamics code CFX. Finally, based on the established model and the predicted flow parameters, pressure wave in gas-liquid pipeline flow, characterized by the propagation speed and the attenuation coefficient, is studied by personally compiled code on MATLAB. The calculation results indicate that the propagation speed of two-phase pressure wave first slightly falls and then increases with the decreasing void fraction along the flow direction, and the increase of angular frequency causes the propagation speed and the attenuation coefficient of two-phase pressure wave to increase. The vapor bubble diameter, mass flow rate and inlet temperature of gas oxygen are shown to have strong effects on the mixing flow condensation process of gas oxygen and liquid oxygen. Bubble with larger diameter can weaken the condensation process, and leads to greater cross-sectional mean void fraction of gas oxygen. This phenomenon results in an overall decrease in pressure wave propagation speed and an increase in attenuation coefficient except for the short slug-flow region located at the pipeline inlet. Similar effects can also be achieved by increasing the mass flow rate or the inlet temperature of gas oxygen. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The primary goal of this study is to numerically model the transcritical mixing and reacting flow processes encountered in liquid propellant rocket engines. In order to realistically represent turbulence-chemistry interactions, detailed chemical kinetics, and non-ideal thermodynamic behaviors related to the liquid rocket combustion at supercritical pressures, the flamelet approach is coupled with real-fluid modeling based on the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state. To validate the real-fluid flamelet model, a gaseous hydrogen/cryogenic liquid oxygen coaxial jet flame at supercritical pressure has been chosen as a benchmark case. Numerical results are compared with experimental data obtained for the OH radical and the temperature distribution. It was found that weak flow recirculation is induced by the sudden expansion of cold core cryogenic oxygen associated with the pseudo-boiling process. This weak recirculation zone substantially influences the fundamental characteristics of liquid propellant reacting flows at supercritical pressures in terms of the spreading and the flame length. For the flame conditions employed in this study, the predicted contours of the OH radical are in good agreement with the experimental Abel transformed emission image in terms of the flame spreading angle and the flame location. Numerical results suggest that the real-fluid based flamelet model is capable of realistically predicting the overall characteristics of a turbulent non-premixed GH(2)/LOx flame at supercritical pressures.

AB A code for the numerical simulation of combustion processes in hybrid rockets, developed at the Space Propulsion Laboratory of Politecnico di Milano (SPLab), is presented. The code deals with Navier-Stokes equations solved with RANS approach, blowing effect, combustion kinetics and radiation. The equations are closed with k-epsilon turbulence model and well stirred reactor model. The P1 model, a simplification of the PN radiation model, is adopted. Specific simulation tools were developed using OpenFOAM (R) open source technology. The computational domain is 2D and split in two subdomains, simulating the reacting gas mixture on one side and the solid fuel grain on the other. The interface between the two regions plays a key role as the solid grain pyrolysis comes from a straight solution of the model without shortcuts. A propellant combination with polybutadiene and gaseous oxygen has been chosen and a reduced kinetic model for combustion of butadiene, considered as the major gaseous constituent coming from polybutadiene pyrolysis, has been developed for reactions occurring in oxygen atmosphere. The computational domain tries to replicate the real experimental setup and is split into three areas: pre-chamber, slab zone and post-chamber. High speed camera visualizations of the combustion processes allow to compare the flame height, obtained by the code and by experimental tests, along the grain for given boundary conditions.

DT Article
AB A series of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computations are made for a range of conditions pertinent to coaxial rocket injectors used on large liquid rocket engines with the intent of investigating unsteadiness resulting from hydrodynamic instabilities within the confines of the injector and in the near field of the injection point in the chamber. Axisymmetric simulations are conducted using a real fluid treatment for liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen propellants. An in-depth look inside the injector recess region was performed in an effort to characterize the dynamic character of mass flow pulsations created from hydrodynamic instabilities. Wake instabilities downstream of the liquid oxygen post tip, the acoustic pulsations within the liquid oxygen tube, and the vortex shedding from the injector lip all contribute to natural pulsations, even in the event of purely steady upstream and downstream conditions. The effects of varying the oxidizer/fuel ratio, the liquid oxygen post thickness, the liquid oxygen post length, and the liquid oxygen post acoustic frequency on injector frequency response were investigated.

TI Fuel-Rich Combustion Characteristics of Biswirl Coaxial Injectors
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB An experimental study was performed to investigate the combustion characteristics of liquid liquid swirl coaxial injectors in fuel-rich conditions. Liquid oxygen and kerosene (Jet A-1) were burned in a range of mixture ratios (0.29-0.41) and chamber pressures (46-65 bar) in a gas generator for a liquid rocket engine. An injector head was connected to a water-cooled chamber and a short nozzle with or without an extension pipe between the chamber and the nozzle. The extension pipe acoustically simulated a turbine inlet manifold. The injector head had 37 identical swirl coaxial injectors. It is found that the characteristic velocity and combustion gas temperature are seldom influenced by the extension pipe, but are only functions of the mixture ratio. The dynamic pressure data show that the combustion instability in the fuel-rich gas generator equipped with biswirl coaxial injectors can be significantly affected by the mixture ratio and also by the extension pipe, which influences the resonant frequency in the chamber.

AB The purpose of this paper is to build a theoretical model for the hybrid rocket engine/motor and to validate it using experimental results. The work approaches the main problems of the hybrid motor: the scalability, the stability/controllability of the operating parameters and the increasing of the solid fuel regression rate. At first, we focus on theoretical models for hybrid rocket motor and compare the results with already available experimental data from various research groups. A primary computation model is presented together with results from a numerical algorithm based on a computational model. We present theoretical predictions for several commercial hybrid rocket motors, having different scales and compare them with experimental measurements of those hybrid rocket motors. Next the paper focuses on tribrid rocket motor concept, which by supplementary liquid fuel injection can improve the thrust controllability. A complementary computation model is also presented to estimate regression rate increase of solid fuel doped with oxidizer. Finally, the stability of the hybrid rocket motor is investigated using Liapunov theory. Stability coefficients obtained are dependent on burning parameters while the stability and command matrixes are identified. The paper presents thoroughly the input data of the model, which ensures the reproducibility of the numerical results by independent researchers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research proposes a low-frequency pulse detonation engine (LPDE) with the corresponding method of anti-high-G effect. It tries to adopt the advantages of both the traditional pulse detonation engine (PDE) and the solid fuel rocket to form a new kind of engine that can use high-energy solid fuel with enclosed high-pressure explosion to generate efficient pulse propulsion. With the development, not only will the benefits of the PDE and the solid fuel rocket be greatly promoted, but the possible damage of high-G effect associated with large pulse thrust can also be prevented. As a result, it conducts the development of a cutting-edge propulsion technology that can be employed in both aeronautical and astronautical engineering. With comparison of existing propulsion technologies, the proposed LPDE technology is expected to have the characteristics of small volume, light weight, high fuel efficiency, large propulsion thrust, effective mitigation of high-G effect, and being suitable for a new generation of aero-spacecrafts to run in both low atmospheric layer and outer space. Based on theoretical analysis, the research has essentially paved the way for the realization of LPDE technology. Two examples, one in zero-gravity environment and the other in one-gravity environment, are discussed to demonstrate the significance of the research.

AB With their unique operational characteristics, hybrid rockets can potentially provide safer, lower-cost avenues for spacecraft and missiles than the current solid propellant and liquid propellant systems. Classical hybrids can be throttled for thrust tailoring, perform in-flight motor shutdown and restart. In classical hybrids, the fuel is stored in the form of a solid grain, requiring only half the feed system hardware of liquid bipropellant engines. The commonly used fuels are benign, nontoxic, and not hazardous to store and transport. Solid fuel grains are not highly susceptible to cracks, imperfections, and environmental temperature and are therefore safer to manufacture, store, transport, and use for launch. The status of development based on the experience of the last few decades indicating the maturity of the hybrid rocket technology is given in brief.

AB Supercritical conditions are typically encountered in high-pressure combustion devices such as liquid propellant rockets and gas turbine engines. Significant real fluid behaviors including steep property variations occur when the fluid mixtures pass through the thermodynamic transcritical regime. The laminar flamelet concept is a robust and reliable approach that correctly accounts for real fluid effects, the large variation in thermophysical properties, and the detailed chemical kinetics for turbulent flames at transcritical and supercritical conditions. In the present study, the flamelet equations in the mixture fraction space are extended to treat the flame field of general fluids over transcritical and supercritical states. Flamelet computations are carried out for gaseous hydrogen and cryogenic liquid oxygen flames under a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. Based on numerical results, the detailed discussions are made for the effects of real fluid, pressure, and differential diffusion on the local flame structure and the characteristics encountered in liquid propellant rocket engines.

ID SYNTHETIC FLUID INCLUSIONS; SPECTRA; SYSTEMS; MONITOR; LEVEL
AB An integrated fiber optic Raman sensor was designed for real-time, nonintrusive detection of liquid nitrogen (LN(2)) in liquid oxygen (LO(2)) at high pressures and high flow rates. This was intended to monitor the quality of LO(2) in oxidizer feed lines during the ground testing of rocket engines. Various issues related to optical diagnosis of cryogenic fluids (LN(2)/LO(2)) in supercritical environment of rocket engine test facility, such as fluorescence from impurity in optical window of feed line, signal-noise ratio, and fast data acquisition time, etc., are well addressed. The integrated sensor employed a frequency doubled 532-nm continuous wave Nd:YAG laser as an excitation light source. The other optical components included were InPhotonics Raman probes, spectrometers, and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The spectrometer was used to collect the Raman spectrum of LN(2) and LO(2). The PMT detection unit was integrated with home-built LABVIEW software for fast monitoring of concentration ratios LN(2) and LO(2). Prior to designing an integrated sensor system, its optical components were also tested with gaseous nitrogen (GN(2)) and oxygen (GO(2)). (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB The spiral-grooved seal is a prime candidate for application to liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopumps. A theoretical model of double spiral-grooved seals dealing with the viscosity-temperature relation is presented. The effect of operating parameters (rotational speed, supply pressure) and configurative parameters (depth of spiral groove) on the basic static characteristics (opening force, leakage, static friction torque, face temperature, and power loss) of double spiral-grooved seals are examined. Comparisons are presented between measurements and theoretical predications for a narrow spiral-grooved face seal with an average diameter of 100 mm, operating at high speed and using water as a test fluid. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that the temperature on seal faces rises and friction torque increases with the speed and supply pressure, and these increases vary slightly with the depth of the spiral groove. These findings lend great theoretical and experimental insights to the design of face seals applied in liquid engine turbopumps.

AB The technology of electromagnetic driven Lorentz rail accelerators (LRAs) has been significantly improved in the last years. Due to the extreme acceleration in LRA systems, there are high demands regarding the mechanical stresses. It is assumed that materials can withstand stresses exceeding the nominal limits related to static conditions if they are applied for a short time. To assess the short-time material strength of a hydroxyl-terminated-polybutadiene rocket fuel grain, experiments shall be carried out using the High-Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Gottingen of the German Aerospace Center in Gottingen as a high-acceleration test facility. In the first step, different samples of the rocket fuel grain and composite materials are tested under high acceleration and analyzed by a visual check. In this paper, first of all, different samples of the rocket fuel grain and composite materials are tested under high acceleration and analyzed by a visual check. In the second step, onboard electronics mounted on the piston are developed to collect the data of the strain and the deformation of the composite/fuel grain and to directly measure the acceleration. With this electronically enhanced specimen, another test is carried out, and measurement data are acquired. The evaluated experiments shall provide useful information to design a hybrid rocket engine for a small launcher, capable to be launched from an LRA.

AB In this study, we aim to clarify the blowoff mechanism for flame spreading in an opposed laminar flow in narrow solid fuel ducts. To clarify this mechanism we conducted two experiments. First, we observed the changes of the flame spread rate at various oxygen velocities, ambient pressures, and port diameters. For flame spreading in laminar flow, combustion modes could be classified into 3 distinct regimes based on the strength of the opposed flow, i.e., chemical regime, thermal regime, and stabilized regime. This result is consistent with the result in turbulent flow. In the stabilized regime, quenching distance is almost constant despite oxygen velocity. In order to investigate the effect of ambient pressure and port diameter of fuels on blowoff limit, transition oxygen velocity is observed. As a result, transition oxygen velocity is proportional to the logarithm of the ambient pressure and port diameter. This relation is applicable despite the flow condition. Furthermore, we calculated velocity gradient at the fuel surface to reveal the determining factor of the blowoff limit in laminar flow. Consequently, velocity gradient, which is considered to dominate flow separation in laminar flow, would not be constant. This is because the velocity gradient at the fuel surface could not be evaluated by only the assumption of Hagen-Poiseuille flow but other parameters, such as vaporized fuel gas and natural convection by buoyancy should be included.

ID SYSTEM
AB Metastable Intermolecular Composites or so-called Nanoenergetic Materials have been widely touted for their potential to fulfill dreams in high density energetic materials and nanotechnology. They are likely to become the next-generation explosives, propellants and primes as they enable flexibility in energy density and power release through control of particle size, tunable stoichiometry and choice of fuel and oxidizer. Despite intense examination by scientists and engineers worldwide the temperature progress and velocity of the thermal front propagation on the nanostructured formulations, however, gas pressure evolution and rate of gas release are not well investigated and understood. This issue has seriously impeded realization of various potential emerging applications envisioned in rocket solid fuels and explosives, which require a high pressure discharge in a short period of time as well as in bio-defeat systems. This highlight describes principles and development of Nanoenergetic Gas-Generators (NGG) systems comprising high PV (pressure x volume) values and energy densities (up to 25.7 kJ cm(-3)) that may have several potential civil and military applications. Our recent study revealed that Al/Bi(2)O(3) and Al/I(2)O(5) nanocomposites can generate a transient pressure pulse more than three times larger than that during the explosion of traditional thermite reactive mixtures.

AB Self-excited combustion instabilities of the first tangential mode have been found in a research combustor operated with the cryogenic propellant combination of hydrogen/oxygen. In a series of consecutive test campaigns, the influence of operating conditions on these self-excited combustion instabilities was examined. This included a variation of the combustion chamber pressure, the mixture ratio, and the propellant temperatures. It has been shown how these operating parameters influence the resonance frequencies of the combustion chamber. The analysis of the influence of operating conditions on the oscillation amplitude of the first tangential mode indicated that the instability occurred when the frequency of the first tangential mode of the combustion chamber was shifted into the frequency of the second longitudinal mode of the liquid oxygen injector. With a variation of the injector length, and therefore its longitudinal resonance frequencies, this hypothesis has been tested. Based on the experimental observations it was concluded that the observed instabilities were a result of the interaction of combustion chamber resonance frequencies with injector resonance frequencies. The heat release rate oscillation was shown to be a result of the injector acoustics and not of the combustion chamber pressure oscillations.

AB The geometric configuration of the solid fuel is a key parameter affecting the fuel regression rate in hybrid rocket motors. In this paper, a semi-empirical regression rate model is developed to investigate the geometric effect on the fuel regression rate by incorporating the hydraulic diameter into the classical model. The semi-empirical model indicates that the fuel regression rate decreases with increasing hydraulic diameter and is proportional to d(h)(-0.2) when convective heat transfer is dominant. Then a numerical model considering turbulence, combustion, solid fuel pyrolysis, and a solid-gas coupling model is established to further investigate the geometric effect. Eight motors with different solid fuel grains are simulated, and four methods of scaling the regression rate between different solid fuel grains are compared. The results indicate that the solid fuel regression rates are approximate the same when the hydraulic diameters are equal. The numerical results verify the accuracy of the semi-empirical model.

AB A new scramjet configuration using solid fuel as propellant is proposed, namely, the solid-fuel rocket scramjet. Experimental and numerical investigation of the solid-fuel rocket scramjet combustor was conducted to evaluate its performance. The experiment simulated a flight environment of Mach 4 at a 17km altitude. Magnesium-based solid fuel was used as propellant in this study. The results show that secondary combustion occurs in supersonic combustor. The combustion efficiency of the propellant is about 65%, and the total pressure recovery is about 0.5. These imply that the scramjet configuration using solid fuel as a propellant is feasible. The results of the numerical analysis show that a normal shock wave is generated in the core flow of the combustor, and this is due to all of the fuel-rich gas being injected in the same cross section.

   propellant storage
AB Cryogenic propellants such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LO2) are a part of NASA's future space exploration plans due to their high specific impulse for rocket motors of upper stages. However, the low storage temperatures of LH2 and LO2 cause substantial boil-off losses for long duration missions. These losses can be eliminated by incorporating high performance cryocooler technology to intercept heat load to the propellant tanks and modulating the cryocooler temperature to control tank pressure. The technology being developed by NASA is the reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocooler and its integration to the propellant tank through a distributed cooling tubing network coupled to the tank wall. This configuration was recently tested at NASA Glenn Research Center in a vacuum chamber and cryoshroud that simulated the essential thermal aspects of low Earth orbit, its vacuum and temperature. This test series established that the active cooling system integrated with the propellant tank eliminated boil-off and robustly controlled tank pressure. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID TANKS
AB A problem common to both space launch applications and cryogenic propulsion test facilities is providing suitable thermal insulation for complex cryogenic piping, tanks, and components that cannot be vacuum jacketed or otherwise be broad-area-covered. To meet such requirements and provide a practical solution to the problem, a layered composite insulation system has been developed for nonvacuum applications and extreme environmental exposure conditions. Layered composite insulation system for extreme conditions (or LCX) is particularly suited for complex piping or tank systems that are difficult or practically impossible to insulate by conventional means. Consisting of several functional layers, the aerogel blanket-based system can be tailored to specific thermal and mechanical performance requirements.. The operational principle of the system is layer-pairs working in combination. Each layer pair is comprised of a primary insulation layer and a compressible radiant barrier layer. Vacuum jacketed piping systems, whether part of the ground equipment or the flight vehicle, typically include numerous terminations, disconnects, umbilical connections, or branches that must be insulated by nonvacuum means. Broad-area insulation systems, such as spray foam or rigid foam panels, are often the lightweight materials of choice for vehicle tanks, but the plumbing elements, feedthroughs, appurtenances, and structural supports all create "hot spot" areas that are not readily insulated by similar means. Finally, the design layouts of valve control skids used for launch pads and test stands can be nearly impossible to insulate because of their complexity and high density of components and instrumentation. Primary requirements for such nonvacuum thermal insulation systems include the combination of harsh conditions, including full weather exposure, vibration, and structural loads. Further requirements include reliability and the right level of system breathability for thermal cycling. The LCX system is suitable for temperatures from approximately 4 K to 400 K and can be designed to insulate liquid hydrogen, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, or liquid methane equipment. Laboratory test data for thermal and mechanical performance are presented. Field demonstration cases and examples in operational cryogenic systems are also given. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Combustion in a turbulent boundary layer over a solid fuel is studied using simultaneous schlieren and OH* chemiluminescence imaging. The flow configuration is representative of a hybrid rocket motor combustor. Six different hydrocarbon fuels, including both classical hybrid rocket fuels and a high regression rate fuel (paraffin wax), are burned in an undiluted oxygen free-stream at pressures ranging from atmospheric to 1524.2 kPa (221.1 psi). A detailed explanation of methods for registering the schlieren and OH* chemiluminescence images to one another is presented, and additionally, details of the routines used to extract flow features of interest (like the boundary layer height and flame location) are provided. At atmospheric pressure, the boundary layer location is consistent between all fuels; however, the flame location varies for each fuel. The flame zone appears to be smoothly distributed over the fuel surface at atmospheric pressure. At elevated pressures and correspondingly increased Dahmkohler number (but at constant Reynolds number), flame morphology is markedly different, exhibiting large rollers in a shear layer above the fuel grain and finer structures in the flame. The chemiluminescence intensity is found to be roughly proportional to the fuel burn rate at both atmospheric and elevated chamber pressures.

AB A novel energetic interpenetrating polymer network (EIPN) nanocomposite was designed and tested, which was comprised of functionalized MWCNTs (fMWCNTs) covalently attached to hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) by a facile in situ polymerization technique. Three types of fMWCNTs (COOH-fMWCNTs, NCO-fMWCNTs and alkyne-fMWCNTs) were synthesized and well characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of fMWCNTs on the mechanical, dispersion, and thermal properties of NCO-fMWCNTs/HTPB PU and alkyne-fMWCNTs/acyl-GAP click was investigated and synergetic properties were achieved as compared to neat HTPB and GAP PU networks. Here we develop for the first time an EIPN nanocomposite based on NCO-fMWCNTs/HTPB PU and alkyne-fMWCNTs/acyl-GAP with different weight ratios and superior tensile strength of 8.17 MPa with 312% elongation at break was achieved with thermally more stable crosslinked networks. A solid composite propellant based on NCO-fMWCNTs/HTPB PU and alkyne-fMWCNTs/acyl-GAP was also prepared and mechanical and thermal properties investigated. An extensive enhancement in the thermo-mechanical properties of the NCO-fMWCNTs/HTPB PU and alkyne-fMWCNTs/acyl-GAP EIPN based nanocomposite have been achieved which may be ascribed to good dispersion of fMWCNTs in the polymer matrix, strong interfacial bonding and entanglements of crosslinked networks during in situ polymerization. This EIPN based composite propellant with improved mechanical and thermal properties paves the way for its straightforward application as a solid fuel in advanced missile technology.

AB In the present study, an analytical model based on convective heat feedback is developed for the estimation of the solid fuel surface regression rate of hybrid rocket engines with head-end swirling-flow oxidizer injection. The convective heat transfer between the axial core flow and the burning fuel surface, coupled with the convective heat feedback between the effective tangential flow and the burning fuel surface, is the means by which the fuel regression rate is presumed to be increased by swirl, above that due to the axial mass flux. The representation of the effective boundary layers used in this study includes the influence of transpiration, effective hydraulic diameters (for flows in the axial and tangential direction), and fuel surface roughness. From the literature, a variety of propellant combinations, engine sizes, and flow swirl numbers are evaluated for engines having circular-port fuel grains, with sample model results provided. The predicted fuel regression rates for the most part compare quite well with the corresponding experimental data.

AB An experimental study is conducted to evaluate amine-borane materials in solid fuels that create hypergolic combustion with nitric acid. Ignition delays as short as 3.3 ms have been measured for fuels containing amine-boranes in an epoxy binder: one of the fastest ignition delays ever recorded for a hypergolic hybrid fuel. The heats of formation of the amine-boranes were measured and theoretical (ideal) performance calculated. Some amine-boranes exhibit a double peak performance allowing for a range of oxidizer/fuel combinations resulting in high performance. Amine-borane/fuel binder combinations can produce a 3.8 and 8.2% increase in I-sp and rho I-sp, respectively, over monomethylhydrazine and a 4-11% increase in I-sp and a 17% decrease to 5% increase in rho I-sp over other hypergolic hybrid rockets that use similar oxidizers. Amine-boranes also exhibit trends of being less toxic and more air stable than their base amines. In addition to the hypergolic properties, performance alone motivates the use of these materials, and it was found that amine-boranes could improve I-sp by 2-6% and rho I-sp by 1-11% compared with conventional rocket fuels, excluding liquid H-2.

AB Injectors of cryogenic liquid rocket engines produce large polydisperse and dense sprays due to the pressure and mass flow conditions. Atomization is the dominating process that drives the flame behavior in cryogenic jet flames, when the propellants are injected in subcritical conditions. The main objective of this study is the characterization of a liquid oxygen (LOX) spray in gaseous hydrogen (GH2), in reacting conditions. In the breakup region where liquid particles are not spherical, laser based drop-size techniques suffer from a low validation data rate; thus imaging techniques can be better suited to characterize the spray. High-speed shadowgraphs were used to provide the spray characteristics such as sizes and velocities of the LOX dispersed phase atomized by a GH2 co-flow injected by a shear coaxial injector in a 1 MPa combustion chamber. Cryogenic combustion investigations presented in this paper were carried out on the Mascotte test bench, at Onera. The reacting case was compared qualitatively to a cold flow test, with gaseous He instead of GH2, for which LOX spray shadowgraphs were also recorded. The cold LOX jet was constituted by an envelope of small droplets around the LOX core whereas in the reacting case, those small droplets were not present and bigger liquid structures were revealed, due to vaporization by the flame. Moreover, the difference in terms of gas density between the hot fire and the cold case led to a reduction of the aerodynamic forces which can also explain that droplet velocities, at the injector exit, were higher in the cold case. Velocities of the dispersed phase in reacting conditions were obtained with two different imaging methods, which were applied to the same shadowgraphs: a PTV algorithm and a PIV software, developed at Onera. Both methods agreed well as soon as the droplet density is high enough and they showed that droplet velocities decreased by a factor of 3 in the area investigated. Droplet sizes were measured by image processing in the atomization zone and results were compared with Sauter mean diameters obtained with phase Doppler measurements from the literature. The droplet size is combined with PTV to obtain droplet size/velocity correlations which show that velocity of the smallest droplets decreased more rapidly than velocity of the biggest one, as the axial distance from the injector increased.

AB Coupled Euler-Lagrange simulations are performed for a subcritically operated model rocket combustor at 10 bar pressure (MASCOTTE A-10 test case). A Lagrangian spray model is used to simulate the liquid phase. This liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen single element combustor experiment has been the focus of many numerical studies. In contrast to previous investigations, time-accurate unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations are performed. A good spatial resolution is achieved by using a fifth-order multidimensional limiting process scheme to discretize the inviscid fluxes. Instead of assuming axisymmetry, the three-dimensional geometry of the rectangular combustor is taken into account. However, only a quarter of the combustor is simulated, to limit the computational cost. Presented results indicate that three-dimensional effects are important, questioning the assumption of axisymmetry. A second important finding is that time-averaged unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes results agree much better with experimental data than those of a comparable steady-state simulation. Close to the injector, results show a strong unsteadiness of the turbulent flame, which has been observed in the experiment, too. Finally, pressure fluctuations are monitored at several positions in the combustor and analyzed by fast Fourier transform. The peak amplitudes in the pressure spectra could successfully be assigned to the first longitudinal acoustic mode and its higher harmonics.

ID REGRESSION RATE
AB A novel paraffin-based blends fuel prepared from pure paraffin wax of the alkane family with polyethylene of the alkene family is proposed and tested in a slab motor to visualize the droplet entrainment mechanism followed by a hybrid rocket motor test to analyze its combustion characteristics. The mechanical strength of the proposed blended fuel is investigated by increasing the polyethylene weight percent. The overall regression rate of 5 wt % of polyethylene with 95 wt % of pure paraffin is found to be 3.9 factors higher than that of a pure polyethylene. Improved combustion efficiency under the condition of a similar oxidizer mass flow rate range is achieved with respect to pure paraffin fuel in which performance gain is comparable to that of the SP-1a fuel of Stanford University. Spectrum analysis of the chamber pressure shows no critical instability mode for the range of this study. The blend fuel is found to be comparatively effective for the hybrid rocket fuel in terms of mechanical strength, combustion efficiency, combustion instability, and combustion performance.
