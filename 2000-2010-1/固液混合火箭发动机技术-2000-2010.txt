AB The renewed interest on ducted rockets impulses their investigation. In this article, switching control in the working process of ducted rockets is focused on, in order to obtain optimal thrust control while avoiding phenomena like inlet buzz. Firstly multiobjective control problems of ducted rockets during its working process are discussed. Then the dynamic mathematical models of gas flow regulating system, thrust regulation control loop and inlet buzz protection loop are established and analyzed. Lastly, the switching strategy and PID controller are applied to the ducted rocket system, and the influence of integral limitation of controllers is analyzed. In conclusion, it is useful to introduce the multi-objective switching control to ducted rockets, and simulation results show its validity. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, we present two simple mean flow solutions that mimic the bulk gas motion inside a full-length, cylindrical hybrid rocket engine. Two distinct methods are used. The first is based on steady, axisymmetric, rotational, and incompressible flow conditions. It leads to an Eulerian solution that observes the normal sidewall mass injection condition while assuming a sinusoidal injection profile at the head end wall. The second approach constitutes a slight improvement over the first in its inclusion of viscous effects. At the outset, a first order viscous approximation is constructed using regular perturbations in the reciprocal of the wall injection Reynolds number. The asymptotic approximation is derived from a general similarity reduced Navier-Stokes equation for a viscous tube with regressing porous walls. It is then compared and shown to agree remarkably well with two existing solutions. The resulting formulations enable us to model the streamtubes observed in conventional hybrid engines in which the parallel motion of gaseous oxidizer is coupled with the cross-streamwise (i.e., sidewall) addition of solid fuel. Furthermore, estimates for pressure, velocity, and vorticity distributions in the simulated engine are provided in closed form. Our idealized hybrid engine is modeled as a porous circular-port chamber with head end injection. The mathematical treatment is based on a standard similarity approach that is tailored to permit sinusoidal injection at the head end. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4002397]

AB Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy has been used to investigate cryogenic liquid oxygen/gaseous methane (LOX/CH4) flames on a medium-size test facility at a pressure of 0.24 MPa and mass flow of 0.025 kg/s. Single-shot, broadband CARS spectra with simultaneous detection of the Q-branches of hydrogen and water molecules were recorded with good signal-to-noise ratio. Temperature was deduced from the H-2 and H2O CARS profiles. The spatial temperature distribution in a comparatively harsh environment has been measured successfully. The measurements took place in the windowed combustion chamber of the DLRM3 test facility, aiming to provide data for validation of rocket combustor modeling.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID CODE VALIDATION; DYNAMICS; ENGINE; PERFORMANCE; INJECTOR
AB Proof of the Predictive accuracy of models used in simulation of the high-pressure, high-heat flux environments inside operating rocket combustion chambers is limited by several factors including multiple phases, unsteadiness, high energy release, turbulence, and complex flow geometry. The severe environment also complicates the measurement of temperature, pressure, and chemical composition within the combustor. This paper describes an experiment to collect and analyze benchmark-quality validation data for a multi-element rocket combustor using liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen operating at chamber pressures from 300 to 1000 psia at mixture ratios from three to six. For these propellants, the stoichiometric mixture ratio is eight. The combustor was instrumented with 44 coaxial thermocouple pairs to measure axial and circumferential temperature fields and 8 pressure transducers to measure axial pressure profiles. The local heat flux at the inner wall of the combustion chamber computed at each temperature measurement location was found to vary between 4 and 20 Btu/in.(2)/s. The circumferential variation of heat flux seems to indicate mixing and radial outflow of combustion gases between injector elements, a phenomenon that is not observed in injector configurations with tighter spacing. Further, the axial pressure profiles and head-end temperature measurements suggest the presence of recirculation zones near the injector face.

TI Control Effects of Baffle on Combustion Instability in a LOX/GH(2)
   Rocket Engine
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
ID INJECTION
AB The combustion instability encountered unexpectedly in hot-firing tests of the YF-960 liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (LOX/GH(2)) rocket engine was numerically researched. Here, the emphasis was on evaluating the control effects of two kinds of baffle configurations on combustion instability. The integrated physical model and numerical method were presented to solve the turbulent, three-dimensional, two-phase, and full-size LOX/GH(2) rocket combustion process. The dominant oscillation frequency characteristics that appeared in the hot-firing tests were reproduced and confirmed first, which validated the computational fluid dynamics code to a certain extent. The baffle effects were investigated by the developed mass flow flux perturbing model. Results show that the control effect of the hub-and-six-blade baffle on the one-order tangential-mode oscillation frequency of 5800 Hz is better than that of the hub-and-three-blade baffle. Although the two kinds of baffles have similar effects on the radial-mode instability, the control effect is better for damping the 5800 Hz oscillation than the 2900 Hz oscillation. This research has provided direct design data for engineers, and it is valuable in further understanding the baffle-eliminating mechanisms.

ID SPRAY CHARACTERISTICS
AB Uni-element combustion tests were conducted employing double swirl coaxial injectors fed by liquid oxygen and kerosene. In this study, two major experimental parameters have been considered: the recess length and fuel swirl chamber shape. It was revealed that combustion efficiency depends mainly on the mixing mechanism for the present swirl coaxial injectors, and acoustic intensities become reduced with a decrease of the recess length. Low-frequency pressure oscillations around 200 Hz have been observed for all injectors. Dynamic behavior examined by the measurements of pressure fluctuations considerably differs for external and internal mixing based on the recess length. Internal mixing induces a mixture ratio and a total mass flow rate that vary with strong bias at a single frequency, resulting in high-amplitude pressure fluctuations generated by combustion of pulsating coherent flow structures. However, the results for external mixing show that the fuel and oxidizer mixture flow carries more dispersed, multiple-wave characteristics due to the broad mixing region as well as disintegration and merging phenomena of propellant sheets before mixing.

ID SPRAY CHARACTERISTICS; ROCKET ENGINE; LIQUID; INJECTORS
AB The dynamic characteristics of fuel-rich combustion have been studied using an experimental combustor simulating a gas generator for a liquid rocket engine. The combustor burns liquid oxygen and fuel (Jet A-1) at a mixture ratio of about 0.32 and a chamber pressure ranging from 4.10 to 7.24 MPa, which covers subcritical to supercritical pressures of oxygen. For the investigation of combustion dynamics, pressure fluctuation measurements using piezoelectric sensors have been a major probe throughout the present study. Two different types of injector heads equipped with biliquid swirl coaxial injectors and either a short nozzle or a turbine manifold nozzle have been used in the study. Fuel-rich combustion of both injector heads with the short nozzle revealed pressure pulsation at frequencies of about 128 Hz, which attenuates along with an increase of a chamber pressure. Combustion tests with the turbine manifold nozzle conducted at chamber pressures lower than the oxygen critical pressure showed combustion instabilities at a frequency of 330 Hz, which has been identified as a longitudinal resonant mode by a linear acoustic analysis. The combustion instabilities seem to be induced by inherent pressure fluctuations from the biliquid swirl coaxial injector when the chamber pressure is below the oxygen critical pressure.

ID DESIGN
AB System design of liquid rocket engines must consider engine performance, weight, cost, and reliability requirements. A general design optimization framework has been developed in this paper to select the best system parameters for liquid rocket engines with gas-generator cycles. The object is to maximize the specific impulse and vacuum thrust-to-weight ratio of the engine with given system requirements and design assumptions by changing thrust-chamber pressure and mixture ratio. The system analysis, along with the engine weight estimation, is based on a modular scheme. Multidisciplinary design optimization formulations including multidisciplinary feasible and collaborative optimization are used, evaluated, and compared during the optimization process. Several techniques of multi-objective processing are also used to identify the Pareto frontier and the optimal compromise solutions. A proposed cryogenic-propellant engine using liquid oxygen and hydrogen with a gas-generator cycle is studied as a specific example. Moreover, uncertainties in the engine operation, such as thrust-chamber pressure and mixture ratio, are taken into account as random variables in the reliability-based optimization. Results are presented to illustrate the tradeoff between the engine performance and reliability requirements.

AB In a cryogenic environment, components like bearings with interacting surfaces in relative motion (tribosystems) often generate undesired heat and experience high wear. Because the properties of conventional bearing materials like stainless steel cannot be applied to this temperature range, the PVD coating based on metal-metal pairs with better frictional properties must be employed. To test the suitability of the Ni-Cu-Ag-based PVD coatings of hybrid bearings for liquid rocket engine turbopumps and to obtain reliable coating material data in the extreme environment, the tribological behaviors of coatings under the cryogenic fluid (liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen) and water lubricated conditions are studied, respectively. In the paper, the specimens are in a vibrocryotribometer with the ball-on-plane contact type, and various running conditions in terms of lubricants, contacting loading, and contacting velocity are examined. The simulated experiment for testing the actual tribological performance of Ni-Cu-Ag-based PVD coatings for hybrid bearings is tested. The results of the tests indicate that the coatings can be suitable for cryogenic tribosystems of turbopumps. In the cryogenic environment, the volume wear rate of coatings increases rapidly with the contacting loading, but 15 min later, the volume wear volume of coatings turns into 2.5-15 x 10(-4) mm(3). Besides, under the liquid oxygen condition in simulating the liquid rocket engine turbopumps environment, the friction coefficients are 0.03-0.1. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Hybrid rocket engine; Solid fuel; Surface regression rate
AB The present effort is towards predicting with some accuracy hybrid rocket engine fuel regression rates under standard flow conditions. A convective heat feedback modelling approach is applied in tying the mass-flux-dependent heat flux directed into the regressing fuel surface, to the subsequent solid fuel grain regression rate. Factors such as transpiration, hydraulic port diameter, and effective fuel surface roughness are incorporated into the phenomenological surface regression rate model. A number of comparisons between the model's predicted results and corresponding experimental data are made, in illustrating the efficacy of the present approach for a classical head-end-injection engine. Where substantial differences between theory and experiment exist, this might be due to one of several identifiable factors related to non-standard flow, such as the presence of radiant heating, swirl or flow impingement in or at the boundaries of the experimental core flow.

DE Combustion; Acoustic coupling; High frequency instability; Injection
AB High frequency combustion instabilities have technical importance in the design of liquid rocket engines. These phenomena involve a strong coupling between transverse acoustic modes and combustion. They are currently being investigated by combining experimentation and numerical simulations. On the experimental level, the coupling is examined in a model scale system featuring a multiple injector combustor (MIC) comprising five coaxial injectors fed with liquid oxygen and gaseous methane. This system is equipped with a novel VHAM actuator (Very High Amplitude Modulator) which comprises two nozzles and a rotating toothed wheel blocking the nozzles in an alternate fashion. This device was designed to obtain the highest possible levels of transverse oscillation in the MIC. After a brief review of the VHAM, this article reports cold flow experiments using this modulator. Velocity maps obtained under resonant conditions using the VHAM are examined at different instants during a cycle of oscillation. Experimental data are compared with numerical pressure and velocity fields obtained from an acoustic solver. The good agreement observed in the nozzle vicinity indicates that numerical simulations can be used to analyze the complex flow field generated by the VHAM. To cite this article: Y. Mery et al., C.

DE Magnetic levitation; superconducting magnet
AB Two superconducting magnets, mounted on a rocket sled are propelled by solid fuel rocket motors. During sled motion, the field from the magnets interacts with passive copper rails embedded in a concrete guideway to produce levitation and flight stability. Six flight tests have been successfully conducted to date with the most recent in April 2008 reaching 673 kilometer per hour. The magnets consist of racetrack coils, which are wet lay-up wound with rectangular NbTi wire. They were tested to 245 A with a peak field of 7.5 T and winding current density of 38 kA/cm(2). The coils are bath cooled. A passive valving system prevents loss of liquid during rapid acceleration and deceleration. Boil-off gas cools an aluminum thermal shield and the current leads. In this paper we present the most recent magnet design, static and flight test results.

AB We examine the combustion response of a flame anchored to two 1/4-spaces of solid fuel and oxidizer, a configuration relevant to the combustion of heterogeneous solid propellants. A time-periodic shear flow is applied to model the shear that can be generated by the presence of acoustics or turbulence in a rocket chamber. To estimate the magnitude and frequency of the shear for the case of a turbulent flow, we present DNS results of a planar periodic rocket, a configuration that has its roots in a multiscale analysis. Such a configuration allows for the determination of the shear parameters as a function of motor geometry and downstream location. The response of the flame to this shear, the heat flux to the surface, and the burning rate are calculated numerically. Significant enhancement to the burn rate, commonly known as erosive burning, is found. (C) 2008 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A nozzle boundary-layer control system is under consideration for application in high-pressure rockets to mitigate the erosion rates of a graphite nozzle. The current design contains multiple center-perforated solid grains of fuel-rich materials consisting of succinic acid and polyvinyl acetate. This combination of the fuel-rich grains was selected due to high carbon and hydrogen contents along with relatively low evaporation temperature for generating fuel-rich gases. The characterization of the pyrolysis behavior or fuel-rich grains is a requirement for any subsequent quantitative analysis pertaining to the effect of the nozzle boundary-layer control system on graphite rocket nozzle erosion rates. Two separate experiments were conducted: 1) to determine the regression rate of solid fuel-rich grains under controlled heat flux or temperature conditions, and 2) to characterize its chemical decomposition and/or evaporation behavior. An empirical correlation between beat flux and surface regression rate of fuel-rich grains was developed. From Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, the fuel-rich grains were found to melt and evaporate at temperatures up to 773 K. These results have been used in parallel study nozzle throat erosion processes using computational simulation.

AB Flame stabilization in the near-injector region of a subscale liquid propellant rocket combustion chamber has been investigated using optical diagnostics. Several different single shear coaxial injectors have been used to inject liquid oxygen (LOX) and methane at relevant operating conditions. Three main operating points cover the range of sub-, near-, and supercritical conditions with respect to the thermodynamic critical point of oxygen. Whereas liquid oxygen has been injected at typical temperatures of about 120 K, gaseous methane was injected at near-ambient temperatures of about 270 K. Similar to previous investigations performed with LOX/H(2) combustion, spontaneous OH chemiluminescence has been detected to characterize the flame anchoring zone near the LOX post tip. Theoretical considerations have indicated that the binary mixture of oxygen and methane shows an entirely different behavior compared with the oxygen/hydrogen system. This is believed to have an influence on the spray evolution and mixing characteristics at supercritical conditions. The experimental investigation includes both the ignition transient as well as the steady-state operating points. It has been detected that the LOX/CH(4) flame shows very similar characteristics in comparison with a LOX/H(2) flame at similar operating conditions. Critical flame stabilization at the startup transient has been found during all hot runs. At steady-state conditions, the influence of the injection parameters on the flame shape is comparable to previous LOX/hydrogen investigations.

AB The effect of a recessed liquid oxygen tube in shear coaxial injection has been investigated experimentally using an optically accessible subscale rocket combustor operated at pressures between 40 and 60 bar. Different single-shear coaxial injectors have been used to inject liquid oxygen and methane at relevant operating conditions covering sub-, near-, and supercritical pressures with respect to the critical point of oxygen. Liquid oxygen was injected at 120 K and the injection temperature of gaseous methane was about 275 K. Detection of spontaneous OH and CH chemiluminescence has been performed to characterize the flame-anchoring zone near the liquid oxygen post tip. In addition, the influence of the injector geometry on the combustion roughness and stability has been investigated during steady-state operating points. An increased flame expansion was observed with a recessed injector element. At a low momentum flux ratio, the pressure drop across the injector increases with a recessed liquid oxygen tube compared with a flush tube. Furthermore, a recessed liquid oxygen tube led to a smoother combustion in general; however, this configuration also led to additional resonant frequencies in the chamber acoustics.

AB This article considers the influence of fluctuations in temperature on acoustic resonance characteristics of a combustion chamber. This analysis is concerned With acoustic coupling experienced in high frequency instabilities. Experiments carried out on a Multiple injector combustor (MIC) operating Willi liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are used to simulate oil a model scale the situation prevailing in a liquid rocket thrust chamber. External acoustic modulations are generated by periodically blocking an auxiliary nozzle Willi a rotating toothed wheel. By continuously changing the rotation velocity, it is possible to apply a linear frequency sweep and obtain the response of the system to all external excitation. It is found that the chamber quality factor under hot fire conditions is reduced with respect to the one measured under cold flow conditions. This is shown to be correlated With the level and spatial extension of temperature fluctuations inside the chamber. Temperature fluctuations induce variations in the speed of sound Which in turn Perturb the eigenfrequencies of the system and modify its response. This effect is modeled in a simplified way by considering a second order dynamical system featuring an eigenfrequency which fluctuates around its mean value. The dynamics is analyzed by making use of simulations and by the method of averaging. It is shown that when the eigenfrequency fluctuates, the system behaves as if it had an augmented level of dissipation and that this induces a reduction in the quality factor. It is concluded that this mechanism could have an important impact on the development of oscillations in liquid rocket engines. (C) 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Tetra-ol glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) is one of the best candidates for the solid fuel of gas hybrid rocket system because of self-combustibility, better mechanical property and high heat of formation, and comprehensive understanding of combustion phenomena is indispensable for Such an application. Combustion model of GAP, which is one-dimensional three-phase mode combustion model, was developed by Beckstead et al. and they applied it to tri-ol GAP Successfully. We have applied this model to tetra-ol GAP as an initial attempt, and numerical simulation showed that Maximum temperatures in the gas phase exceeded those of experimental results significantly, and calculated burning rates were Much higher than strand burner data, thus, modification of the model taking account of combustion incompleteness was found to be necessary. Combustion residues of GAP were investigated, and those were found to be composed of soot (black color), and high viscosity residue (HVR), and yellow powder which was only observed at high pressures. These residues were analyzed by means of SEM and FTIR, and mass balance was also measured. Modifications of combustion model were made taking the residue analysis results into account as Blow Off Mechanism. simulated final temperature in the gas phase and burning rate arc lowered effectively and coincide well with experimental data adjusting kinetic parameters.

AB The understanding of physical and chemical processes occuring in many applications in sciences and engineering is important to ensure stability and efficiency of their performance. Examples are the combustion process in direct-injection engines,,as turbine combustors. and liquid rocket propulsion systems. The objective of this paper is the numerical investigation of laminar methane/air and methane/oxygen flames where different Mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen in the oxidizer stream are studied. Moreover, liquid oxygen (LOX) spray flames with carrier gas methane directed against a methane stream are investigated in the counterflow Configuration. These structures may be used in (spray) flamelet library or flamelet generated manifold computations of turbulent combustion. The mathematical model is based oil two-dimensional equations which are transferred into one-dimensional equations Using a similarity transformation. The numerical simulation concerns the axisymmetric Configuration with all adaptive numerical grid for the gas phase. Detailed models of all relevant processes are employed: in particular, it detailed chemical reaction mechanism is used which comprises 35 species including C(2) involving 294 elementary reactions. The thermodynamic data for CH(4) and O(2) below 300K are implemented for normal and elevated pressures. For the CH(4)/air and all oxygenated flame, the present results are compared with results from literature. The CH(4)/O(2) flame is studied for elevated pressures up to 2MPa. Extinction conditions are evaluated for use ill turbulent flamelet computations. It is shown that oxygen dilution, pressure. and strain rate have it pronounced effect on flame structure. The use of liquid compared to gaseous oxygen strongly affects flame structure.

AB A novel injection concept for cryogenic liquid propellant rocket engines has been tested and verified successfully using an optically accessible combustion chamber. The injector consists of a porous faceplate made from sinter metal and five LOX posts arranged in a classical parallel showerhead configuration. While liquid oxygen is injected at similar velocities known from typical coaxial injector elements, the fuel enters the combustion chamber at much lower velocities. The flame stabilization for both LOX/H-2 and LOX/CH4 propellant combination has been investigated at sub-, near-, and supercritical pressures. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Method for crew-escape risk-envelope assessment during ascent
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Computational simulations and analyses may be used to quantify the risk envelope for crew escape resulting from an accidental detonation of explosive materials at a specified time during the ascent phase for crew exploration vehicles. Here, a methodology was developed and applied to assess the explosive risk potential, focusing on internal detonations or explosions. The approach was to computationally model the geometry of a launch vehicle and the time evolution of an accident scenario with explosive detonation. A series of detailed detonation simulations were completed for three different crew exploration vehicle launch vehicle configurations. All simulations assumed the formation of an explosive mixture of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Two different energy-release models were used in this study. One was based on programmed burn with a Jones-Wilkins-Lee analytical description of the reaction-product expansion isentrope, and the other used a volumetric energy source formulation. Based on this methodology and simulations, the predicted pressure field had significant magnitudes in the region of the service module and crew exploration vehicle. In fact, the overpressure is so severe that it would not be a survivable event for the crew.

ID BEHAVIOR; POWDERS
AB Aluminum nanoparticles modified with various additives (Ba, gasoline, and organosilicon resin) were obtained by arc plasma recondensation. The chemical composition, morphology, and thermal properties of nanoparticles and the characteristics of combustion of energy-producing condensed systems containing nanoaluminum were studied experimentally. The structure of the particles was determined by X-ray diffraction (a Rigaku Geigerflex diffractometer), transmission electron microscopy (JEM 2000 EX-II), scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM 7401F), atomic force microscopy (SOLVER P-47), and differential scanning calorimetry (NETZSCH STA 409). The replacement of aluminum powder with micron particles with nanodisperse aluminum increased the rate of combustion of stoichiometric compositions on the basis of ammonium perchlorate by an order of magnitude at a pressure of 40 atm. Simultaneously, the mean linear diameter of agglomerates collected from the surface of combustion decreased from 28 to 2 mu m. The results are evidence that the use of energy-producing condensed compositions with nanoaluminum offers much promise for increasing the effectiveness of solid fuel rocket engines.

TI Optimal design of hybrid rocket motors for microgravity platform
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION; COMBUSTION
AB A nested direct/indirect method is used to find the optimal design for a microgravity platform which is based on a hybrid sounding rocket. The direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with the indirect trajectory optimization to maximize a given mission performance index. A gas-pressure feed system is used, with three different propellant combinations. The feed system exploits a pressurizing gas, namely, helium, when hydrogen peroxide or liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant propellant tank pressure. Only self-pressurization is considered with nitrous oxide; two different models are used to describe the behavior of the tank pressurization. The simplest model assumes liquid/vapor equilibrium. A two-phase model is also proposed: Saturated vapor and superheated liquid are considered and the liquid/vapor mass transfer evaluation is based on the liquid spinodal line. Results show that the different tank-pressurization models yield minimal differences of the optimal motor characteristics. Performance differs slightly due to the different mass of the residual oxidizer. The propellant comparison for the present case shows better performance for hydrogen peroxide/ polyethylene with respect to liquid oxygen/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, while nitrous oxide/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene remains attractive for system simplicity and low costs.

AB The dynamics of a simply supported cylindrical shell submerged in liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are considered. The shell itself is bounded by a rigid outer cylinder with closed rigid ends. This configuration gives rise to two fluid-filled cavities-an inner cylindrical cavity. and an outer annular cavity. Such geometries are common in rocket engine design. The natural frequencies and modes of the fluid-structure system are computed by combining the rigid wall acoustic cavity modes and the in vacuo structural modes into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. Eigenvalue veering is observed near the intersections of the curves representing natural frequencies of the rigid wall acoustic and the in vacuo structural modes. In the case of a shell submerged in liquid hydrogen, system frequencies near these intersections are as much as 30% lower than the corresponding in vacuo structural frequencies. Because of its high density, the frequency reductions in the presence of liquid oxygen are even more dramatic. The forced responses of a shell submerged in liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, while subject to a harmonic point excitation, are also presented. The responses in the presence of fluid are found to be quite distinct from those of the structure in vacuo.

AB High-frequency instabilities in liquid propellant rocket engines are experimentally investigated in a model scale research facility. Liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are injected in the combustion chamber at 0.9 MPa through three coaxial injectors vertically aligned. High-amplitude transverse pressure fluctuations are generated in the chamber at frequencies above 1 kHz by a rotating toothed wheel actuator which periodically blocks an auxiliary lateral nozzle. The chamber eigenmodes are identified in a first stage by examining the response of the system to a linear frequency sweep. In a second stage the chamber is excited at the frequency corresponding to the first transverse (1T) mode. The effect of the pressure mode on combustion is observed with intensified and high-speed cameras. Photo-multipliers and pressure sensors are also used to characterize the system behavior and examine phase relations between the corresponding signals. Flame structure modifications observed for specific injection conditions correspond to a strong coupling between acoustics and combustion which notably modifies the flow dynamics, augments the flame expansion rate and enhances heat transfer to the wall.

ID FLAME STABILIZATION
AB A hydrogen gas chiller was designed and fabricated in order to simulate the hydrogen temperature ramping test for liquid rocket engines in a single-element gaseous hydrogen/liquid oxygen combustion chamber. Hot fire PDPA measurements of droplet sizes and velocities as a function of the gaseous hydrogen temperature for a fixed mass flow and shear coaxial injector configuration were obtained as the hydrogen temperature was varied from 130 to 290 K, resulting in a doubling of the hydrogen/oxygen velocity and momentum flux ratios. Measured droplet Sauter and arithmetic mean diameters decreased as the hydrogen temperature increased. However, even though the hydrogen temperature change resulted in a doubling of the velocity and momentum flux ratios, the droplet Sauter mean diameter only decreased by 12.5%. These results indicate that the increase in droplet size as the injected hydrogen temperature is decreased may not be a significant contributor to the resulting combustion instability for liquid rocket engines operating at the conditions examined in this study.

AB This article presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of liquid oxygen (LOX) droplet vaporization in quiescent hydrogen and water environments over a broad range of ambient conditions. The theoretical formulation is based on a complete set of conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species concentrations in a spherically symmetric coordinate. A self-consistent and efficient method for evaluating transport properties and a unified treatment of general fluid thermodynamics are incorporated into an implicit finite-volume numerical scheme. The analysis is further equipped with a water-vapor condensation model for treating the phase change near the droplet surface. The effects of the Dufour and Soret cross-diffusion terms are explored and found to exert negligible influences on the droplet lifetime. Various issues associated with high-pressure droplet vaporization are investigated. In addition, correlations for droplet lifetimes are established for both LOX/hydrogen and LOX/hydrogen/water systems in terms of the initial droplet diameter, reduced critical temperature of oxygen, and thermal conductivities of oxygen and ambient gases.

AB This study aims to obtain the energy from elemental boron burning as solid fuel, which is synthesized from boron minerals, aluminum, iron, and their substances. To obtain the elemental boron from borax, first boric acid (H(3)BO(3)) was obtained from borax decahydrate by using HCl or H(2)SO(4). The boric acid was converted to boron oxide by dehydration process. For reducing the boric acid and the boron oxide into elemental boron, the elemental magnesium, butyl nitrite (C(5)H(9)NO(2)), sawdust, charcoal, and cellulose can be used. As a result, elemental boron obtained by these methods was tested by burning to see whether it was pure. Among these methods, by using the elemental magnesium (Mg) and butyl nitride (C(5)H(9)NO(2)), obtaining elemental boron was more reasonable than the others. The metallic aluminum powder burns to result a strong exothermic reaction in the presence of the magnesium stripe. The manufacture of hydrogen on an industrial scale involves the reaction between steam and iron. The alkali metals, lithium, sodium, and potassium react violently with water at the ambient temperature, yielding hydrogen.

AB Tetra-ol glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) is one of the best candidates for the solid fuel of gas hybrid rocket system because of self-combustibility, better mechanical property and high heat of formation, and comprehensive understanding of combustion phenomena is indispensable for such an application. Combustion model of GAP, which is one-dimensional three-phase mode combustion model, was developed by Beckstead et al. and they applied it to tri-ol GAP successfully. We have applied this model to tetra-ol GAP as an initial attempt, and numerical simulation showed that maximum temperatures in the gas phase exceeded those of experimental results significantly, and calculated burning rates were much higher than strand burner data, thus, modification of the model taking account of combustion incompleteness was found to be necessary. Modifications of combustion model were made taking the residue analysis results into account as Blow off Mechanism. Simulated final temperature in the gas phase and burning rate are lowered effectively and coincide well with experimental data adjusting kinetic parameters.

ID COAXIAL AIRBLAST ATOMIZERS; JET
AB Hydrogen is a widely used rocket fuel and methane is particularly of interest in Europe as a promising substitute for H-2, Experimental investigation of cryogenic reactive coaxial sprays with oxygen as an oxidizer and hydrogen and methane as fuels is conducted to prove whether concepts from the LOX/H-2 injector design can be transferred to LOX/CH4 injection. The liquid oxygen has been atomized in shear coaxial atomizers, and the sprays and flames have been investigated by visualization methods such as shadowgraphy and imaging of the flame emission. LOX sprays are characterized for both propellants by the intact core lengths and droplet numbers, and the combustion is analyzed in terms of the flame anchoring mechanism and the flame spreading angle. The results for LOX/H-2-and LOX/CH4-spray combustion are compared, and the influence of the injection conditions of the propellants on atomization and spray flame is discussed. Significant differences of the sprays and flames have been observed for the two propellant combinations at similar injection conditions, as defined by the Weber number and the momentum flux ratio. The flame stabilization process has shown a strong influence on the atomization and flame characteristics.

AB This paper will describe the history, technology and design features of the XP spaceplane being developed by Rocketplane Ltd. in Oklahoma. The XP is a four seat fighter-sized spaceplane that uses turbojets for takeoff and landing and a liquid oxygen/kerosene rocket engine for main propulsion during its ascent to a 100km apogee suborbital space flight.
   The XP is intended to serve a variety of markets including suborbital tourist flights, intermediate duration microgravity research, remote sensing, astronomy, and microsatellite launch missions. Changes in vehicle configuration and flight profile for serving each of these markets will be described.
   The prototype XP will have its rollout ceremony at the end of 2007 and will begin test flights in early 2008. Commercial space flight operations are expected to begin in fall 2008 with tourist flights and microgravity research flights being the early customer base.
   The spaceplane's flight systems, safety systems, and operating procedures will be reviewed. In addition, key elements of the Rocketplane business and financial model will be discussed. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A spontaneous Raman scattering optical fiber sensor was developed for a specific need of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for long-term detection and monitoring of the purity of liquid oxygen (LO2) in the oxidizer feed line during ground testing of rocket engines. The Raman peak intensity ratios for liquid nitrogen (LN2) and LO2 with varied weight ratios (LN2/LO2) were analyzed for their applicability to impurity sensing. The study of the sensor performance with different excitation light sources has helped to design a miniaturized, cost-effective system for this application. The optimal system response time of this miniaturized sensor for LN2/LO2 measurement was found to be in the range of a few seconds. It will need to be further reduced to the millisecond range for real-time, quantitative monitoring of the quality of cryogenic fluids in a harsh envioronment. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.

The fuel, injected into the combustor through a simple injector, is a mixture of gaseous products, carbon particles, and MgO inert particles that results from the combustion of a solid fuel (HTPB-AP-Mg). The turbulence model used is the realizable k-epsilon model. The adopted reaction model is a reduced kinetic scheme composed of five reactions, three in gaseous phase and two heterogeneous. The model 'finite rate/eddy dissipation model of Magnussen and Hjertager' is used to calculate the production terms in the gas phase, meanwhile the mixed model of Field, Baum, and Street is used for the oxidation reaction of carbon particles.
   After a detailed analysis of the numerical results, obtained with a commercial code for a specific combustor geometry and one set of boundary conditions both for the gaseous and solid phases, the existence of a special combustion pattern is found. It is composed of a turbulent diffusion jet flame attached to the injector, where only the gaseous fuel is burned, followed by a reaction region that envelops the jet of carbon particles at the aft of the combustion chamber. This jet of carbon particles oxidizes at a finite rate producing CO and CO2. The emission of CO and C(s) from the combustor is the main cause of high efficiency reduction.
   Radiation has little effect on calculated global variables, such as efficiency, mass flowrate, and total pressure loss, but on the contrary its effects on the temperature fields became important. Chilling of the gas phase was observed together with a reduction of solid particle temperature, however wall combustor temperature increased greatly.
   Simulation results are interpreted in the light of experimental observations and available numerical solutions in the literature.

AB The near injector combustion zone has been investigated in a coaxially injected liquid rocket engine (LRE) thrust chamber at steady state, high-pressure conditions. Liquid oxygen (LOx) and hydrogen (H-2) are injected via various coaxial injector elements providing a range of representative LRE operating conditions in terms of non-dimensional values. Propellant flow rates are regulated at constant R-OF to achieve combustion pressures below, near and above the thermodynamic critical point of oxygen.
   Optical accessibility is achieved via quartz glass windows which enables the application of high temporal resolution optical diagnostics. Spontaneous OH chemiluminescence presents an indication of the combustion zone whilst shadowgraph imaging provides a visual representation of the core and coaxial flow field.
   Results from an extensive test series highlight that reduced pressure (P-r) has a significant influence on propellant flow field evolution and the entire combustion process in a LRE thrust chamber. Strong qualitative trends previously observed at elevated pressure are further validated through detailed analysis of measurement data and the application of various image-processing techniques. The influence of reduced pressure is quantified based on LOx-spray evolution, assessment of flame emission intensity measurements and the efficiency and roughness of combustion.

AB Induced swirl flow has proved to be an effective way of increasing the residence time of oxidizer in the solid fuel of hybrid rocket motor. For the present study, both experimental and numerical studies have been conducted in order to investigate the effect of both swirl injector and helical configuration of the grain (represented by a pitch number) on the enhancement of regression rate. The results showed that a higher regression rate can be achieved in the case of pitch 6 than in the case of pitch 100 when either no swirl or substantially strong swirl is imposed at the inlet. However, the regression rate in the case of pitch 100 showed even further increase than as observed in pitch 6 if a moderate strength of swirl is imposed. This is believed not only due to an increase in residence time of oxidizer flow but also due to modified flow structures resulted from the interaction of the inlet swirl and the geometric configuration of pitch 100. Thus, it was concluded that a proper combination of helical configuration with large pitch number and a moderate inlet swirl can produce the condition for achieving the maximum regression rate. Numerical calculations with RANS type turbulence model supported the experimental findings that the pitch 100 is more effective in maintaining the rotational component of momentum flux all the way up to the port exit than the pitch 6 when a swirl is imposed. Also calculation result suggests that a less pressure drop is involved in the pitch 100. Nevertheless, more detailed flow information such as turbulence statistics and residence time will be required for the better understanding of the role of swirl and helical configuration and, thus, it would be desirable to perform a DNS or LES type computation.

AB A hybrid-ramjet uses liquid fuel and solid fuel. The high ignitability of the secondary combustion and high combustion stability which a solid fuel ramjet (a ducted rocket) has, and the high Isp performance and the wide fuel flow control range which a liquid fuel ramjet has are expected on this engine. The liquid fuel is injected into the secondary burning region of the gasificated solid fuel. That is why the secondary combustion characteristics depend on that of the mode using only solid fuel. Solid fuels, which contain B, were made. It is considered suitable material for a hybrid ramjet engine solid fuel. And combustion tests were conducted with them using only solid fuel. Both primary combustion and secondary combustion and secondary combustion characteristics are good. The secondary combustion efficiency was improved by the air induction method change etc.

DT Article
DE helium injection; sub-cooling; diffusion; liquid oxygen
AB Sub-cooling of cryogenic propellant by helium injection is one of the most effective methods for suppressing bulk boiling and keeping sub-cooled liquid oxygen before rocket launch. Compared with the helium injection cooling under atmospheric condition, helium injection cooling under pressurized condition has advantage that it can greatly reduce re-warming time of the sub-cooled liquid oxygen. Helium injection cooling under pressurized condition is characterized by cooling of initially sub-cooled cryogenic liquid, which is significantly different from that of the atmospheric condition where liquid oxygen usually exists at saturated condition. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of helium injection cooling under pressurized condition, with the associated physical understanding of the process. Experimental results are presented along the simulations of variously combined system parameters based on the finite heat transfer and instantaneous diffusion mass transfer model. A non-dimensional parameter for identifying the cooling regime is conceived. The critical values of the non-dimensional parameters and injected helium temperatures are also estimated.

AB The characteristics of propellant mixing near the injector have a profound effect on liquid rocket engine performance. Injector element geometry and propellant momentum are the only parameters available to control such mixing. A multiphase flow combustion model utilizing propellant real-fluid properties was developed to predict the mixing and thermal environment created by element configurations. The multiphase model was incorporated into a mature computational fluid dynamics code that can be used, to simulate the flowfield near the injector and to analyze the combustion chamber and nozzle, wall heating. The validity of the present model and code was investigated by comparing predictions to test data for two liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen unielement shear coaxial injector and two cryogenic nitrogen jet injection experiments. These simulations and those of several other investigators were critically compared at the 2nd International Workshop on Rocket Combustion Modeling. Based on these comparisons, it appears that the present model is a good, computationally efficient approximation of liquid rocket injector flows for both subcritical and supercritical spray combustion.

AB Based on the experimental observations using a liquid-gas coaxial injector with fairly dense liquid injection, an empirical calculation model of the breakup length of a liquid jet was derived. It is based on the one-dimensional momentum conservation equation for two-phase flow, as well as on the critical Eotvos number, which was derived experimentally by the author in a previous study. This model was applied to evaluate the local stripping rate of the liquid mass at the interaction surface between a liquid and a gas, and was applied to calculate the size of the formed droplets. Comparisons of the mean droplet size, distribution histogram of the size, and breakup length of the liquid jet were made with experimental data. This calculation model was also applied to evaluate the characteristics of the rocket injectors chosen as candidates for the LE-5, the liquid oxygen/hydrogen engine of the second stage of the Japanese H-1 launcher.

The main purpose is to drastically reduce the cost of rocket experiments and thus, attract potential users such as metrological and microgravity researchers. A key idea is a new fuel grain design to accelerate the gasification rate of solid fuel. The new fuel grain design, designated as CAMUI as an abbreviation of "cascaded multistage impinging-jet", is that the gas flow repeatedly collides with the solid fuel surface to accelerate the heat transfer to the fuel. To install a regenerative cooling system using cryogenic liquid oxygen as coolant in a small launcher, the authors devised a valveless supply system (with no valves in the liquid oxygen flow line). Four serial successful launch verification tests by 10kg vehicle equipped with a 50kgf thrust CAMUI motor have shown the feasibility of the motor system. The meteorological observation model of 400kgf class motor is under development and the development of microgravity experiment class of 1.5-2tonf motor will follow subsequently.

AB High-frequency combustion oscillations are investigated experimentally. The combustor fed by cryogenic propellants operates under elevated pressure conditions (p(c) = 0.9 MPa) and is equipped with three coaxial injectors fed by liquid oxygen and gaseous methane. Injection parameters are in the typical range used in rocket engines. This experiment simulates on a model scale conditions prevailing in such systems, but full similarity is not achieved. The chamber exhibits a set of resonant modes with eigenfrequencies above 1 kHz. The study focuses on high-frequency dynamics resulting from a strong coupling between one of the transverse modes and combustion. The combustor is forced with an external actuator. The eigenmodes are identified with a linear frequency sweep, and then the system is modulated at the first transverse resonant frequency. The flame motion and response are observed with a high speed and two intensified charge-coupled-device cameras recording phase-conditioned images. In a set of experiments carried out on the multiple-injector combustor, operating conditions were changed systematically to determine parameter ranges leading to combustion sensitivity to transverse excitation. Strong coupling is observed in this way with a spectacular modification of the flame spread. Emission from the three flames is notably intensified when this coupling occurs, whereas thermocouples placed on the lateral walls detect a rapid increase in temperature. The OH* emission intensity that can be linked to the heat-release rate is increased. A phase analysis indicates that the pressure and OH* emission oscillate transversally and in phase at the modulation frequency. This behavior is also observed with the high-speed camera, which also features enhanced reactive vortices convected in the downstream direction at a lower frequency.

AB An analytical optimization and evaluation approach is presented for sizing a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen, single-stage-to-orbit system. The approach uses a unique merging of historical data for weight relationships, Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty analysis, technology factors, thermochemical analysis, and genetic algorithm solvers for concept optimization. The. method models and optimizes engine chamber pressure, area ratio, and oxidizer/fuel ratio to determine the best vehicle design based on seven separate cost/weight figures of merit Model results show that a 53% increase in design, development, test, and evaluation cost results in a 67% reduction in gross liftoff weight. The uncertainty range for the design, development, test, and evaluation costs is shown to be from -45 to +76% of the mean value for the 95th percentile uncertainty case. The oxidizer/fuel ratio has a significant impact on the overall weight of the vehicle and vehicle components due to the large percentage of the gross liftoff weight that is dedicated to propellants. Other results show the effects of propulsion parameters, technology factors, and cost factors on weight and cost under different overall design constraints.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents a new design methodology for efficient conceptual design of complex systems involving multidisciplinary and computationally intensive analysis with large number of design variables. A nearly-orthogonal sampling of design space is proposed with good space filling properties to extract maximum useful information about system behavior using much lower number of trial designs. This sampled data is then used as training data for artificial neural network, which will act as a metamodel to represent the time consuming disciplinary analyses. A stage-wise interconnection of separate neural networks is also proposed for trajectory metamodel to offset dimensionality curse of neural networks. Genetic Algorithm performs global optimization by utilizing this metamodel and subsequently sequential quadratic programming performs the local optimization utilizing exact analyses. The performance of proposed methodology is investigated in this paper for the conceptual design optimization of multistage solid fueled space launch vehicle. The results show excellent approximation of highly non-linear functions using proposed sampling and drastic reduction in overall design optimization time, due to greatly reduced number of exact disciplinary analyses.

AB Sub-cooling of cryogenic propellant by helium injection is one of the most effective methods for suppressing bulk boiling and keeping sub-cooled liquid oxygen before rocket launch. In order to design the cooling system, understanding of the limitations of heat and mass transfer is required. In this paper, an analytical model for the helium injection system is presented. This model's main feature is the representation of bubbling system using finite-rate heat transfer and instantaneous mass transfer concept. With this simplified approach, the effect of helium injection to liquid oxygen system under several circumstances is examined. Experimental results along with simulations of single bubble rising in liquid oxygen and bubbling system are presented with various helium injection flow rates, helium temperatures, and injection methods. The overall cooling effect for rocket application is also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article deals with the application of OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) to the study of high-pressure cryogenic flames (p = 6.3 MPa). It is shown that this optical diagnostic provides good-quality data and can be used to examine the flame structure in the injector near-field. High-pressure conditions require a careful choice of excitation wavelength based on a detailed analysis of the absorption coefficient dependence on pressure and temperature. It is particularly important to consider line-broadening and central-frequency-shifting effects induced by high-pressure operation. PLIF is used to examine jet flames formed by a single coaxial injector fed by liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen (LOx/GH(2)) in subcritical and transcritical regimes. In the latter case, the liquid oxygen temperature is below its critical value while its pressure is above critical (T-LOx = 85 K < TC (02) = 150 K, PLO, = 6.3 MPa > Pc(02) = 5.04 MPa). Such transcritical conditions prevail in many high-performance devices such as liquid-propellant rocket engines. A detailed understanding of this type of combustion is necessary to the development of improved and more reliable propulsion systems. PLIF provides images that may be considered to represent instantaneous distributions of OH radicals and may be used to infer the structure and position of the flame. An optical multichannel analyzer is also used in the experiments to ensure that the detected signals have the expected spectral features. Fluorescence spectra are also compared with emission spectra synthesized with Lifbase in terms of line positions and broadening. Mean flame positions deduced from PLIF images are shown to nearly match those deduced from the Abel transformed average OH* light-emission distributions. The difference is related to a biased estimate of the flame position resulting from the Abel transformed emission data. PLIF is also used to examine the flame edge. It is known from a previous analysis of the flame-holding mechanism that the low-speed wake established just behind the oxygen injector lip and generated by the two propellants must be thicker than the flame-edge thickness to ensure stable anchoring. PLIF images indicate that the flame thickness is on the order of the wake transverse size. When the thickness exceeds this transverse dimension it is found that the flame becomes sensitive to the high-speed hydrogen stream. Finally, the instantaneous PLIF images of OH included in this article may serve as a guide to current efforts directed at the large-eddy simulation of transcritical combustion.

AB A detailed understanding of liquid propellant combustion is necessary for the development of improved and more reliable propulsion systems. This article describes experimental investigations aimed at providing such a fundamental basis for design and engineering of combustion components. It reports recent applications of imaging techniques to cryogenic combustion at high pressure. The flame structure is investigated in the transcritical range where the pressure exceeds the critical pressure of oxygen (p > p(c)(O-2 = 5.04 MPa)) but the temperature of the injected liquid oxygen is below its critical value (T-O2 < T-c(O-2) = 154K. Data obtained from imaging of OH* radicals emission, CH* radicals emission in the case of LOx/GCH(4) flames and backlighting provide a detailed view of the flame structure for a set of injection conditions. The data may be used to guide numerical modelling of transcritical flames and the theoretical and numerical analysis of the stabilization process. Calculations of the flame edge are used to illustrate this aspect. Results obtained may also be employed to devise engineering modelling tools and methodologies for component development aimed at improved efficiency and augmented reliability.

AB This paper provides an overview of recent advances in the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of cryogenic fluid injection and mixing in transcritical and supercritical environments. The basis of the analysis is a general theoretical and numerical framework that accommodates full conservation laws and real-fluid thermodynamic and transport phenomena. All of the thermophysical properties are determined directly from fundamental thermodynamics theories, along with the use of corresponding-state principles. Turbulence closure is achieved using a large-eddy-simulation technique, in which large-scale motions are calculated explicitly and the effects of unresolved small-scale turbulence are modeled either analytically or empirically. The analysis has been applied to study: (1) fluid jet dynamics, (2) swirl injection of liquid oxygen through a simplex swirl injector, and (3) shear co-axial injection and mixing of liquid oxygen and methane. Various effects, including density stratification, shear-layer instability, volume dilatation, and property variations, dictating the evolution of cryogenic jets and mixing layers, are identified and analyzed in depth. The jet dynamics are found to be largely determined by the local thermodynamic state through its influence on the thermophysical properties of the fluid. The impact of injector configuration and operating conditions on the swirl injector behavior are also highlighted. These results not only shed light on the subject problems, but also provide a quantitative basis for identifying the design parameters and flow variables that exert the strongest influence on the underlying processes.

AB Perchlorate, a known thyroid endocrine disruptor, contaminates Surface waters near military instillations where solid fuel rocket motors are manufactured or assembled. To assess potential perchlorate exposure to fish and the human Population which may feed on them, fish were collected around the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in McLennan County, TX, and analyzed for the presence of the perchlorate anion. The sampling sites included Lake Waco and Belton Lake, and several streams and rivers within their watersheds. The general tendency was that perchlorate was only found in a few species sampled.. and perchlorate was not detected in every individual within these species. When detected in the fish, perchlorate tissue concentrations were greater than that in the water. This may be due to highly variable perchlorate concentrations in the water coupled with individual-level variation in elimination from the body, or to routes of exposure other than water.

ID DESIGN
AB Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tanks represent an important percentage of net weight and cost of any reusable launch vehicle (RLV). Moreover they play structural and thermal and propulsive roles at the same time. The transition from metal to composite material is then considered an obliged choice. In this study, a FEM optimisation procedure has been developed in order to both increase payload (by decreasing tank mass) and improve aerodynamic and controllability (by increasing global flexural stiffness). The optimisation of these two contradictory objectives have been obtained using a standard FE numerical tool within an innovative optimisation procedure, as a possible alternative to genetic algorithm approaches [Jaunky N, Knight NF, Ambur DR. Optimal design of general stiffened composite circular cylinders for global buckling with strength constraints. Compos Struct 1998;41:243-52. [1]]. The key features of this procedure are: the starting point determination methodology; a sensitivity analysis based on an integration between the classical laminate theory and the netting theory to validate the FE optimiser results; the strategy of choice of the best compromise solution in terms of design constraints and objective function.

AB A comprehensive dynamic model of a hybrid rocket has been developed to understand and predict the transient behavior including instabilities. A linearized version of the transient model predicted the low-frequency chamber pressure oscillations that are commonly observed in hybrids. The source of the instabilities is based on a complex coupling of thermal transients in the solid fuel, the wall heat transfer blocking due to fuel regression rate, and the transients in the boundary layer that forms on the fuel surface. The oscillation frequencies predicted by the linearized theory are in very good agreement with 43 motor test results obtained from the hybrid propulsion literature. The motor test data used in the comparison cover a very wide spectrum of parameters including 1) four separate research and development programs; 2) three different oxidizers (liquid oxygen, gaseous oxygen, and nitrous oxide); 3) a wide range of motor dimensions, that is, from 5 in. (12.7 cm) diameter to 72 in. (182.9 cm) diameter, and operating conditions; and 4) several fuel formulations. A simple universal scaling formula for the frequency of the primary oscillation mode is also suggested.

AB Many studies have been conducted to increase regression rate of solid fuel in hybrid rocket. One of them resorts to swirl flow since it can extend the residence time of oxidizer in the fuel grain. Also, metal wires may lead to increase the regression rate of solid fuel as shown in solid propellants. In this study, a series of experiments was designed to investigate the enhancement of regression rate of solid fuel by embedded metal wires and by fuel port grain. And fuel port was designed with a helical configuration to attempt to induce swirl flow. PMMA with gaseous oxygen is the solid fuel used for investigation. Test results showed that embedded metal wires turned out to be ineffective method because only 3-4% increases in regression rate were observed. However, fuel port grain configuration yields higher burning performance of up to 50% increase in regression rate. Also pitch number as well as total impulse was found to be a design variable.

ID SOLID-FUEL RAMJET; HEAT-TRANSFER; COMBUSTION
AB A series of firing tests was carried out to investigate the influence of the oxidizer injection on the solid fuel regression rate behavior in a hybrid rocket engine. For this purpose, a conical subsonic nozzle as the injector of the gaseous oxidizer was selected to generate nonuniform conditions at the entrance of the fuel port. Gaseous oxygen and polyethylene fuel cylindrical grains were used. When the oxygen was fed by this kind of injector, the fuel regression in the region of the oxygen impingement on the grain's surface was increased several times, which led to irregular fuel consumption with the characteristic afterburn port shape typical of solid fuel ramjets having a rearward-facing step at the air inlet. The local instantaneous regression rates, measured by means of the ultrasound pulse-echo technique, showed regression rate-time profiles strongly dependent on the geometric configuration and helped to explain the complex regression phenomenon deriving from the impingement zone displacement during the time. Empirical correlations for the prediction of the average regression rate were developed taking into account the influence of mass flux, pressure, and port diameter. Finally, a nondimensional semi-empirical correlation involving the effect of the blowing number yielded improved accuracy.

AB Perchlorate, an iodide uptake inhibitor, is increasingly being detected in new places and new matrices. Perchlorate contamination has been attributed largelyto the manufacture and use of ammonium perchlorate (the oxidizer in solid fuel rockets) and/or the earlier use of Chilean nitrate as fertilizer (similar to 0.1% perchlorate). However, there are regions such as the southern high plains (Texas Panhandle) where there is no clear historical or current evidence of the extensive presence of rocket fuel or Chilean fertilizer sources. The occurrence of easily measurable concentrations of perchlorate in such places is difficult to understand. In the southern high plains groundwater, perchlorate is better correlated with iodate, known to be of atmospheric origin, compared to any other species. WE show that perchlorate is readily formed by a variety of simulated atmospheric processes. For example, it is formed from chloride aerosol by electrical discharge and by exposing aqueous chloride to high concentrations of ozone. We report that perchlorate is present in many rain and snow samples. This strongly suggests that some perchlorate is formed in the atmosphere and a natural perchlorate background of atmospheric origin should exist.

AB Acting as a virtual first stage, a hypervelocity launch together with the use of frozen hydrogen/frozen oxygen propellant, offers a Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) system that promises an enormous increase in SSTO mass-ratio. Ram acceleration provides hypervelocity (approximate to2 km/sec) to the orbital vehicle with a gas gun supplying the initial velocity required for ram operation. The vehicle itself acts as the center body of a ramjet inside a launch tube, filled with gaseous fuel and oxidizer, acting as an engine cowling. The high acceleration needed to achieve hypervelocity precludes a crew, and it would require greatly increased liquid fuel tank structural mass if a liquid propellant is used for post-launch vehicle propulsion. Solid propellants do not require as much fuel-chamber strengthening to withstand a hypervelocity launch as do liquid propellants, but traditional solid fuels have lower exhaust velocities than liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen. The shock-stability of frozen hydrogen/frozen oxygen propellant has been experimentally demonstrated. A hypervelocity launch system using frozen hydrogen/frozen oxygen propellant would be a revolutionary new development in spaceflight.

AB To track the three-dimensional behavior of liquid surfaces in storage tanks on orbit, a numerical scheme based on the level set method was developed. For the verification of the numerical methods, experimental data were acquired through the observation of the unsteady deformations of liquid surfaces in cylindrical containers under low-gravity conditions in a drop tower. Primary emphasis was placed on the dynamic behavior of the liquid surface and the displacement of the contact line on the solid wall. Based on the results, the boundary condition for surface tension was discussed and the model of wetting phenomena was adequately introduced into the computation. Compared with the experimental data, the corresponding numerical results showed good agreement. With the developed code, the flowfields at the draining process in the liquid oxygen (LOchi) tank for the upper-stage propulsion system of an H-IIA launch vehicle under low-gravity conditions were also investigated. It was found that the buoyancy induced by a slight acceleration was efficient to prevent dip growth and that the serviceable propellant in the launch-vehicle tank could thereby be increased in a realistic situation.

AB Prediction of the regression rate of polymeric fuels is important, especially for the optimal design of solid fuel ramjets or hybrid rocket motors. The burning surface temperature and the surface activation energy in the Arrhenius pyrolysis equation are required for prediction of the regression rate. As a typical polymeric fuel, polymethylinethacrylate (PMMA) was chosen for the present study. The burning surface temperature of PMMA was measured for both end-burning and sandwich-burning experimental devices. In the end-burning experiment, the oxygen flow impinged on the top of the specimen to burn the PMMA. In the sandwich-burning experiment, PMMA sheets were sandwiched between AP pellets. Temperature profiles near the burning surface were measured with a thermocouple embedded in the specimen. Simultaneously. the emergence of the thermocouple from the burning surface was determined with a video camera. The burning surface temperature obtained in the present Study was found to be almost independent of the regression rate. The Surface activation energy of PMMA was more than 1000 kJ/mol. Our measured surface temperature or the activation energy differs from the values measured with a thermocouple in previous studies. This difference probably is a result of mistaken identification of the burning surface temperature in the previous Studies. because it was found that the sudden change or tiny plateau of the slope, in the temperature profile of PMMA, did not signal the burning surface.

AB Injection of liquid fluid initially at subcritical temperature into an environment in which the temperature and pressure exceed the thermodynamic critical conditions is an important phenomenon in many high performance devices like liquid propellant rocket engines. This is found, for example, in the Space Shuttle main engines or in the Ariane 5 Vulcain engine both operating with liquid oxygen (LOx) and gaseous hydrogen (GH(2)). This article is concerned with the less standard situation where both reactants are in a transcritical state. One case of current interest in propulsion, that of combustion of cryogenic oxygen and methane injected at high pressure, is investigated experimentally. A coaxial injector delivers oxygen at a temperature of 85 K and methane at 120 or 288 K. The pressure in the chamber takes values between 4.5 and 6 MPa. Emission images from excited state OH (A(2)Sigma, denoted OH*) and CH (A(2)Delta, denoted CH*) are recorded and averaged. The Abel transform is used to determine the mean flame structure from these average images. Data indicate that the flame is stabilized in the vicinity of the injector. When both propellants are transcritical, the flame features two conical regions of light emission, one spreading close to the liquid oxygen boundary and the other located further away from the axis near the liquid methane boundary. The outer flame boundary is also conical with a relatively large expansion angle. This flame structure notably differs from that observed when one of the propellants is injected in a suberitical or transcritical state while the other is gaseous. An analysis of the relevant characteristic times suggests that under transcritical conditions the rate of combustion is mainly controlled by turbulent energy transfer to the propellants. This determines the mass fluxes from the dense regions to the lighter gaseous streams governing the rate of conversion into products. (c) 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB With regard to the development of a liquid-fuel rocket engine, knowledge of unsteady characteristics of turbopumps is essential in attempts to increase rocket reliability. Numerical simulation is very advantageous in determining the unsteady characteristics of turbopumps, and knowledge thus obtained can contribute to decreasing the cost and the number of experiments. In the present study, the effect of compressibility of cryogenic propellants, such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX), and the effect of nonlinearity of flow on the dynamic response of a high-pressure turbopump were considered. The results of calculation were compared with a nonlinear incompressible mathematical model. The effects of dynamic characteristics of a cavitating inducer, such as cavitation compliance and mass flow gain factor, as well as the effect of pipe elasticity and that of an accumulator for the POGO suppressor, were also analyzed.

AB The dueled rocket is a supersonic flight propulsion system that takes the exhaust from a solid fuel gas generator, mixes it with air, and burns it to produce thrust. To develop such systems, the use of numerical models based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been increasing, but to date only simplified treatments of the combustion within ducted rockets have been reported, likely due to the difficulties in characterizing and accurately modeling the partially reacted, particle-laden fuel exhaust from the gas generator. Through a careful examination of the governing equations and experimental measurements, a CFD-based methodology that properly accounts for the influence of the gas generator exhaust, particularly the solid phase, has now been developed to predict the performance of a dueled rocket combustor using a simulated solid fuel. It uses an equilibrium-chemistry probability density function combustion model with two separate streams, one gaseous and the other of 75-nm-diam carbon spheres, to represent the exhaust products from the gas generator. After extensive validation with direct-connect combustion experiments over a wide range of geometries and test conditions, this CFD-based method was able to predict, within a good degree of accuracy, the combustion efficiency of a dueled rocket combustor.

AB In most cryogenic liquid rocket engines, liquid oxygen manifold and injector are not thermally insulated from room temperature environment for the purpose of reducing system complexity and weight. This feature of cryogenic liquid supply system results in the situation that liquid oxygen flow is vaporized especially in the vicinity of the manifold and the injector wall. The transient two-phase flow tendency is severe for low combustion pressure rocket engine Without using turbo-pump. This paper focuses on the two-phase flow phenomena of liquid oxygen in low combustion pressure rocket engine. The KSR-III (Korea Sounding Rocket) engine test data is thoroughly analyzed to estimate the vapor fraction of liquid oxygen flow near the engine manifold and the injector. During the cold flow and the combustion tests of the KSR-III Engine, the static and dynamic pressures are measured at the engine inlet, the liquid oxygen manifold and the combustion chamber. The manifold outer wall and the inner wall temperatures are also measured. In this paper, we present the experimental investigation on the vapor generation, the vapor mass fraction, and the boiling characteristics of the liquid oxygen flow in the engine manifold and injector.

AB Boron was chosen as fuel in view of its excellent thermodynamic values for combustion, as compared to traditional fuels. The problem of the boron in combustion is the formation of a surface layer of oxide, which delays the ignition process, reducing the performance of the rocket engine. This paper presents a high-energy fuel for rocket engines. It is composed of sintered boron (borides and carbides and vitreous compounds) with a reducing chemical agent. Borides and boron carbide were prepared since the combustion heat of the latter is similar to that of the amorphous boron (in: K.K. Kuo (Ed.), Boron-Based Solid Propellant and Solid Fuel, Vol. 427, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1993). Several chemical reducing elements were used, such as aluminum, magnesium, and coke. As the raw material for boron, different compounds were used: amorphous boron, boric acid and boron oxide. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB SKYLON is a single stage to orbit (SSTO) winged spaceplane designed to give routine low cost access to space. At a gross takeoff weight of 275 tonnes of which 220 tonnes is propellant the vehicle is capable of placing 12 tonnes into an equatorial low Earth orbit. The vehicle configuration consists of a slender fuselage containing the propellant tankage and payload bay with delta wings located midway along the fuselage carrying the SABRE engines in axisymmetric nacelles on the wingtips. The vehicle takes off and lands horizontally on it's own undercarriage. The fuselage is constructed as a multilayer structure consisting of aeroshell, insulation, structure and tankage. SKYLON employs extant or near term materials technology in order to minimise development cost and risk. The SABRE engines have a dual mode capability. In rocket mode the engine operates as a closed cycle liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen high specific impulse rocket engine. In airbreathing mode (from takeoff to Mach 5) the liquid oxygen flow is replaced by atmospheric air, increasing the installed specific impulse 3-6 fold. The airflow is drawn into the engine via a 2 shock axisymmetric intake and cooled to cryogenic temperatures prior to compression. The hydrogen fuel flow acts as a heat sink for the closed cycle helium loop before entering the main combustion chamber.

ID COMBUSTION; CHEMISTRY
AB A counterflow diffusion flame between gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOx) is studied numerically at I and 2 bar pressures. Conditions at the liquid interface are modelled using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation and the species profiles are evaluated with a one-dimensional numerical code. Complex chemistry and multicomponent transport are employed. Thermodynamic and transport properties are taken from Chemkin and the corresponding Transport packages. Typical species and temperature profiles are presented. The extinction strain rate is evaluated as a function of the inlet hydrogen temperature. This varies from 1.2 X 10(5) s(-1) at a hydrogen temperature of 20K to 6.0 X 10(5) s(-1) at a temperature of 310K, indicating that hydrogen/LOx flames are extremely resistant to strain rate. The effect of the temperature gradient on the liquid side of the interface is examined and found to be negligible. When applied to one aspect of the flame-holding in cryogenic rocket motors, these results may be used to infer that extinction by strain rate is improbable in the injector near-field, even for very low hydrogen stream temperatures.

   instability; negative heat release; thermal inertia of solid fuel
AB Hybrid rocket combustion has a manifestation of stable response to the perturbations compared to solid propellant combustion. Recently, it has revealed that the low frequency combustion instability about 10 Hz was occurred mainly due to thermal inertia of solid fuel. In this paper, the combustion response function was theoretically derived by use of ZN(Zeldovich-Novozhilov) method. The result with HTPB/LOX combination showed a quite good agreement in response function with previous works and could predict the low frequency oscillations with a peak around 10 Hz which was observed experimentally. Also, it was found that the amplification region in the frequency domain is independent of the regression rate exponent n but showed the dependence of activation energy. Moreover, the response function has shown that the hybrid combustion system was stable due to negative heat release of solid fuel for vaporization, even though the addition of energetic ingredients such as AP and Al could lead to increase heat release at the fuel surface.

AB Operating conditions and performances of a fixed-geometry combined-cycle engine for a single-stage-to-orbit aerospace plane were calculated with a simple simulation model. With the flow conditions calculated with the model, the cooling requirement of the engine and pitching moment of the plane were investigated. The engine was composed of an ejector-jet mode, a ramjet mode, a scramjet mode, and a rocket mode. The engine had a fixed geometry in its operation. Subsonic combustion was conducted with no second throat in the combustor under the ejector-jet mode and the ramjet mode. Propellants were liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The coolant flow rate became larger than the fuel flow rate. The excessive flow rate decreased the specific impulse above Mach 9 and restricted application of the airbreathing engine mode up to Mach 11. The pitching moment of the plane would be balanced even in the space in the configuration with the combined-cycle engine mounted on the windward surface.

DE axially symmetric solenoid; liquid oxygen (LOX); magnetic force;
   paramagnetic fluids
AB Current technology for pumping liquid oxygen (LOX)-the corrosive, highly explosive, cryogenic fluid used as the oxidizing agent in many space launch vehicles-involves traditional mechanisms such as impellers and rotors. The moving parts that are in contact with the fluid, as well as the seals around the pump, are potential failure points. These parts require special attention to protect against a reaction with LOX. We have developed a method to use pulsed magnetic fields to pump finite quantities of LOX that requires no moving parts in contact with the fluid. The equipment for this pumping technology is potentially nonintrusive and may be lighter in weight than existing mechanical pumps. Here, we compute equations of motion using a finite-difference technique, predicting the movement of a finite-length column of LOX in response to a pulsed magnetic field. We compare the calculated dynamics to experiment for various configurations.

ID SPECTROSCOPY
AB Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) has been used to investigate high pressure cryogenic liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (LOX/GH(2)) flames at pressures up to 6.5 MPa. The method employs two synchronized broadband CARS systems to probe simultaneously H-2 and H2O. Temperature is deduced from the H-2 and H2O CARS profiles while the H20 concentration is deduced from the modulation from the resonant the H2O resonant signal superimposed on the nonresonant background signal. Details of the modeling of the CARS spectra at high pressure and the data reduction are discussed. Problems issued from the presence of liquid phase are also investigated. The results demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of CARS for investigating cryogenic combustion under representative rocket model combustor regimes where the pressure range is above the supercritical condition (P > 5.04 MPa).

AB In the field of dynamics for a dusty fluid, the volume of the dust particles and flow behaviour of particles in different conditions is very important in engineering problems such as atmospheric fallout, nuclear reactor, powder technology, performance of solid fuel rocket nozzles, air craft icing and so many others. An analysis is presented in this paper to study the effects of thermal dispersion and Viscous dissipation on unsteady flow of a viscous incompressible dusty gas through a hexagonal channel of uniform cross section under the influence of magnetic field and time dependent pressure gradient. The results show the change in velocity profile of gas and particles in the presence of magnetic field with time, thermal dispersion and volume fraction phi. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Radiative heat transfer in film-cooled liquid rocket engine nozzles
SO JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER
LA English
DT Article
ID ENCLOSURES
AB A radiation model has been implemented in a Navier-Stokes flow solver to investigate the importance of thermal radiation in film-cooled liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket engine thrust chambers. Two running conditions were computed: high-altitude and sea-level conditions. For high altitudes, the smalls are heated by radiation approximately 3 K, and the flow is not influenced. At sea level, the flow separates from the nozzle walls and a Mach disk is formed inside the nozzle. This extra source of radiation is clearly observable and, combined with the cold atmospheric air pocket created behind the separation, contributes importantly to the wall temperatures. An increase of up to 140 K is observed in the zone after the separation. Moreover, the position of the shock is slightly affected by radiative transfer. It is shown that radiative heat transfer does play an important role in the case of a shocked film-cooled nozzle. In the unshocked case, its effects are noticeable, but may be neglected.

AB Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) was applied for temperature measurements in a high-pressure cryogenic liquid oxygen-hydrogen rocket model combustor. The combustor was operated at 6 MPa, above the supercritical pressure of the propellants. H-2 and H2O molecules were probed simultaneously using a dual-broadband CARS setup and degenerate CARS setup with a single dye laser. The diagnostic set-up at the test site was adapted to the high level of vibrations experienced during tests by several measures: the laser system was positioned in a separate room next to the test cell, a heavy-duty tri-axial translation stage for positioning the beam guiding optics and focusing lenses in the test cell was specially designed to be insensitive to vibrational excitation. The combustor was operated at two hydrogen injection temperatures, 65 and 117 K. In the low hydrogen temperature tests no CARS signal could be obtained. At a higher hydrogen temperature (similar to117 K), successful temperature mapping of the flame was performed at two cross-sections, 50 and 80 rum downstream of the injector. Bimodal temperature distributions were observed at the 80 mm position, indicating strong flame and flow oscillations. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Ultrasonic testing is widely used in detection of disbonds in multilayer structures such as solid fuel rocket motors, which consist of steel, rubber laminate, and solid fuel. However, only a small fraction of ultrasonic waves can transmit through the steel-rubber interface because of their large difference in acoustical impedance. Very little ultrasound is reflected back by the weak bond interface within the rubber laminate or from the interface between the rubber and solid fuel. Consequently, the interface bond degradation can only produce a very slight variation in the received ultrasonic echo sequences, which are too weak to be detected effectively. In this paper, ultrasonic pulse reflection from the interfaces is considered to evaluate the interface bond condition. A multilayer model with spring boundary condition is used to describe the weak bond, and ultrasonic reflection response is obtained for the structure in the immersion mode. After analysis of the ultrasonic echo sequences of the steel-rubber structure, the segment adaptive filtering method is used to separate the simulated echo sequences and to obtain the interface signals. With the separated interface signals, the weak bond of all the interfaces, including the one within the rubber laminate, can be detected. The procedure has been applied to signals measured from the steel-rubber samples, and the amplitude and envelope of various interface signals agree well with those from the corresponding simulated signal. The disbond and weak bond can be detected and evaluated by the amplitude of corresponding signal of interfaces.

TI Pioneer Rocketplane conceptual design study
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
AB The Pioneer Rocketplane is a two-seat, F-111-sized aircraft powered by turbofan engines and a kerosene/oxygen-burning RD-120 rocket engine that, using an expendable upper stage, boosts a 3000-lb satellite to a circular low Earth orbit. The Rocketplane takes off with its turbofan engines and climbs to approximately 20,000 ft, where it meets a tanker aircraft, taking on about 48,000 lb of kerosene jet fuel. The Rocketplane then moves to a second tanker aircraft, where it takes on about 130,000 lb of liquid oxygen. After disconnecting from the tanker, the vehicle ignites its rocket engine and climbs to an altitude of 70 miles. Although never reaching orbit itself, the Rocketplane is outside the sensible atmosphere. It opens its payload bay doors and releases the upper stage, which ignites and delivers the satellite payload to its intended low Earth orbit. The doors are then closed, and the aircraft reenters the atmosphere and lands. The second phase conceptual design study is described in which prior configuration design and optimization studies have been integrated into a viable baseline air vehicle concept on which performance analysis is conducted.

AB A series of static engine firings were conducted to investigate the solid-fuel regression rate behavior and operating characteristics of vortex hybrid rocket engines. The vortex hybrid engine configuration is characterized by a coaxial, coswirling, counterflowing vortex combustion field in a cylindrical fuel port. To generate this flowfield, oxidizer is injected through a swirl injector located between the aft end of the fuel grain and the inlet to the converging portion of the exit nozzle. Test firings with thrusts up to 960 N were conducted with gaseous oxygen and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid fuel. Average fuel regression rates up to seven times larger than those in similar classical hybrids were measured. Empirical correlations were developed to describe accurately the experimental regression rates over more than an order of magnitude variation in mass flux. In addition to local mass flux and oxygen injection velocity, geometric engine variables, such as engine contraction ratio and length-to-diameter ratio, had a significant influence on the measured regression rates. Nondimensional regression rate and heat transfer correlations were also developed. Throttling and restart capability were demonstrated.

TI Combustion of liquefying hybrid propellants: Part 1, general theory
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID FILM FLOW; ENTRAINMENT
AB In this paper classical hybrid combustion theory is generalized to solid fuels that form a liquid layer on their burning surface. For several classes of liquefying fuels, the layer is hydrodynamically unstable in a gas flow environment leading to substantial droplet entrainment into the gas stream. The susceptibility of a given fuel to this shear driven instability increases with decreasing viscosity and surface tension of the melt layer. The entrainment mass transfer, which acts in addition to the conventional gasification mechanism, is not affected by the blocking phenomenon induced by blowing from the surface. For practical oxidizer flux levels encountered in hybrid rocket applications, droplet entrainment can dominate direct gasification. Such liquefying fuels can exhibit greatly increased surface regression rates compared to classical materials such as Hydroxyl Terminated Polybutadiene. One application of the theory is to solid cryogenic hybrids, which utilize frozen materials for the solid propellant. The theory successfully predicts why high regression rates are observed in tests of cryogenic solid pentane, solid methane, and solid oxygen. In addition, the theory explains the dependence of the burning rates of other tested cryogenic materials on the physical properties of the liquid layer. The theory also leads to the conclusion that certain noncryogenic materials such as paraffin and Polyethylene waxes will also exhibit high regression rates. This important result is confirmed by lab scale tests performed at Stanford University on a high melting point paraffin wax.

TI Modeling of flow and radiation in the Atlas plume
SO JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER

DT Article
ID ROCKET
AB Modeling results and data are presented for a chemically reacting flow from a thrusting Atlas II rocket at low altitudes. High spatial resolution imagery and spectra have been obtained for a kerosene/liquid oxygen multinozzle plume at altitudes in the continuum flow regime. A numerical solution for a three-dimensional plume flow from the Atlas rocket engine is obtained using two different Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics codes. The influence of the flow near the rocket body on the plume structure is considered at an altitude of 40 kin. The plume flowfields at 15- and 40-km altitudes are used for radiation calculations in the infrared spectral region. Calculated spectral radiant intensities and pixelated images are compared with the data extracted from the recent in-flight measurements. Comparison of the modeling with the data shows that numerical modeling is able to predict the plume structure existing at both altitudes. We find that it is necessary to include solid carbon particles as a radiating species to improve the agreement between simulated and measured radiation signatures.

   light sheet
AB Phenomena such as flame propagation, flame/spray interaction and flame stabilization during the transient ignition process in a cryogenic model rocket combustor are investigated on sub-millisecond time scale. Diagnostic techniques developed to characterize the stationary spray flame are applied to investigate the transient evolution of the LOX-spray and the flame front during the ignition process. Ignition is initiated by focusing a pulsed laser into the combustion chamber. Thus, ignition time as well as the position of ignition is well defined. This and the exact control of the delay between ignition and detection time allowed the observation of the evolution of the flame front. The distribution of the liquid oxygen phase and the velocity of LOX droplets and ligaments are determined by light sheet techniques using a double-pulsed laser system. Simultaneously the position of the flame front is measured by recording the spontaneous emission of the OH-radical. By varying the delay time t between ignition and detection in a series of test runs, the transient ignition phenomena has been investigated in the interval from 0 to 5 ms after ignition.

AB The first stage of the H-2 rocket used a 110-ton thrust liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, pump-fed engine, the LE-7. This engine required high-pressure and high-power liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen turbopumps to achieve the two-stage combustion cycle in which the combustion pressure is around 13 MPa. Furthermore, it was very important to operate both turbopumps at higher rotational speeds to obtain a smaller, lighter-weight engine because the LE-7 had not low-speed, low-pressure pumps ahead of both the main pumps. The present paper shows the design, test results, and modifications that had been performed until a flight-type liquid oxygen turbopump for the LE-7 engine was completed. The liquid oxygen turbopump had been developed by the use of three models, that is, research, prototype, and flight models.

AB The performance of a ducted rocket motor depends greatly on the composition of the exhaust products from its solid fuel gas generator. A series of experiments has been conducted to characterize the exhaust of GAP/carbon gas generator fuels as a function of pressure and grain formulation. Fuel samples were ignited in a closed vessel and gases collected for further analysis using gas chromatography. The major gaseous components identified in the exhaust stream were nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon monoxide while the condensed phase was found to be a carbon-rich soot. The relative amounts of each major component depended greatly on the chamber pressure and the precise formulation used, thus providing a simple means of optimizing the exhaust composition to maximize the performance of the ducted rocket propulsion systems.

ID STEADY-STATE FLAMES; LAMINAR
AB The paper describes a quasi-one-dimensional model of combustion of sandwich heterogeneous solid rocket propellant designed to predict the burnup rate of individual components (oxidizer and binder) and the average mass rate of combustion of the entire propellant. This model includes the heat- and mass-transfer and kinetic-gasdynamic processes in the gas phase above the surface of burning solid propellant, as well as the heat-transfer processes in solid material. Included in the calculations are the thermochemical properties of ammonium perchlorate (AP, oxidizer) and of polybutadiene rubber (PBR, fuel). The thermochemical processes are included in the kinetic scheme of two overall chemical reactions involving five effective chemical components. Systematic calculations are performed of the process of solid fuel combustion with different mass ratios of oxidizer to fuel. It is demonstrated that the employed kinetic model of thermochemical processes provides an adequate description of the available experimental data on the rate of combustion of AP- and PBR-based solid propellants.

AB The mixing and combustion processes in a liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen rocket combustor were studied, The research focused on observations of atomization phenomena during steady-state combustion and ignition transients of a rocket engine. Cold-flow atomization as encountered before ignition has been studied using liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and simulation fluids liquid nitrogen/helium. The theoretical assessments show that for binary- and multicomponent systems a transcritical region exists where surface tension is present even at pressures above the critical pressure of one component as long as the critical mixing temperature is not exceeded. Also, hot-fire tests utilizing liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen demonstrate the strong influence of the dame on the atomization process. The dame propagation during ignition could be identified by the change of the atomization phenomenology before and during the ignition process.

TI Accelerometer spiking under cryogenic conditions

AB Spurious transient outputs of a piezoelectric accelerometer have been observed when the accelerometer is attached to a surface undergoing rapid cool-down to a cryogenic temperature. Such conditions occur in cryogenic propellant rockets on assemblies such as feedlines and turbopumps. Under exposure to liquid oxygen, surface temperatures can drop to near -300 degreesF in a matter of minutes. The occurrence of spurious output depends on the internal construction of the accelerometer and on the effectiveness of thermal isolation provided by the mounting for a susceptible accelerometer. Specifically, an Endevco Model 2271AM20 charge-mode, compression-type accelerometer (CTA) has been observed to produce intermittent spurious output spikes during flight of a launch vehicle, during ground test firing of a rocket engine and in laboratory experiments. It is suggested that this spiking, also known as the pyroelectric effect, can be attributed to charge buildup due to thermal effects in the piezo-electric crystal stack. In the case studies, sporadic jumping of this charge across a gap at the outer edge of the plating on the crystal stack face is believed to cause momentary saturation of the charge amplifier. A replacement Endevco Model 7722 sheer-type accelerometer (STA) using a different type of crystal arrangement as well as a different crystal material proved to eliminate these spurious charge jumps in a series of laboratory tests. This paper presents the results of experiments conducted to evaluate both the CTA and the STA. The effectiveness of different mounting configurations, used to provide thermal isolation sufficient to eliminate the spikes from the CTA, was evaluated. It is also suggested that observations of a particular type of nonzero mean signal in the time domain and broad, elevated, low-frequency content in the frequency spectrum can be useful in detecting the presence of pyroelectric-induced transients, even if the spikes are visually buried within high-amplitude vibration data.

AB A nonlinear acoustic instability of subcritical liquid-oxygen droplet flames burning in gaseous hydrogen environment are investigated numerically. Emphases are focused on the effects of finite-rate kinetics by employing a detailed hydrogen-oxygen chemistry and of the phase change of liquid oxygen. Results show that if nonlinear harmonic pressure oscillations are imposed, larger flame responses occur during the period that the pressure passes its temporal minimum, at which point flames are closer to extinction condition. Consequently, the flame response function, normalized during one cycle of pressure oscillation, increases nonlinearly with the amplitude of pressure perturbation. This nonlinear response behavior can be explained as a possible mechanism to produce the threshold phenomena for acoustic instability, often observed during rocket-engine tests.

TI Chance encounter with a stratospheric kerosene rocket plume from Russia

AB A high-altitude aircraft flight on April 18, 1997, detected an enormous aerosol cloud at 20 km altitude near California (37 degreesN). Not visually observed, the cloud had high concentrations of soot and sulfate aerosol, and was over 180 km in horizontal extent. The cloud was probably a large hydrocarbon-fueled rocket vehicle, most likely burning liquid oxygen and kerosene. One of two Russian Soyuz rockets could have produced the cloud: a launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on April 6; or one from Plesetsk, Russia on April 9. Parcel trajectories and long-lived trace gas concentrations suggest the Baikonur launch as the cloud source. Cloud trajectories do not trace the Soyuz plume from Asia to North America, illustrating the uncertainties of point-to-point trajectories. This cloud encounter is the only stratospheric measurement of a hydrocarbon-fueled rocket.
