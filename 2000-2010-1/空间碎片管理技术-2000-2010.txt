AB Introduction: Each malignant neoplasm can lead towards the initiation of the acute phase reaction. A special form of the acute phase reaction is the coordinated synthesis of several proteins. Quantitative acute phase protein (APP) changes observed during the neoplastic process remain unclear. They can result from the development of immunosuppression connected with the production of immunosuppressive cytokines by the tumor. The research on the role of cytokines and acute phase proteins as prognostic factors, following surgical management of malignant tumors is scarce, and the results are ambiguous.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the quantitive changes of the APP serum level in patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent a radical resection. We analysed the correlations between the quantitive changes of APP and: age, gender, the histological type of cancer, T stage, N stage and grading.
   Material and methods: We analysed a group of 192 patients surgically treated for NSCLC from 2008 to 2009. The study group consisted of 144 male and 48 female patients, aged between 38 and 79 years (average: 62.9 yrs). The most frequent histological types of cancer were: the squamous cell lung cancer (88 patients) and the adenocarcinoma (71 patients). The majority of them were in stage I B (52 patients) and III A (39 patients). We analysed serum levels of: C-reactive protein (CRP), alfa 1 acid glicoprotein (AGP), alfa 1 antitrypsin (AT), and haptoglobin (Hp) using the method of rocket immunoelectroforesis by Laurell. Statistical analysis was based on the Statistica 8.0 software.
   Results: We didn't find any significant differences between APP levels and age, but all APP levels were significantly higher in male patients. The CRP and AT levels correlated with grading and were higher in G2 and G3 tumors. The serum levels of CRP and Hp were significantly higher in patients with squamous cell lung cancer compared to other histological types. The levels all of four APP were significantly higher in the group of patients with T3 or T4 category, while the patients with N1 or N2 status had significantly higher concentrations of CRP and Hp. We observed a positive correlation between serum levels all of APP and TNM stage.
   Conclusions: The serum concentration of selected APP may correlate with more aggressive clinical behaviour of lung cancer. The patients with N1 or N2 stage of the squamous cell lung cancer have significantly higher serum level of CRP and Hp. The preoperative concentration all of APP correlates with TNM stage. These proteins could serve as prognostic factors in the risk assessment of the cancer recurrence after the surgical management.

AB In light of the significant changes being observed in the US space industry, in terms of the increase share of commercial launches, the development of inland spaceports, and the emergence of new vehicle designs and propulsion systems, there is need to reassess launch safety. In this paper, several issues related to space launch safety are reviewed, one in particular being the use, as the main the safety metric, of the mean collective risk to the general public, also known as the expectation of casualties. A new, decision level, information-fusion-based metric is proposed, and through a detailed case study, its merit in terms of the quality and quantity of information it generates is illustrated. The need for a new metric is here advocated as a critical first step toward the necessary transition from a risk avoidance philosophy to space launch safety to a risk management philosophy.

ID SHUTTLE ENTRY GUIDANCE
AB Using the recently developed model predictive static programming (MPSP) technique, a nonlinear suboptimal reentry guidance scheme is presented in this paper for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV). Unlike traditional RLV guidance, the problem considered over here is restricted only to pitch plane maneuver of the vehicle, which allows simpler mission planning and vehicle load management. The computationally efficient MPSP technique brings in the philosophy of trajectory optimization into the framework of guidance design, which in turn results in very effective guidance schemes in general. In the problem addressed in this paper, it successfully guides the RLV through the critical reentry phase both by constraining it to the allowable narrow flight corridor as well as by meeting the terminal constraints at the end of the reentry segment. The guidance design is validated by considering possible aerodynamic uncertainties as well as dispersions in the initial conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
DE Rocket engine; Man-rated; History; Astronautics
AB The Ludion was a French concept for a military one-man rocket-powered "hopper" aimed at giving troopers the ability to cross rivers or trenches. Sud Aviation was awarded in 1965 the development contract together with Bertin (for the jet pumps) and SEPR was to develop the rocket propulsion system. The propulsion system selected for the "Ludion" was based on the British extensive experience in handling and using isopropyl nitrate as a way of obtaining large amounts of gas able to drive jet engines at start. The idea was to use such a fluid as monopropellant for the propulsion system's gas generator. SEPR integrated this system with pipes and Bertin ejector nozzles and developed a thermally insulated generator able to fulfil all requirements. The main challenges laid in the successful integration of all components and the management of a multi-partners programme and in the design of a highly efficient thermal insulation protecting both generator and pilot from the intense heat generated by the thermal decomposition of isopropyl nitrate (used as a propellant). The first ground test of a Ludion with its rocket propulsion system took place on January 24, 1968, on the test airfield of Villaroche. After 59 tethered and five free flights, the programme was abandoned. It was deemed to be too impractical due to its size, the noise generated and changes in tactical considerations in favour of helicopters and amphibious transports. The first prototype is now displayed at the Paris Le Bourget Air & Space Museum. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A great challenge for the success of intercropping systems is the ability in determining which species should be used and, especially, the management of the cultivars or varieties to be associated. The objective of the present research was to evaluate the effect of the association of two cultivars of carrot (Daucus carota L.) with two cultivars of rocket (Eruca sativa M.) in two crops in strip-intercropping system and sole crops on the productive performance of these vegetables. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks in a 2x2+2 factorial with five replications. Treatments were the association of two carrot cultivars (Brasilia and Esplanada) with two rocket cultivars (Cultivada and Folha Larga) plus two additional treatments (two carrot cultivars or two rocket cultivars as sole crops in each block). The major results were: the rocket cultivars Cultivada and Folha Larga showed similar (p>0.05) productive performances in sole crop and intercropping system. The best performance (p <= 0.05) of the rocket was observed in the second cultivation. The carrot cultivar Brasilia showed the best productive performance (p <= 0.05) in both sole crop and intercropping system. The intercropped systems of carrot Brasilia + rocket Cultivada and carrot Brasilia + rocket Folha Larga were the best association based on agri-economic efficiency.

AB Few mutants conferring herbicide tolerance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L) have been developed Imazamox (2-[(RS)-4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl]-5-methoxymethylnicotinic acid) is a broad spectrum imidazolinone herbicide that could give growers a new tool to control many troublesome annual broadleaf and grass weeds Our objective was to identify imazamox tolerance in chemical mutation derived cotton lines Four imazamox tolerant mutant cotton (G hirsutum) genetic stocks, SCM(3)-4-3 (Reg No GS-3, PI 657941), SCM(3)-7-3 (Reg No GS-4, PI 657942), RM(3)-8-1 (Reg No GS-5, PI 657943), and EM(4)-3-1 (Reg No GS-6, PI 657944) were developed and jointly released by Texas Tech University, Department of Plant and Soil Science, and USDA-ARS Crop Genetics and Production Research Unit, Stoneville, MS, in July, 2009 These genetic stocks were obtained through ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of seeds of three High Plains cotton cultivars (SC 9023, Rocket, and Explorer) and selection with imazamox herbicide Application of five rates of imazamox (0, 88, 175, 350, and 700 g a (-1) ha(-1)) has shown that these mutants have elevated levels of tolerance to imazamox These genetic stocks are available for use by the cotton industry and public researchers to create hybrids, parental lines, or germplasm lines with resistance to the imazamox herbicide The identification of these mutants is expected to increase weed management options available to conventional growers who have become heavily dependent on glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] based crop production systems

AB Inert or dry mass in aerospace systems has historically grown during aerospace vehicle development because of a number of factors: changing requirements, uncertainty in the performance of the initial technology selection, addition of redundancy, errors in the original design, as well as uncertain masses and loads. In the case of exploration architectures for lunar missions, compounding effects of a multi-staged mission design makes mass-efficient vehicles a necessity for achieving the total delta-V performance required to reach the lunar surface and return to Earth. Current standards and guidelines for mass growth risk mitigation are compared, including the industry and NASA standard methods for risk management and mitigation through the application of mass margin. Historical mass growth trends are analyzed, and average levels of growth are compared to the standard margin allocation levels. Analysis of the available historical data shows that the mean inert mass growth is 28%, and 30% of historical programs experience inert mass growth in excess of the allowable growth and margin recommended level of 32.5%. As an illustrative example of the mass growth of lunar exploration architectures the mass growth sensitivity of the Apollo architecture is calculated. Results show that a kilogram of mass growth on the lunar ascent stage is compounded over 800 times in gross mass. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Robust terminal area energy management guidance using flatness approach
SO IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS
AB This study deals with the design of a guidance scheme based on flatness theory and dedicated to the terminal area energy management phase of a reusable launch vehicle. The proposed guidance strategy is based on a non-linear dynamic inversion technique to handle the large flight envelope that characterises the reentry mission. This inversion takes advantage of a particular choice of linearising terms called flat outputs, that are used to perform an input-to-state linearisation. First, it is shown that the coupled in-plane and out-of-plane vehicle dynamics admits a set of flat outputs. The flatness property of this model is then used to compute the nominal control input profiles corresponding to a single reference trajectory computed off-line. Based on the linearised model obtained by dynamic inversion, a linear tracking controller is then designed so as to circumvent off-nominal flight conditions. Finally, robustness and performances of the proposed guidance scheme are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs within an industrial simulation environment.

TI Electrostatic Plasma Brake for Deorbiting a Satellite
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRIC SAIL
AB Space debris in the form of abandoned satellites is a growing concern, especially at the heavily populated 600-1000 km altitude orbits. To prevent new space junk from forming, new satellites should be equipped with a deorbiting mechanism. The problem is especially tricky for the emerging class of very small satellites for which using a braking rocket as a deorbit mechanism may have a prohibitively high relative cost impact. We describe a novel type of deorbiting mechanism that is suitable for small satellites with a mass of up to a few hundred kilograms. The method is a plasma brake device based on coulomb drag interaction between the ionospheric plasma and a negatively charged thin tether. The method resembles the well-known electrodynamic tether deorbit mechanism, but the underlying physical mechanism is different and the new method has an order of magnitude smaller mass and power consumption. The new method uses the same physical principle (coulomb drag) as the recently invented electric solar wind sail propulsion method. Furthermore, the tether required by the plasma brake is so thin that, if accidentally cut, the loose fragments of it pose no threat to other spacecraft and will rapidly descend into the atmosphere. The electrostatic plasma brake could enable an extended use of small satellites by resolving their associated space debris problem.

AB The study of a bubbly laminar two-phase flow in an open capillary channel under microgravity conditions was conducted aboard the sounding rocket, Texus-45. The channel geometry, the liquid (FC-72) and the experimental conditions were chosen based on an analysis for application toward liquid management in space. The channel consists of two parallel plates that were b = 25 mm wide and separated by a distance of a = 10 mm. The flow along the length l = 80 mm is bounded by a free surface on one side and a plate on the opposite side. Bubbles are injected at the inlet of the capillary channel via six capillary tubes. The features of the gas injection were chosen with regard to the required bubble size, the injection frequency, and the gas and liquid flow rates. Different liquid and gas flow rates were tested leading to a volumetric quality ranging between 0.07 and 0.11. The experimental results show the interaction among bubbles and with the liquid free surface.

AB Disturbances may acid or remove resources from communities and can facilitate the spread of some invaders. Differential successes of exotic plants to spread into different communities suggest that some habitats are more invasible than others. Hesperis matronalis (dame's rocket) is widespread across the continent and has potential to become a major problem in natural communities owing to its ability to exploit excess resources and its negative effect on native species. We grew H. matronalis seedlings in a Colorado foothill community at various levels of nitrogen and water with and without neighbors. We expected H. matronalis to maximize its growth Under high resource conditions especially without. neighbors because ruderal species are able to take advantage of excess resources. Our results reveal that presence or absence of neighbors was the main decisive factor for H. matronalis (aboveground biomass and relative growth rate) success, though seedlings particularly suffered under low resource conditions. Early determination Of the potential invasiveness of a widespread exotic species such as H. matronalis in natural communities may promote effective management.

DT Article
AB In a little over four decades, the Indian Space Program has carved a niche for itself with the unique application driven program oriented towards National development. The end-to-end capability approach of the space projects in the country call for innovative practices and procedures in assuring the quality and reliability of space systems. The System Reliability (SR) efforts initiated at the start of the projects continue during the entire life cycle of the project encompassing design, development, realisation, assembly, testing and integration and during launch. Even after the launch, SR groups participate in the on-orbit evaluation of transponders in communication satellites and camera systems in remote sensing satellites. SR groups play a major role in identification, evaluation and inculcating quality practices in work centres involved in the fabrication of mechanical, electronics and propulsion systems required for Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO's) launch vehicle and spacecraft projects. Also the reliability analysis activities like prediction, assessment and demonstration as well as de-rating analysis, Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and worst-case analysis are carried out by SR groups during various stages of project realisation. These activities provide the basis for project management to take appropriate techno-managerial decisions to ensure that the required reliability goals are met. Extensive test facilities catering to the needs of the space program has been set up. A system for consolidating the experience and expertise gained for issue of standards called product assurance specifications to be used in all ISRO centres has also been established.

AB This paper presents in brief the formulation for lateral and longitudinal dynamics associated with the separation and pull out of an ongoing functional stage from the spent stage of a multistage launch vehicle using separation motors as jettisoning system. Taguchi method is employed to understand the influencing parameters in the separation process. It is possible to minimize the number of Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS) by Taguchi's orthogonal array. Statistical analysis has been carried out to identify the probability distribution function (PDF) for reliability and safety assessment of the stage separation system. The tolerances on the pull out time, relative velocity, lateral gap and longitudinal clearances between the separating bodies are taken into account while examining the non-occurrence of collision between the separating bodies. Lateral gap/dynamic clearance between stages are found to be very vital from collision aspects. This study clearly demonstrates the applicability of Taguchi method to capture the essential Monte-Carlo simulation results in the stage separation process. The method of approach followed in this study will be useful to understand the dynamic behavior of the separating bodies during the stage separation process of multistage launch vehicles.

ID WAR; INJURIES; CARE
AB The Rambam Medical Center, the major academic health center in northern Israel, serving a population of two million and providing specialized tertiary care, was exposed to an unprecedented experience during the Second Lebanon War in the summer of 2006. For more than one month, it was subjected to continuous rocket attacks, but it continued to provide emergency and routine medical services to the civilian population and also served the military personnel who were evacuated from the battlefront. To accomplish the goals of serving the population while itself being under fire, the Rambam Medical Center had to undertake major organizational decisions, which included maximizing safety within the hospital by shifting patients and departments, ensuring that the hospital was properly fortified, managing the health professional teams' work schedules, and providing needed services for the families of employees. The Rambam Medical Center's Level 1 trauma center expertise included multidisciplinary teams and extensive collaborations; modern imaging modalities usually reserved for peacetime medical practice were frequently used. The function of the hospital teams during the war was efficient and smooth, based on the long-term actions taken to prepare for disasters and wartime conditions. Routine hospital services continued, although at 60% of normal occupancy. Financial losses incurred were primarily due to the decrease in revenue-generating activity. The two most important components of managing the hospital under these conditions are (1) the ability to arrive at prompt and meaningful decisions with respect to the organizational and medical hospital operations and (2) the leadership and management of the professional staff and teams.

AB The 'particles-in-a-box' (PIB) model introduced by Talent [Talent, D.L. Analytic model for orbital debris environmental management. J. Spacecraft Rocket, 29 (4), 508-513, 1992.] removed the need for computer-intensive Monte Carlo simulation to predict the gross characteristics of an evolving debris environment. The PlB model was described using a differential equation that allows the stability of the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment to be tested by a straightforward analysis of the equation's coefficients. As part of an ongoing research effort to investigate more efficient approaches to evolutionary modelling and to develop a suite of educational tools, a new PlB model has been developed. The model, entitled Fast Debris Evolution (FADE), employs a first-order differential equation to describe the rate at which new objects >= 10 cm are added and removed from the environment. Whilst Talent [Talent, D.L. Analytic model for orbital debris environmental management. J. Spacecraft Rocket, 29 (4), 508-513, 1992.] based the collision theory for the PlB approach on collisions between gas particles and adopted specific values for the parameters of the model from a number of references, the form and coefficients of the FADE model equations can be inferred from the outputs of future projections produced by high-fidelity models, such as the DAMAGE model.
   The FADE model has been implemented as a client-side, web-based service using JavaScript embedded within a HTML document. Due to the simple nature of the algorithm, FADE can deliver the results of future projections immediately in a graphical format, with complete user-control over key simulation parameters. Historical and future projections for the >= 10 cm. LEO debris environment under a variety of different scenarios are possible, including business as usual, no future launches, post-mission disposal and remediation. A selection of results is presented with comparisons with predictions made using the DAMAGE environment model. The results demonstrate that the FADE model is able to capture comparable time-series of collisions and number of objects as predicted by DAMAGE in several scenarios. Further, and perhaps more importantly, its speed and flexibility allows the user to explore and understand the evolution of the space debris environment. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center's E-3 test facility.

DE IBEX; Spacecraft; Launch
AB IBEX provides the observations needed for detailed modeling and in-depth understanding of the interstellar interaction (McComas et al. in Physics of the Outer Heliosphere, Third Annual IGPP Conference, pp. 162-181, 2004; Space Sci. Rev., 2009a, this issue). From mission design to launch and acquisition, this goal drove all flight system development. This paper describes the management, design, testing and integration of IBEX's flight system, which successfully launched from Kwajalein Atoll on October 19, 2008. The payload is supported by a simple, Sun-pointing, spin-stabilized spacecraft with no deployables. The spacecraft bus consists of the following subsystems: attitude control, command and data handling, electrical power, hydrazine propulsion, RF, thermal, and structures. A novel 3-step orbit approach was employed to put IBEX in its highly elliptical, 8-day final orbit using a Solid Rocket Motor, which provided large delta-V after IBEX separated from the Pegasus launch vehicle; an adapter cone, which interfaced between the SRM and Pegasus; Motorized Lightbands, which performed separation from the Pegasus, ejection of the adapter cone, and separation of the spent SRM from the spacecraft; a ShockRing isolation system to lower expected launch loads; and the onboard Hydrazine Propulsion System. After orbit raising, IBEX transitioned from commissioning to nominal operations and science acquisition. At every phase of development, the Systems Engineering and Mission Assurance teams supervised the design, testing and integration of all IBEX flight elements.

AB This paper describes a novel optimisation-based framework for analysing the robustness of advanced flight control laws for reusable launch vehicles. The proposed analysis methods are applied and tested on an industrial-standard simulation model of a reusable launch vehicle equipped with a full authority nonlinear dynamic inversion-based flight control law. The reliability, computational complexity and efficiency of the framework are evaluated against standard industrial approaches based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results of the study show that the proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and efficiency of the flight clearance process for future reusable launch vehicles.

DE Space debris; orbital debris; reentry hazards; debris removal; collision
   avoidance; space traffic control
AB Man's activities in space are creating a shell of space debris around planet Earth which provides a growing risk of collision with operating satellites and manned systems. Including both the larger tracked objects and the small, untracked debris, more than 98% of the estimated 600,000 objects larger than 1 cm currently in orbit are "space junk"-dead satellites, expended rocket stages, debris from normal operations, fragments from explosions and collisions, and other material. Recognizing the problem, space faring nations have joined together to develop three basic principles for minimizing the growth of the debris population: prevent on-orbit breakups, remove spacecraft and orbital stages that have reached the end of their mission operations from the useful densely populated orbit regions, and limit the objects released during normal operations. This paper provides an overview of what is being done to support these three principles and describes proposals that an active space traffic control service to warn satellite operators of pending collisions with large objects combined with a program to actively remove large objects may reduce the rate of future collisions. The paper notes that cost and cost effectiveness are important considerations that will affect the evolution of such systems.

TI Additional historical solid rocket motor burns
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of orbital solid rocket motors (SRM) is responsible for the release of a high number of slag and Al(2)O(3) dust particles which contribute to the space debris environment. This contribution has been modeled for the ESA space debris model MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference). The current model version, MASTER-2005, is based on the simulation of 1076 orbital SRM firings which mainly contributed to the long-term debris environment. SRM firings on very low earth orbits which produce only short living particles are not considered. A comparison of the modeled flux with impact data from returned surfaces shows that the shape and quantity of the modeled SRM dust distribution matches that of recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array measurements very well. However, the absolute flux level for dust is under-predicted for some of the analyzed Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) surfaces. This indicates that some past SRM firings are not included in the current event database. Thus it is necessary to investigate, if additional historical SRM burns, like the retro-bum of low orbiting re-entry capsules, may be responsible for these dust impacts. The most suitable candidates for these firings are the large number of SRM retro-bums of return capsules. This paper focuses on the SRM retro-bums of Russian photoreconnaissance satellites, which were used in high numbers during the time of the LDEF mission. It is discussed which types of satellites and motors may have been responsible for this historical contribution. Altogether, 870 additional SRM retro-bums have been identified. An important task is the identification of such missions to complete the current event data base. Different types of motors have been used to de-orbit both large satellites and small film return capsules. The results of simulation runs are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last twenty years, the level of international research collaboration on military energetic materials has increased significantly and has been reported in the literature. It is time to look at what has been done and to critically examine that benefits that it has produced. The range of programmes has covered the whole range of energetic materials and in addition to the study of ne,x materials and new forms of materials, it has covered modelling as well as standards and protocols. Programmes have ranged from pressed explosives to rocket propellants and from IM technology to environmental and life management. It can be argued that these programmes have provided the participating nations with materials as well as the understanding to better manage their behaviour and use. Without this range of activity significantly less Would have been achieved. This will be discussed in the light of a selection of published papers and reports.

ID DEMAND; SALES; PRICE; EXECUTION; CHOICE; MODELS
AB Retailing is a huge industry. In the United States, retail business represents about 40% of the economy and is the largest employer. Retail supply chain management is still more art than science, but this is changing rapidly as retailers begin to apply analytic models to the huge volume of data they are collecting on consumer purchases and preferences. This industry-wide movement resembles the transformation of Wall Street that occurred in the 1970s when physicists and other "rocket scientists" applied their analytic skills to investment decisions.
   The Consortium for Operational Excellence in Retailing (COER) (codirected by Ananth Raman, Harvard Business School, and myself) is a group of academics working with about 50 leading retailers to assess their progress towards rocket science retailing and to accelerate that progress through selected research projects.
   After some brief comments on the current state of industry practice in retail supply chain management, this paper will describe examples of COER research in four areas: assortment planning, pricing, inventory optimization, and store execution.

TI A study of the material density distribution of space debris
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Orbital debris; Debris; Composition; Materials; Breakup; Modeling
AB Material density is ail important, yet often overlooked, property of orbital debris particles. Many models simply use a typical density to represent all breakup fragments. While adequate for modeling average characteristics in some applications, a single value material density may not be sufficient for reliable impact damage assessments. In an attempt to improve the next-generation NASA Orbital Debris Engineering Model, a study oil the material density distribution of the breakup fragments has been conducted and summarized in this paper.
   The material density distribution of the on-orbit breakup debris population may be estimated by combining three sources of data: available pre-launch information on satellite materials, ground-based satellite breakup experiments, and chemical compositions of residuals collected from returned surfaces. Analysis of these data provides a basis to compile a simple mass density distribution. For example, about 75% of on-orbit breakup debris fragments come from upper stages, which are simpler and more standardized than payloads in construction and composition. Available material information from manufacturers can be used to develop a reasonable distribution function for this component. For spacecraft breakup debris, it has been found that the range of material densities may be simplified into three representative Values: high (e.g. steel), medium (e.g. aluminum), and low (,e.g. plastic). The current study develops preliminary distributions for breakup debris: rocket body debris is 90% medium-density and 10% high-density (by number); payload debris is 70% low-density, 27% medium, and 3% high-density. Although the three data sources mentioned above are not comprehensive, and some interpretation and extrapolation arc needed. the resulting density distributions still represent a step forward in providing more reliable damage assessments for future debris models. Future work will refine the data and provide distributions as functions of particle size and orbital altitude. (C) 2008 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI WILLIAM CONGREVE'S RATIONAL ROCKETS
SO NOTES AND RECORDS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Review
DE Sir William Congreve; Congreve rockets; fireworks; science in the
   British military, ca. 1770-1810
AB This article examines the early development of military rockets devised by the English inventor and Royal Society Fellow William Congreve in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Congreve's efforts to imitate Indian war rockets used against the British in Mysore are set within a number of local and global contexts that saw increasing attempts by Europeans to imitate eastern pyrotechnics while applying economic and scientific principles to reform pyrotechnic production. Congreve viewed his rockets as 'rational', operated via an experimental system that dispensed with the need for any skilled labour, save Congreve's own inventive capacities. But when rockets were put to the test, naval officers, artisans and other inventors all disputed this claim, and this article shows how their various skills proved indispensable in making the rocket work. Congreve responded by erasing both distant Indian and local British contributions to the rocket system. The career of Congreve rockets thus demonstrates how local processes of disciplinary reform around 1800, entailing rational management based on scientific and economic principles, were intimately connected with orientalizing tendencies in Britain, which sought to portray distant cultures of the East as backward and static, justifying imperial domination.

ID DEBRIS REMOVAL SYSTEM; SATELLITE; SURVIVABILITY; MODEL
AB By using electrodynamic drag to greatly increase the orbital decay rate, an electrodynamic space tether can remove spent or dysfunctional spacecraft from low Earth orbit (LEO) rapidly and safely, Moreover, the low mass requirements of such tether devices make them highly advantageous compared to conventional rocket-based de-orbit systems. However, a tether system is much more vulnerable to space debris impacts than a typical spacecraft and its design must be proved to be safe up to a certain confidence level before being adopted for potential applications. To assess space debris related concerns, in March 2001 a new task (Action Item 19.1) on the "Potential Benefits and Risks of Using Electrodynamic Tethers for End-of-life De-orbit of LEO Spacecraft" was defined by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). Two tests were proposed to compute the fatal impact rite of meteoroids and orbital debris on space tethers in circular orbits, at different altitudes and inclinations, as it function of the tether diameter to assess the survival probability of an electrodynamic tether system during typical de-orbiting missions. IADC members from three agencies, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), participated in the study and different computational approaches were specifically developed within the framework of the IADC task. This paper summarizes the content of the IADC AI 19.1 Final Report. In particular, it introduces the potential benefits and risks of using tethers in space, it describes the assumptions Made in the study plan, it compares and discusses the results obtained by ASI, JAXA and NASA for the two tests proposed, Some general conclusions and recommendations are finally extrapolated from this massive and intensive piece of research.

TI Effect of Removal of Hesperis matronalis (Dame's Rocket) on Species

AB Exotic invasive plant species differ in their effects oil indigenous vegetation its evidenced by research evaluating community response to their removal. We used a removal approach to quantify file response of a mesic woodland to the removal versus retention of an invasive plant, Hesperis matronalis (dame's rocket) from paired treatment plots over 3 y. Cover of H. matronalis did not differ between control and treatment plots prior to removal, declined in the removal plots and remained significantly lower in cover compared to file control plots. Removal did not significantly affect species richness and species diversify (evenness, Shannon and Simpson) at the plot scale, but did result in increased Species richness overall in the removal plots in the last sampling year when compared to control plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis indicated a significant compositional change in the spring plant composition of plots over the 3 y, reflecting an increase in exotic woody species. Exotic Woolly plants, especially Rosa multiflora and Euonymus alatus, increased in cover in response to H matronalis removal. In the 3 y, neither native nor exotic forbs, nor native woody plains responded to the removal of H. matronalis in a statistically significant manner. The increasing cover of woody invasive plants in response to the removal of II. matronalis has important management implications for restoration of degraded communities.

ID ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; PREVALENCE; ONCOLOGY; INTERNET; QUALITY; ISSUES;
   CARE
AB Many cancer patients seek complementary therapies (CTs) for cancer management; however, relatively little is known about patients' CT information seeking behaviour. Therefore, we assessed: 1) cancer patients' use of the types and sources of CT information; 2) their information preferences; and 3) their understanding of the phrase "scientific evidence or proof that a therapy works." We collected data from 404 patients attending the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (TBCC) in Calgary and 303 patients calling the Cancer Information Service (CIS) helpline. In most cases, patients wanted information on the safety of CTs, how CTs work and their potential side effects. Physicians and conventional cancer centres were the most desired sources of CT information, but relatively few patients obtained information via these sources. Although patients were aware of the meaning of scientific evidence, they often used information based on non-scientific evidence, such as patient testimonials. The creation of a supportive care environment in conventional cancer treatment centres, by providing CT information, may help address cancer patients' concerns and alleviate some of the stress that may have been caused by the cancer diagnosis.

AB The use of cover crops in orchards has increased in the last years in Mediterranean regions due to serious soil erosion problems. Brassicas show promising characteristics for erosion control such us rapid growth and production of abundant biomass, and also have a powerful root system, which helps to relieve soil compaction and to increase infiltration. The objective of this work was to select brassica species that are well adapted as cover crops to Mediterranean pedoclimatic conditions and to define the soil management practice and sowing depth for better emergence and establishment of the best-adapted species. To this aim ten wild and cultivated brassicas were evaluated in different soils during two growing season. Sinapis alba subsp. mairei and Eruca vesicaria had the highest coverage levels and were easily adapted to different soils showing they can be successfully used as cover crops in Mediterranean conditions.

AB Viral infection causes host cells to produce type I interferons (IFNs), which are critically involved in viral clearance. Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 is essential for virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RBCC protein interacting with PKC1 (RBCK1) catalyzes the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF3. Overexpression of RBCK1 negatively regulates Sendai virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs, while knockdown of RBCK1 has the opposite effect. Plaque assays consistently demonstrate that RBCK1 negatively regulates the cellular antiviral response. Furthermore, viral infection leads to induction of RBCK1 and subsequent degradation of IRF3. These findings suggest that the cellular antiviral response is controlled by a negative feedback regulatory mechanism involving RBCK1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of IRF3.

AB The paper aims at presenting a Web-based product structure manager that enables designers to hold virtual meetings via Internet and that allows collaborative viewing, modification of product structure and annotation of the 3D model. This Web-based product structure manager provides a shared platform for the designers. Two concerns of designers of large systems are addressed in this application. First, heterogeneous application systems are used by designers and second, designers are geographically dispersed. In this context, STEP standard was found superior for data exchange among diverse CAD systems and the product structure manager has been developed as a "Web-based" application to achieve collaboration among designers. A case study has been carried out with this developed architecture for assembly modeling of a launch vehicle system called launcher hold and release system and its outcome is discussed in detail in this paper.

AB The transcription factor Pax6 is an important developmental regulator. Spatiotemporal control of Pax6 expression during embryogenesis is crucial for regulating distinct aspects of cortical development. Here, we report that Trim11, a member of the TRIM/RBCC protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, interacts with Pax6 and mediates Pax6 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Trim11 overexpression decreases endogenous Pax6 protein levels and represses Pax6 functions, including Pax6-dependent transactivation and neurogenesis. Abrogation of endogenous Trim11 expression in the developing cortex increases the level of insoluble forms of Pax6 and enhances apoptosis. We provide evidence that the B30.2 domain of Trim11 is essential for the clearance of insoluble cell proteins. Furthermore, we show that the expression of Trim11 is directly regulated by Pax6 in developing cortex in vivo. Our findings indicate that an autoregulatory feedback loop between Trim11 and Pax6 maintains a balance between the levels of Pax6 and Trim11 proteins in cortical progenitors, having an essential role for the Pax6-dependent neurogenesis.

AB Human exploration and development of space is being pursued by spacefaring nations to explore, use, and enable the development of space and expand the human experience there. The goals include: increasing human knowledge of nature's processes using the space environment; exploring and settling the solar system; achieving routine space travel; and enriching life on Earth through living and working in space. A crucial aspect of future space missions is the development of infrastructure to optimize safety, productivity, and costs. A major component of mission execution is operations management. NASA's International Space Station is providing extensive experience in both infrastructure and operations. In view of this, a vigorously organized approach is needed to implement successful space-, planet-, and ground-based research and operations that entails wise and efficient use of technical and human resources.
   Many revolutionary technologies being pursued by researchers and technologists may be vital in making space missions safe, reliable, cost-effective, and productive. These include: ionic polymer-metal composite technology; solid-state lasers; time-domain sensors and communication systems; high-temperature superconductivity; nanotechnology; variable specific impulse magneto plasma rocket; fuzzy logic; wavelet technology; and neural networks. An overview of some of these will be presented, along with their application to space missions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews the available knowledge on sedimentology, hydrodynamics and five major ecosystem components (microphytobenthos, vascular plants, terrestrial arthropods, zoobenthos, and avifauna) of Belgian sandy beaches. It covers the area from the foredunes to the lower foreshore, takes an ecosystem approach to beaches of this specific geographic area. Morphodynamically, Belgian beaches are (ultra-)dissipative, macrotidal, and wide. Characteristic grain sizes are 160-380 mu m. The sand becomes coarser, beach slopes steeper and tidal range smaller towards the south-west, where beaches have also been frequently reshaped by human interference such as nourishment. Beach organisms are highly adapted to this unique environment and can reach high numbers. We show that even on a heavily populated coastline subjected to intense recreational and development pressure, beaches provide critical, yet threatened, habitats. Vascular plants growing near the drift line, on the dry beach and in the embryonic dunes are mostly short-lived and thalassochorous; the most common species include sea rocket (Cakile maritima), prickly saltwort (Salsola kali subsp. kali), and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). These zones are habitat to a highly diverse suite of terrestrial arthropods of halobiontic, halophilous and haloxene species; prominent members are sandhoppers (Talitrus saltator) and dipterans (flies). Microphytobenthos, mainly diatoms, is an important primary producer on Belgian beaches but is not well known. The meio- and macrobenthos of Belgian beaches contains specific assemblages such as the Scolelepis squamata-Eurydice pulchra community of the upper intertidal zone. Birds no longer nest on the beaches itself, but Belgian sandy shores continue to function as important resting and foraging areas for birds such as the sanderling Calidris alba. We identify several human pressures on the beach ecosystems arising from recreation, beach management and fisheries.

AB Following the completion of NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study in August 2004 for the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), the Ares Projects Office at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was assigned project management responsibilities for the design and development of the first vehicle in the architecture, the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), which will be used to launch astronauts to low earth orbit and rendezvous with either the International Space Station or the ESMD's earth departure stage for lunar or other future missions beyond low Earth orbit. The primary elements of the Ares I CLV project are the first stage, the upper stage, the upper stage engine, and vehicle integration. Within vehicle integration is an effort in integrated design and analysis which is comprised of a number of technical disciplines needed to support vehicle design and development. One of the important disciplines throughout the life of the project is aerodynamics. This paper will present the status, plans, and initial results of Ares I CLV aerodynamics as the project was preparing for the Ares I CLV Systems Requirements Review. Following a discussion of the specific interactions with other technical panels and a status of the current activities, the plans for aerodynamic support of the Ares I CLV until the initial crewed flights will be presented.

DE space system verification
AB Having a solid verification program that ensures a "system is built right" plays a crucial role in both government and commercial space programs, since even the smallest error in a requirement, design/analysis, test, orinspection at every level of a system development could cause a major system malfunction and would be almost impossible to troubleshoot and repair once in space. According to the space/launch vehicles (SV/LVs) failure related data that have been collected by Aerospace Corporation since the 1960s, almost all of the post-launch failures could have been prevented if their problems had been discovered prior to the shipment of these vehicles to their launch sites. in particular, it was found that the majority of these vehicles could have been successful if deficiencies were corrected during early phase (requirement and design phases) or lower system level of their systems development. in general, any latent problems discovered later on in system development would significantly impact cost and schedule of space programs, even if they were successfully corrected prior to launch. This paper presents a systematic approach to planning and executing verification of space systems based on a distributed-space system verification program. it enforces a standardized set of modular-management processes at every level and phase of space system development activities. This distributed verification program approach tries to enforce a standard set of management processes in order to prevent Total System Program Responsibility (TSPR) philosophy, a "faster, better, cheaper" approach, from being unintentionally adopted at any level of space system development due to schedule and cost pressures. This space systems verification approach is now explained in an U.S. DoD best practice document and also included in The Aerospace Corporation's specification and standard list. It has also been adopted as a compliance document in some major U.S. space programs, such as GPS Block III, and national security space programs. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The ESA space debris population model MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) considers firings of solid rocket motors (SRM) as a debris source with the associated generation of slag and dust particles. The resulting slag and dust population is a major contribution to the sub-millimetre size debris environment in Earth orbit. The current model version, MASTER-2005, is based on the simulation of 1076 orbital SRM firings which contributed to the long-term debris environment. A comparison of the modelled flux with impact data from returned surfaces shows that the shape and quantity of the modelled SRM dust distribution matches that of recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array measurements very well. However, the absolute flux level for dust is under-predicted for some of the analysed Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) surfaces. This points into the direction of some past SRM firings not included in the current event database. The most suitable candidates for these firings are the large number of SRM retro-burns of return capsules. Objects released by those firings have highly eccentric orbits with perigees in the lower regions of the atmosphere. Thus, they produce no long-term effect on the debris environment. However, a large number of those firings during the on-orbit time frame of LDEF might lead to an increase of the dust population for some of the LDEF surfaces. In this paper, the influence of SRM retro-burns on the short- and long-term debris environment is analysed. The existing firing database is updated with gathered information of some 800 Russian retro-firings. Each firing is simulated with the MASTER population generation module. The resulting population is compared against the existing background population of SRM slag and dust particles in terms of spatial density and flux predictions. (C) 2006 COSPAR.

AB A new paradigm for ceramic composite structural components enables functionality in heat exchange, transpiration, detailed shape, and thermal strain management that significantly exceeds the prior art. The paradigm is based on the use of three-dimensional fiber reinforcement that: is tailored to the specific shape, stress, and thermal requirements of a structural application and therefore generally requires innovative textile methods for each real-features include the attainment of thin skins (less than 1 mm) that are nevertheless structurally robust, transpiration holes formed without cutting fibers, double curvature, compliant integral attachment to other structures that avoids thermal stress buildup, and microcomposite ceramic matrices that minimize spalling and allow the formation of smooth surfaces. All these features can be combined into structures of very varied gross shape and function, using a wide range of materials such as all-oxide systems and SiC and carbon fibers in SiC matrices. Illustrations are drawn from rocket nozzles, thermal protection systems, and gas turbine engines. The new den challenges that arise for such material/structure systems are being met by specialized computational modeling that departs significantly in the representation of materials behavior from that used in conventional finite element methods.

AB A soilless culture system (SCS) can improve the quality of raw material at harvest and enhance post-harvest shelf-life in many fresh-cut vegetables. Fresh-cut produce has been targeted to satisfy the increasing demand for convenience products for modern society. Recently, there has been growing interest to introduce garden cress into the fresh-cut supply chain. A standardised growing system is required to obtain suitable fresh-cut raw material in terms of marketable stage, low nitrate content, and long shelf-life. Four experiments were carried out to investigate a floating SCS and post-harvest management to produce marketable garden cress and to preserve its freshness during shelf-life. Various total N levels (6, 8, 12, or 16 mM), NO3--N:NH4(+)-N ratios (25:75, 50:50, 75:25, or 40:60) in the growing nutrient solution, storage temperatures (4 degrees C, 8 degrees C, or 16 degrees C), and five polypropylene (PP) films used during shelf-life, were tested. The research showed that garden cress is suitable for production in a SCS and that this technique leads to greater commercial production than soil culture, reaching > 600 g m(-2) in 14 d, and > 4,700 g m(-2) in 34 d. Total N at 12 mM was too high to obtain leaves with an acceptable nitrate content (< 2,500 mg kg(-1) FW). Polypropylene film and storage temperature significantly influenced the loss of FW during shelf-life; however, this loss was always below 2%. The optimal storage temperature to maintain freshness was 4 degrees C, while the five PP films tested showed inconsistent results.

AB This article explores the impact of the professional culture of rocket engineering in Stalin's Soviet Union on the engineering and organizational practices of the space program during the Khrushchev era. The Stalinist legacy and the dual military/civilian character of rocket engineers' work profoundly affected the identity of this elite part of Soviet technical intelligentsia. Focusing on such notions as control, authority, and responsibility, this article examines the role of engineering culture in shaping the Soviet approach to the automation of piloted spacecraft control. Through patronage and networking, rocket engineers were able to overcome the inefficiency of Soviet industrial management and to advance their agenda of space exploration.

ID DEBRIS; INDIA
AB Indian Space Research Organization successfully carried out more than 40 space missions, during the last four decades, in the area of space sciences, spacecraft technologies, space applications and launch vehicle technologies. Mission planning and mission design are the most important multi-disciplinary elements in realizing these objectives. The present article describes the methodology followed in mission planning and mission design for different types of space missions of ISRO, bringing out the trade-off and inter-disciplinary nature of these activities. Important aspects of mission planning in the lift-off phase, the atmospheric and exoatmospheric phases of a launch vehicle are described. A number of conflicting mission constraints have to be addressed in designing an optimal and robust mission profile for the launch. In addition to reducing aerodynamic and structural loads, considerations related to flight safety and ground station visibility are important parameters. Special launch considerations are to be addressed in designing trajectories for lunar or planetary missions. Launch phase would extend up to injection of the spacecraft in the desired orbit. Thereupon, the spacecraft mission operations are divided into initial phase and operational phase. Initial orbital phase operations include, orbit raising and acquisition operations, and testing of the payloads. The operational phase of spacecraft mission covers, satellite health monitoring and maintenance, station keeping, special operations on the spacecraft, trend analysis and any contingency operations, all leading to gainful utilization of the satellite. A number of mission operations also have now become imperative for mitigating the detrimental effects of ever increasing space debris.

TI The relevance of economic data in the decision-making process for
   orbital launch vehicle programs, a US perspective
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past fifteen years, major U.S. initiatives for the development of new launch vehicles have been remarkably unsuccessful. The list is long: NLI, SLI, and X-33. not to mention several cancelled programs aimed at high speed airplanes (NASP, HSCT) which would share some similar technological problems. The economic aspects of these programs are equally as important to their success as are the technical aspects. In fact, by largely ignoring economic realities in the decisions to undertake these programs and in subsequent management decisions, space agencies (and their commercial partners) have inadvertently contributed to the eventual demise of these efforts. The transportation revolution that was envisaged by the promises of these programs has never occurred. Access to space is still very expensive; reliability of launch vehicles has remained constant over the years; and market demand has been relatively low, volatile and slow to develop. The changing international context of the industry (launching overcapacity, etc.) has also worked against the investment in new vehicles in the U.S. Today, unless there are unforeseen technical breakthroughs, orbital space access is likely to continue as it has been with high costs and market stagnation. Space exploration will require significant launching capabilities. The details of the future needs are not yet well defined. But, the question of the launch costs, the overall demand for vehicles, and the size and type of role that NASA will play in the overall launch market is likely to influence the industry. This paper will emphasize the lessons learned from the economic and management perspective from past launch programs, analyze the issues behind the demand for launches, and project the challenges that NASA will face as only one new customer in a very complex market situation. It will be important for NASA to make launch vehicle decisions based as much on economic considerations as it does on solving new technical challenges. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics issued the first position paper on space debris 25 years ago, recognition of the threats posed by debris in Earth orbit and the need to act now to protect the future space environment have become widespread. This new awareness has been matched with positive actions by spacecraft and launch vehicle designers, manufacturers, and operators. As a result, a common set of space debris mitigation policies and practices has been forming at both the national and international levels.

TI A constant gain Kalman filter approach for the prediction of re-entry of
   risk objects
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The accurate estimation of the predicted re-entry time of decaying space debris objects is very important for proper planning of mitigation strategies and hazard assessment. This paper highlights the implementation strategies adopted for the online re-entry prediction using Kalman filter approach with constant gains with the states being the semi-major axis, eccentricity and ballistic coefficient and using the measurements of the apogee height and perigee height derived from the Two Line Elements provided by agencies like USSPACECOM. Only a very simple model is utilised for the orbit propagation and a basic feature of the present approach is that any unmodellable state and measurement errors can be accounted for by adjusting the Kalman gains which are chosen based on a suitable cost function. In this paper we provide the details of validating this approach by utilising three re-entries of debris objects, namely, US Sat. No. 25947, SROSS-C2 Satellite and COSMOS 1043 rocket body. These three objects re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 4th March 2000, 12th July 2001 and 19th January 2002, respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil in laboratory microcosm experiments was amended with dried and milled crop residues of onion (Allium cepa L. cv. Mission) or garlic (A. sativa L. cv. California Early). The amendments, along with the additional factors of amendment concentration (0, 1 or 3% (w/w)) and soil temperature (23 or 39 degrees C), were evaluated with respect to germination of seeds of the weedy annual plants Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. (barnyard grass), Portulaca oleracea L. (common purslane), Sisymbrium irio L. (London rocket) and Solanum nigrum L. (black nightshade). Deleterious effects of seed exposure to 39 degrees C versus 23 degrees C were demonstrated in ECHCG, POROL, and SSYIR; and to increasing amendment concentration and the [concentration x temperature] interaction in all four plant species tested (P < 0.05). The effect of garlic versus onion amendment was significant only in SOLNI, where garlic residues demonstrated more herbistatic and/or herbicidal activity. The results of these experiments showed that the garlic and onion plant residues were capable of causing significant reductions in seed germination during their decomposition in soil, but only at elevated (39 degrees C versus 23 degrees C) soil temperature. At the agricultural level, activity of these residues could be exploited as a component of integrated weed management using appropriate crop sequencing, and may extend utility of soil heating treatments (e.g. solarization) for weed control to cooler climates or seasons, or for shorter treatment durations.

ID TRAJECTORIES
AB A method for the implementation of integrated three-degree-of-freedom constrained entry guidance for reusable launch vehicle is presented. Given any feasible entry conditions, terminal area energy management interface conditions, and the reference trajectory generated onboard then, the method can generate a longitudinal guidance profile rapidly, featuring linear quadratic regular method and a proportional-integral-derivative tracking law with time-varying gains, which satisfies all the entry corridor constraints and meets the requirements with high precision. Afterwards, by utilizing special features of crossrange parameter, establishing bank-reversal corridor, and determining bank-reversals according to dynamically adjusted method, the algorithm enables the lateral entry guidance system to fly a wide range of missions and provides reliable and good performance in the presence of significant aerodynamic modeling uncertainty. Fast trajectory guidance profiles and simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various missions and aerodynamic uncertainties are presented to demonstrate the capacity and reliability of this method.

DE launch to space; projectile nosetip; railgun; thermal management
AB A major issue in achieving direct launch to space using electromagnetic railguns from the surface of the earth is that we are at the bottom of a gravity well, requiring very high launch velocities to achieve orbit insertion. The atmosphere is most dense at the earth's surface-this, combined with high velocity, leads to very stressing thermal conditions for the launch aerobody. To minimize aerodynamic losses, a typical hypersonic flight body is a blunt slender cone. The thermal loads are greatest on the nosetip of this cone, and for small bodies (< 10 kg) the thermal loads may exceed the capabilities of present passive thermal protection systems, such as dense, ablative carbon phenolics. Even for launch from a high-altitude airborne platform, aerothermal loads can be considerable unless rocket assist is provided. This paper discusses aspects of the launch package and characteristics of the railgun needed to achieve orbit insertion velocities.

AB The U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Tier I male pubertal protocol was designed as a screen to detect endocrine-disrupting chemicals which may alter reproductive development or thyroid function. One purpose of this in vivo screening protocol is to detect thyrotoxicants via a number of different mechanisms of action, such as thyroid hormone synthesis or clearance. Here we evaluate the ability of this EDSP male pubertal protocol to detect the known thyrotoxicant ammonium perchlorate as an endocrine disruptor. Ammonium perchlorate is a primary ingredient in rocket fuel, fertilizers, paints, and lubricants. Over the past 50 years, potassium perchlorate has been used to treat hyperthyroidism in humans. Perchlorate alters thyroid hormone secretion by competitively inhibiting iodide uptake by the thyroid gland. In this study, ammonium perchlorate was administered at 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg to male Wistar rats based on a pilot study of oral dosing. Doses of 125-500 mg/kg perchlorate decreased T4 in a dose-dependent manner. TSH was significantly increased in a dose-responsive manner at the same doses, while T3 was unchanged at any dose. Thyroid histology was significantly altered at all doses, even at the 62.5 mg/kg, with a clear dose-dependent decrease in colloid area and increase in follicular cell height. No effects on preputial separation, a marker of pubertal progression, or reproductive tract development were observed at any dose. These results demonstrate that the male pubertal protocol is useful for detecting thyrotoxicants which target the thyroid axis by this mechanism (altered uptake of iodide). This study also found that perchlorate exposure during this period did not alter any of the reproductive developmental endpoints. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The nation's goals to replace the aging Space Shuttle fleet and pursue exploration of our solar system and beyond will require more robust, less costly launch vehicles and spacecraft. This paper presents a novel sliding mode control approach, sliding mode control driven by sliding mode disturbance observers with gain adaptation, for a reusable launch vehicle flight control system design as a way to improve robustness to many phenomena such as modeling uncertainties and disturbances, while retaining continuity of control without using high control gains. Because of the robustness to external disturbances and modeling uncertainties, the proposed flight control system design also can reduce cost by requiring less time in design cycle and preflight analyses. This design is applied to terminal area energy management and approach/landing. The multiple-loop flight controller design features low-order disturbance observers that rely only on knowledge of the bounds of the disturbance. A gain-adaptation algorithm is included in the disturbance observer design that provides the least gain needed for existence of the sliding mode. Six degree-of-freedom computer simulations of the X-33 technology demonstration suborbital reusable launch vehicle for nominal and severe wind-gust tests demonstrate improved performance over a more conventional, classical control system design.

AB A rapid urinalysis system based on SPE-LC-MSIMS with an in-house post-analysis data management system has been developed for the simultaneous identification and semi-quantitation of opiates (morphine, codeine), methadone, amphetamines (amphetamine, methylamphetamine (MA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), 11-benzodiazepines or their metabolites and ketamine. The brine samples are subjected to automated solid phase extraction prior to analysis by LC-MS (Finnigan Surveyor LC connected. to a Finnigan LCQ Advantage) fitted with an Alltech Rocket Platinum EPS C-18 column. With a single point calibration at the cut-off concentration for each analyte, simultaneous identification and semi-quantitation for the above mentioned drugs can be achieved in a 10 min run per urine sample. A computer macro-program package was developed to automatically retrieve appropriate data from the analytical data files, compare results with preset values (such as cut-off concentrations, MS matching scores) of each drug being analyzed and generate user-defined Excel reports to indicate all positive and negative results in batch-wise manner for ease of checking. The final analytical results are automatically copied into an Access database for report generation purposes. Through the use of automation in sample preparation, simultaneous identification and semi-quantitation by LC-MS/MS and a tailored made post-analysis data management system, this new urinalysis system significantly improves the quality of results, reduces the post-data treatment time, error due to data transfer and is suitable for high-throughput laboratory in batch-wise operation.

AB Recent European outbreaks of Salmonella thompson and S. newport have been associated with salad rocket (Eruca vesicaria ssp. sativa) and head lettuce (Lactuca sativa), respectively. These cases emphasize the need for good agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruit and vegetables that are to be consumed raw, and the potential for large outbreaks related to fresh produce that is distributed widely. In contrast to North America, legislation in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Europe has moved responsibility for fresh produce food safety away from government and into the supply chain. In the U.K. it is the retailers, notably Marks and Spencer with the Field to Fork codes of practice, who are driving the food safety agenda through the development of their own standards. It is retailer technologists who have been the main motivators and educators of suppliers to apply risk management to limiting or preventing microbial contamination of fresh produce.

AB Acute hemolysis due to ABO-incompatibility caused by transfusion of red blood cell concentrates (RBCC) to the wrong recipient is one of the major causes of transfusion-related death. As part of our policy to improve quality and safety in emergency transfusion, we have developed a standardized surveillance system for supplying RBCC in emergency situations. This surveillance system involves the implementation of a standardized set of basic data transmitted from the requesting unit to the blood bank by phone and a scoring system to check for compliance with guidelines and errors in daily routines. Communication deficiencies and delayed pretransfusion sampling were the most common errors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Xylella fastidioso is a xylem-limited bacterium that causes almond leaf scorch (ALS), Pierce's disease of grapevines, and other plant diseases. We surveyed ground vegetation in ALS-infected almond orchards in California's Central Valley for the presence of this bacterium. Plant tissue samples were collected throughout a 2-year period and processed for the presence of X. fastidiosa using restriction enzyme digestion of RST31 and RST33 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products and bacterial culture on selective media. Overall disease incidence was low in the ground vegetation species; only 63 of 1,369 samples tested positive. Of the 38 species of common ground vegetation tested, 11 tested positive for X. fastidiosa, including such common species as shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), filaree (Erodium spp.), cheeseweed (Malva parvifolia), burclover (Medicago polymorpha), annual bluegrass (Poa annua) London rocket (Sisymbrium irio), and chickweed (Stellaria media). There was a seasonal component to bacterial presence, with positive samples found only between November and March. Both ground vegetation and almond trees were most commonly infected with the almond strain of X. fastidiosa (six of seven surveyed sites). ALS-infected almond samples had an X. fastidiosa concentration within previously reported ranges (1.84 x 10(6) to 2.15 x 10(7) CFU/g); however, we were unable to accurately measure X. fastidioso titer in sampled ground vegetation for comparison. These results are discussed with respect to ground vegetation management for ALS control.

ID LAUNCH
AB The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) recognizes the importance of the current space debris scenario, and the impact it has on the effective utilization of space technology for the improvement in the quality of life on the Earth. ISRO is committed to effective management of the threats due to space debris. Towards this commitment ISRO works on different aspects of space debris, including the debris mitigation measures. This paper highlights the activities and achievements in the implementation of the mitigation measures. ISRO successfully designed and developed a propellant venting system for implementation in the existing upper stage of India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which uses Earth-storable liquid propellants. GSLV also employs passivation of the Cryogenic Upper Stage at the end of its useful mission. ISRO's communication satellites in GSO are designed with adequate propellant margins for re-orbiting at the end of their useful life to a higher graveyard orbit. A typical successful operation in connection with INSAT-2C is described. ISRO developed its debris environmental models and software to predict the close approach of any of the debris to the functional satellites. The software are regularly used for the debris risk management of the orbiting spacecraft and launch vehicles. ISRO recognizes the role of international cooperation in the debris mitigation measures and actively contributes to the efforts of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS).

AB The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) recognizes the importance of the current space debris scenario, and the impact it has on the effective utilization of space technology for the improvement in the quality of life on the Earth. ISRO is committed to effective management of the threats due to space debris. Towards this commitment ISRO works on different aspects of space debris, including the debris mitigation measures. This paper highlights the activities and achievements in the implementation of the mitigation measures. ISRO successfully designed and developed a propellant venting system for implementation in the existing upper stage of India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which uses Earth-storable liquid propellants. GSLV also employs passivation of the Cryogenic Upper Stage at the end of its useful mission. ISRO's communication satellites in GSO are designed with adequate propellant margins for re-orbiting at the end of their useful life to a higher graveyard orbit. A typical successful operation in connection with INSAT-2C is described. ISRO developed its debris environmental models and software to predict the close approach of any of the debris to the functional satellites. The software are regularly used for the debris risk management of the orbiting spacecraft and launch vehicles. ISRO recognizes the role of international cooperation in the debris mitigation measures and actively contributes to the efforts of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS).

AB This paper reviews the history of cryogenic fluid management technology development and infusion into both the Saturn and Centaur vehicles. Ground testing and analysis proved inadequate to demonstrate full scale performance. As a consequence flight demonstration with full scale vehicle was required by both the Saturn and Centaur programs to build confidence that problems were addressed. However; the flight vehicles were highly limited on flight instrumentation and the flight demonstration "locked-in" the design without challenging the function of design elements. Projects reviewed include: the Aerobee Sounding Rocket Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) tests which served as a valuable stepping stone to flight demonstration and built confidence in the ability to handle hydrogen in low gravity; the Saturn IVB Fluid Management Qualification flight test; the Atlas Centaur demonstration flights to develop two burn capability; and finally the Titan Centaur two post mission flight tests.

TI Introduction of a nozzle throat diameter dependency into the SRM dust

SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH

DT Article
DE SRM dust size distribution; SRM firings; nozzle throat diameter;
   aluminium projectiles; validation results
AB The ESA space debris population model MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) considers 1032 firings of solid rocket motors (SRM) with the associated generation of SRM slag and dust particles in its current version. The resulting dust population is a major contribution to the sub-millimetre size space debris environment in Earth orbit. For the modelling of each SRM dust release event a detailed knowledge of the particle size distribution is essential. However, the knowledge of the particle sizes after passing the nozzle throat is poor. The current dust implementation in the MASTER model assumes a fixed size distribution which is identically used for both large upper stages and small apogee motors. This assumption can lead to an over-representation of large dust particles in regions, where mainly apogee motors are used (i.e., Geostationary Earth Orbit) and an under-representation in lower altitudes, where large stages predominate. In this paper, a concept for the improvement of SRM dust size modelling is discussed. It will be shown that an introduction of a nozzle throat diameter dependency into the dust size distribution enables a more precise modelling of SRM dust release events. The improved SRM dust size distribution is going to be used by the MASTER-2005 space debris model which is currently under development by the Institute of Aerospace Systems and QinetiQ (UK) under ESA contract.

AB Multiphysics simulations are playing an increasingly important role in computational science and engineering for applications ranging from aircraft design to medical treatments. These simulations require integration of techniques and tools from multiple disciplines, and in turn demand new advanced technologies to integrate independently developed physics solvers effectively. In this paper, we describe some numerical, geometrical, and system software components required by such integration, with a concrete case study of detailed, three-dimensional, parallel rocket simulations involving system-level interactions among fluid, solid, and combustion, as well as subsystem-level interactions. We package these components into a software framework that provides common-refinement based methods for transferring data between potentially non-matching meshes, novel and robust face-offsetting methods for tracking Lagrangian surface meshes, as well as integrated support for parallel mesh optimization, remeshing, algebraic manipulations, performance monitoring, and high-level data management and I/O. From these general, reusable framework components we construct domain-specific building blocks to facilitate integration of parallel, multiphysics simulations from high-level specifications that are easy to read and can also be visualized graphically. These reusable building blocks are integrated with independently developed physics codes to perform various multiphysics simulations.

AB The destruction of chemical weapons is a hazardous operation. The degree of hazard posed, however, is not uniform and is dependent on the specific chemical agent and the configuration of the weapon or bulk storage vessel in which it is contained. For example, a highly volatile nerve agent in an explosively configured munition, such as a rocket, poses a very different hazard from that of a bulk storage container of viscous mustard gas. Equally the handling of recovered, often highly corroded, World War (WW)I or WWII chemical munitions will pose a very different hazard from that associated with dealing with modern chemical weapons stored under the appropriate conditions. Over the years, a number of technologies have been developed for the destruction of chemical weapons. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. None of them of the associated risks, therefore, it is important to give due consideration and weight to these differences. To ensure that the destruction technology selected takes due account of them and that the resulting overall risk assessment accurately reflects the actual risks involved.

AB Based on requirements for a next-generation rocket test facility, elements of a prototype intelligent rocket test facility (IRTF) have been implemented. The preliminary results provide the basis for future advanced development and validation using rocket test stand facilities at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Key components include distributed smart sensor elements integrated using a knowledge-driven environment. One of the specific goals is to imbue sensors with the intelligence needed to perform self-diagnosis of health and to participate in a hierarchy of health determination at sensor, process, and system levels. We have identified issues important to further development of health-enabled networks, which should be of interest to others working with smart sensors and intelligent health management systems.

AB Strategic ballistic missiles are the long-range missiles designed to intercept stationary, defined targets. Guidance is in the boost phase which represents only a small fraction of the total time of flight of the missile. A missile has to be guided and steered to the required position and velocity states at the end of the boost phase. The problem of guiding a vehicle in atmospheric phase in the presence of drag and lift, poses a challenge for the designer. This paper describes an energy management guidance scheme for guiding the vehicle in atmospheric phase of the flight. The estimated drag is taken care of by the guidance scheme. Uncertainty in velocity due to drag or impulse variation at the end of the boost phase are corrected by an augmented velocity package. A closed-loop guidance scheme has been used during this phase also. A ballistic re-entry has been considered for this design study.

AB Yellow rocket, Barbarea vulgaris (R. Br.) variety arcuata, was evaluated as a trap crop for diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), in cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. variety capitata, in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, the numbers of P. xylostella larvae found in field plots of cabbage alone were 5.2-11.3 times higher than those on cabbage plants in plots that included cabbage and several rows of yellow rocket. In an outdoor experiment in screenhouses, P. xylostella oviposition on cabbage was compared among six treatments that varied in the percentage of yellow rocket in relation to cabbage (0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32% of the plants were yellow rocket). Results indicated that the percentage of eggs laid on cabbage decreased as the percentage of yellow rocket in the treatment increased, but this decrease was not significant beyond 20% of the plants being yellow rocket. In 2004, the numbers of P. xylostella larvae in field plots of cabbage alone were 1.6-2.4 and 1.7-2.8 times higher than numbers in treatments with 10 and 20% trap crop, respectively. Sticky trap and sweep net captures of P. xylostella adults indicated that within-field dispersal was reduced by the presence of yellow rocket and aggregation occurred around yellow rocket plants. Our study suggests that using yellow rocket as a trap crop may reduce P. xylostella infestations in cabbage fields, and this possibility is discussed in the context of general crop and insect pest management practices in crucifers.

AB This paper presents in brief the formulation used for the studies of lateral and longitudinal dynamics associated with separation and pull out of an ongoing functional stage from the spent stage of a multistage launch vehicle using retro rockets as jettisoning system. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed to solve the governing nonlinear differential equations of motion to obtain the state vectors of the separating bodies. A statistical method is adapted to account for the off nominal design parameters of the bodies undergoing separation and the jettisoning system. The tolerances in magnitude of the pull out time, relative velocity, lateral gap and longitudinal clearances between the separating bodies were used to find out the nonoccurrence of collision between the separating bodies. This procedure helps in designing and adapting a suitable jettisoning system to achieve collision free separation of multistage launch vehicle stages. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mission of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes to enable improved prediction of climate. weather. and natural hazards for present and future generations. The ESE has an end-to-end strategy to assure that information. understanding. and capabilities derived from its research program achieve maximum usefulness to the scientific and decision-making communities. Small satellites (< 500 kg) have been crucial contributors to satisfying the research strategy since the inception of NASA's Earth observation program in the 1960s. In the last decade, NASA's ESE has placed a renewed emphasis on small satellites. This reemphasis reflects advancements in compact sensor, small satellite bus. and launch vehicle technologies in addition to management innovations. Near term and advanced planning suggest that this trend will continue. A number of related small satellite missions have been recently launched, are in development. or are planned. Multi-satellite constellations under study include small satellites as key architectural elements. Studies indicate that low cost. capable microspacecraft along with compact sensors and increased autonomy are technology enablers to the sensorwebs and associated distributed spacecraft infrastructure required to realize the long-term NASA Earth Science Vision (ESV).

AB It is believed that a potential means for further significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results also in a stimulation of launch rates of small satellites, is to make the launcher reusable. to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Therefore, not only launching small satellites with expendable rocket on non-regular flights but also with reusable rockets on regular flights should be considered for the long term. However. developing. producing and operating reusable rockets require a fundamental change in the current "business as usual" philosophy. Under current conditions, it might not be possible to develop, to produce or to operate a reusable vehicle fleet economically. The favorite philosophy is based on "smart business" processes adapted by the author using cost engineering techniques. In the following paper, major strategies for reducing costs are discussed. which are applied for a representative program proposal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To track the three-dimensional behavior of liquid surfaces in storage tanks on orbit, a numerical scheme based on the level set method was developed. For the verification of the numerical methods, experimental data were acquired through the observation of the unsteady deformations of liquid surfaces in cylindrical containers under low-gravity conditions in a drop tower. Primary emphasis was placed on the dynamic behavior of the liquid surface and the displacement of the contact line on the solid wall. Based on the results, the boundary condition for surface tension was discussed and the model of wetting phenomena was adequately introduced into the computation. Compared with the experimental data, the corresponding numerical results showed good agreement. With the developed code, the flowfields at the draining process in the liquid oxygen (LOchi) tank for the upper-stage propulsion system of an H-IIA launch vehicle under low-gravity conditions were also investigated. It was found that the buoyancy induced by a slight acceleration was efficient to prevent dip growth and that the serviceable propellant in the launch-vehicle tank could thereby be increased in a realistic situation.

AB A Post-Flight Investigation was initiated by the European Space Agency to analyze impacts on solar arrays of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), exposed to space for 8.25 years at approximately 600 km altitude. The solar cells deployed during the first Service Mission (SM-1 in December 1993) were retrieved in March 2002 as part of Service Mission 3B (SM-313). A sub-panel of 2 m(2) was cut from the arrays for subsequent selection and removal of individual solar cells for analysis. Six cells (4.8 x 10(-3) m(2)) were surveyed for flux of all craters of sizes greater than 5 microns. Analytical scanning electron microscopy was used to analyse residues in 111 features of 3-4000 micron conchoidal detachment diameter (D-co), examined on 23 solar cells. Eighty three show identifiable residue: 38 are Space Debris impacts and 45 Micrometeoroid impacts. Of the remaining 28, 2 contain residue of ambiguous origin, 1 is probably a minor manufacturing flaw, 1 is obscured by contamination, and 24 are unresolved, lacking recognizable residue.
   The majority of space debris impacts on the SM-3B cells are less than 80 microns D-co, dominated by Al-rich residue, probably of solid rocket motor origin, although three may be due to sodium metal droplet impacts. Three larger features include paint pigment and binder, ferrous alloy, and possible carbon-fibre composite material debris.
   Micrometeoroid residues are found across the entire crater size range and dominate features of between 100 and 1000 microns, their residues are similar to those found in earlier SM-1 surveys. Fe- and Mg-rich silicates dominate; Fe sulphides are common and there are occasional vesicular Ni- and S-bearing mafic silicates of hydrous phyllosilicate origin. A single sodium aluminosilicate residue and one Fe Ni metal residue were found; as well as enigmatic Mg- and S-bearing residues, all considered as probably of micrometeoroid origin. A few Fe-, O- and C-bearing residues were classified as of ambiguous origin. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

DE space debris; mitigation; geosynchronous transfer orbit
AB Missions to geosynchronous orbits remain one of the most important elements of space launch traffic, accounting for 40% of all missions to Earth orbit and beyond during the four-year period 2000-2003. The vast majority of these missions leave one or more objects in geosynchronous transfer orbits (GTOs), contributing oil a short-term or long-term basis to the space debris population. National and international space debris mitigation guidelines seek to curtail the accumulation of debris in orbits which penetrate the regions of low Earth orbit and of geosynchronous orbit. The orbital lifetime of objects in GTO can be greatly influenced by the initial values of perigee, inclination, and right ascension of the orbital plane, leading to orbital lifetimes of from less than one month to more than 100 years. An examination of the characteristic GTOs employed by launch vehicles from around the world has been conducted. The consequences of using perigees above 300 km and super-synchronous apogees, typically above 40,000 km, have been identified. In addition, the differences in orbital behavior of launch vehicle stages and mission-related debris in GTOs have been investigated. Greater coordination and cooperation between space launch service providers and spacecraft designers and owners could significantly improve overall compliance with guidelines to mitigate the accumulation of debris in Earth orbit.

DT Article
AB The second-generation reusable launch vehicle will incorporate sophisticated new guidance and control methods to increase the system's flexibility, in particular making it a practical vehicle for unmanned cargo missions. This project focuses on trajectory design and guidance for the terminal area energy management phase of flight, where traditional methods have produced limited results. Fuzzy logic methods are used to make onboard autonomous gliding return trajectory design robust to the possibility of control surface failures, thus, increasing the flexibility of unmanned gliding recovery and landing. Fuzzy inference systems are used to design the trajectory and provide guidance commands for the vehicle bank angle and negative z axis acceleration. Fuzzy logic provides a practical means of incorporating conflicting objectives and constraints in choosing trajectory parameters. The method has the flexibility to choose these parameters from a continuum of possible values. The design is validated using a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom simulation of the X-33 technology demonstrator.

TI Cost and efficacy comparison of integrated pest management strategies

SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY

DT Article
DE Blattella germanica; IPM; public housing
ID INNER-CITY CHILDREN; ORTHOPTERA; INFESTATIONS
AB The long-term costs and efficacy of two treatment methodologies for German cockroach. Blattella germanica (L.). control were compared in the public housing environment. The "traditional" treatment for German cockroaches consisted of monthly baseboard and crack and crevice treatment (TBCC) by using spray and dust formulation insecticides. The integrated pest management treatment (IPM) involved initial vacuuming of apartments followed by monthly or quarterly applications of baits and insect growth regulator (IGR) devices. Cockroach populations in the IPM treatment were also monitored with sticky traps. Technician time and the amount of product applied were used to measure cost in both treatments. Twenty-four hour sticky trap catch was used as all indicator of treatment efficacy. The cost of the IPM treatment was found to be significantly greater than the traditional treatment, particularly at the initiation of the test. In the first month (clean-out), the average cost per apartment unit was $14.60, whereas the average cost of a TBCC unit was $2.75. In the second month of treatment, the average cost of IPM was still significantly greater than the TBCC cost. However, after month 4 the cost of the two treatments was no longer significantly different because many of the IPM apartments were moved to a quarterly treatment schedule. To evaluate the long-term costs of the two treatments over the entire year, technician time and product quantities were averaged over all units treated within the 12-mo test period (total 600 U per treatment). The average per unit cost of the IPM treatment was ($4.06). The average IPM cost was significantly greater than that of the TBCC treatment at $1.50 per unit. Although the TBCC was significantly less expensive than the IPM treatment, it was also less effective. Trap catch data indicated that the TBCC treatment had little. if any;. effect oil the cockroach populations over the course of the year. Cockroach populations in the TBCC treatment remained steady for the first 5 mo of the test and then had a threefold increase during the summer. Cockroach populations in the IPM treatment were significantly reduced from all averaue of 24.7 cockroaches per unit before treatment to all average 3.9 cockroaches per unit in month 4. The suppressed cockroach populations (<5 per unit) in the IPM treatment remained constant for the remaining 8 mo of the test.

TI Autonomous safety and reliability features of the K-1 avionics system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Kistler Aerospace Corporation is developing the K-1, a fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Both stages return to the launch site using parachutes and airbags. Initial flight operations will occur from Woomera, Australia. K-I guidance is performed autonomously. Each stage of the K-I employs a triplex, fault tolerant avionics architecture, including three fault tolerant computers and three radiation hardened Embedded GPS/INS units with a hardware voter. The K-1 has an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system on each stage residing in the three vehicle computers based on similar systems in commercial aircraft. During first-stage ascent, the IVHM system performs an Instantaneous Impact Prediction (IIP) calculation 25 times per second, initiating an abort in the event the vehicle is outside a predetermined safety corridor for at least 3 consecutive calculations. In this event, commands are issued to terminate thrust, separate the stages, dump all propellant in the first-stage, and initiate a normal landing sequence. The second-stage flight computer calculates its ability to reach orbit along its state vector, initiating an abort sequence similar to the first stage if it cannot. On a nominal mission, following separation, the second-stage also performs calculations to assure its impact point is within a safety corridor.
   The K-1's guidance and control design is being tested through simulation with hardware-in-the-loop at Draper Laboratory. Kistler's verification strategy assures reliable and safe operation of the K-1. (C) 2003 Kistler Aerospace Corporation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on high level safety and cost requirements, system architects and subsystem engineers are called upon to provide requirements at a lower level during the conceptual design phase of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). This paper describes an event tree based methodology for quantitatively assessing the limits of some of the lower-level Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) requirements during RLV conceptual design. The metrics assessed in the paper are fault detection coverage, false alarm probability, fault isolation capability, probability of IVHM failing to detect a fault, and safety allocation. The fault detection and isolation metrics were assessed based on their applicability with respect to cost and safety in the mission and turnaround phase of the RLV operations. The paper shows that the mission-phase requirement for IVHM fault detection coverage for a subsystem is large (more stringent) when IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, the failure remediation probability is small, and the subsystem is already reliable. The requirement on IVHM false alarm rate in the mission phase is small (more stringent) when the subsystem is reliable, IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, and IVHM should cause fewer false aborts.
   The paper concludes by stressing the use of appropriate system analysis and optimization in allocating IVHM requirements to a subsystem of the RLV. Although the paper is written from an IVHM and RLV perspective, it is targeted towards system engineers/architects who are interested in estimating the effects of fault detection and isolation requirements during conceptual design.

AB The NASA Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program is evaluating various concepts for less expensive and reduced-risk access to space. Critical to these goals are more reliable and easily maintained vehicles, with high fidelity Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) systems, rapid turn-around time and dual-use technology. The initial application of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) on the Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) Architecture 6 Concept has helped to define key assumptions necessary to make the development of the Architecture 6 concept successful. While the final figures of merit (FOMs) will be based on successfully developing and testing the vehicle, preliminary FOMs can be used now for basic trades between propulsion and staging concepts, thus providing a valuable tool to evaluate the overall trade space between highly divergent concepts. Reliability analysis, Probabilistic Design Methods (PDM), and Probabilistic Risk Assessment can be integrated to evaluate overall systems architecture, a complete mission model, and a fleet logistics model. In addition, the PRA may be used to evaluate and compare a high and low energy crew escape system.

DE space debris; orbital breakup event; fragment velocity additions
AB The estimation of velocity changes in an orbital breakup event of any space object is an important activity in the field of space debris. There are various methods described in the literature to estimate velocity additions. In one method, the normal, radial and tangential components of fragment velocity additions are estimated from the differences in semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination with respect to those of parent object. Unfortunately, when the parent orbit has small eccentricity or the breakup occurs either near apogee or near perigee, the computation of radial component of velocity increment encounters a singularity and hence is prone to errors because of imperfect orbital element data. In another method, velocity increments are estimated from semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascension of the ascending node and true anomaly of fragments as well as parent at the time of breakup. It is very difficult to obtain the true anomaly of the fragments at the time of breakup by propagating the element sets of debris pieces backward in time owing to uncertainties in orbital elements and drag parameters. Moreover, whenever the apogee of the fragment orbit becomes less than the perigee of the parent orbit due to various perturbations or errors, this method does not yield any solution for the radial component of the velocity increment. In this paper, first, a linear method is described to estimate the components of velocity addition, utilizing relations involving the differences in semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and argument of perigee in a particular combination and sequence, which avoids the singularity in the computation. Later, a fully nonlinear method to obtain velocity additions without any assumption is presented, which is found to be superior to any of the methods described in the literature so far.

TI An airspace planning and collaborative decision-making model: Part I -

SO TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE

DT Article
ID FREE-FLIGHT
AB We present a large-scale, airspace planning and collaborative decision-making model (APCDM) to enhance the management of the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). Given a set of flights that must be scheduled during some planning horizon, along with alternative surrogate trajectories for each flight as prompted by various airspace restriction scenarios imposed by dynamic severe weather systems or space launch special use airspaces (SUA), we develop a mixed-integer programming model to select a set of flight plans from among these alternatives, subject to flight safety, air traffic control workload, and airline equity constraints. The model includes a three-dimensional probabilistic conflict analysis, the derivation of valid inequalities, the development of air traffic control workload metrics, and the consideration of equity among airline carriers in absorbing costs related to rerouting, delays, and possible cancellations. The resulting APCDM model has potential use for both tactical and strategic applications, such as air traffic control in response to severe weather phenomena or spacecraft launches, FAA policy evaluation (separation standards, workload restrictions, sectorization. strategies), Homeland Defense contingency planning, and military air campaign planning. The model can also serve a useful role in augmenting the FANS National Playbook of standardized flight profiles in different disruption-prone regions of the national airspace. The present paper focuses on the theory and model development; Part II of this paper will address model parameter estimations and implementation test results.

AB Field experiments were carried out at the Facultad de Agronomia, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina (34degrees25'S, 58degrees25'W), to evaluate the possibility of reducing weed seedling emergence through the use of alfalfa cultivars with low levels of winter dormancy and by increasing plant density from 200 to 400 plants m(-2). It was hypothesized that these treatments would alter the temperature regime and the red (R)-far-red (FR) ratio of radiation to which seeds were exposed. Responses to management treatments were recorded for bull thistle, cotton thistle, plumeless thistle, tall rocket, mustard, curly dock, and pigweed. During the alfalfa establishment year, pigweed and curly dock emergence was reduced by the nondormant cultivar established at high density. This reduction disappeared when soil beneath the canopy was fitted with heaters that mimicked bare-soil temperatures. Crop canopy presence during the establishment year was not effective in reducing mustard, cotton thistle, bull thistle, plumeless thistle, and tall rocket emergence. During the second and third years after crop establishment, the canopy of the nondormant alfalfa cultivar was effective in reducing germination of weed seeds placed on the soil surface during fall and winter. In contrast, the winter-dormant cultivar allowed the establishment of weeds during the winter period. These reductions in weed emergence were associated with a modification in the R-FR ratio perceived by the seeds located at the soil surface and could largely be removed by using FR filters to increase the R-FR ratio. These results suggest that the selection of a nondormant cultivar combined with an increase in plant density could effectively reduce weed populations in alfalfa.

ID UNITS
AB Background: A new pneumatic tube system to transport red blood cell concentrates (RBCC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was to be evaluated, followed by integration into the quality management system. Material and Methods: First, with the pneumatic tube system we transported 12 RBCC on day 35 after production. We estimated hemoglobin, hemolysis rate, ATP, potassium, LDH and lactate of the RBCC before and after transportation. In a second experiment, we transported 12 RBCC on day 10 after production. We tested these 12 RBCC for hemolysis rate, potassium and ATP, and compared them to 12 RBCC of the control group on days 10, 20, 30, and 35 after production. At the end of storage, all were tested for bacterial contamination. 36 FFP units were transported in frozen state over the same distance. Upon thawing, the samples were tested for factor VIII, antithrombin activity, and sterility. Results. The pneumatic tube transport of RBCC at the end of their usability and on day 10 after production including storage did not lead to any significant differences with regard to the tested parameters before and after transport. Factor VIII and antithrombin activities in all FFP units were between 70-100%. All 36 FFP were sterile and not damaged by the transportation. Conclusion: Transport of RBCC and FFP in a pneumatic tube did not have any negative effect on the quality and storage stability of the products. By using this pneumatic tube system, blood products can be transported safely, fast and efficiently within a clinical center.

ID ANGULAR-RATE ESTIMATION
AB Methods are developed for estimating the rotation rate of a spacecraft using only measured magnetic field data. The goal is to provide rate information for use in applications such as detumbling, nutation damping, and momentum management without using gyroscopes. Two algorithms are developed, a deterministic algorithm and an extended Kalman filter. Both algorithms employ the magnetic field direction kinematics equation and Euler's equation for attitude motion of a rigid body with momentum wheels. Neither algorithm requires a model of the Earth's magnetic field. The deterministic algorithm solves a nonlinear least-squares problem for the unknown angular momentum component along the magnetic field direction. The extended Kalman filter estimates the attitude rate vector, corrections to five of the six inertia matrix elements, and two error states of the measured magnetic field direction. It uses an initial rate estimate from the deterministic algorithm to avoid divergence. The algorithms have been tested using data from a spinning sounding rocket. They achieve initial accuracies in the range 2-7 deg/s when the rocket spins at about 80 deg/s, and their accuracies improve to 1-2 deg/s after the spin rate decays to 20 deg/s. These results indicate a lower bound on the ratio of the error to the nominal spin rate, which suggests that dynamic modeling error is the dominant source of uncertainty.

TI Twice-running-speed response due to elliptical bearing clearances
SO JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB Yamamoto [1] examined a vertical Jeffcott rotor model with bearing clearances and showed that a small bearing "dead-band" clearance could have a dramatic influence on synchronous rotor response. Recent test results for a turbopump in a liquid-rocket-engine development program showed a twice-running-speed response (2E) on the order of 8 gs over a wide speed range, while synchronous response levels were only at an 0.5 g level. Childs [2] predicted a sharp 2E response for the Advanced Technology Development, High-Pressure Fuel Turbopump (ATD-HPFTP) of the Space Shuttle Main Engine due to bearing clearances, when the running speed was nearly one half of a housing-mode natural frequency, i.e., when the 2E frequency was close to the housing mode natural frequency. However, his model did not predict significant 2E response over a broad running-speed range. Ellipticity of the bearing dead-band clearances was suggested as a possible cause for the observed 2E phenomenon. An extension of Yamamoto's analysis [I] is presented including bearing ellipticity to examine that proposed explanation. The analysis results show that clearance ellipticity will produce 2E response over a considerable running-speed range during which the bearing clearance is engaged; however, the predicted 2E-response amplitude corresponding to an ellipticity of 0.1 were about 10% of the synchronous levels, and the projected 2E acceleration levels were about 40% of synchronous. The predicted 2E response includes a resonance peak (that can be sharp) at speeds slightly above 25% of the rotor critical speed. The perturbation-analysis results provide an explanation for persistent, lower 2E-response levels observed in many turbopumps, but do not explain the high levels observed with thin turbopump.

This paper addresses the improvements of the MASTER model by consideration of also non-fragmentation debris down to 1 mum in diameter. For this purpose, debris generated by solid rocket motor firings, surface degradation particles, impact ejecta, and NaK droplets released by nuclear reactors in space are currently being implemented in the model. All debris sources are considered from LEO up to the geosynchronous region. The new MASTER debris population is analysed in terms of the spatial distribution and resulting object flux, and it is compared with measurement data. Although the number of man-made objects represented in the model has been increased significantly, it is shown that the required resources to run the model are acceptable in terms of computer time and storage. The new model architecture, especially the parametric source term description, enables effective maintenance and model upgrade in response to ongoing debris measurements and source model improvements. The user branch of the MASTER model now provides a graphical interface for all platforms supported. (C) 2002 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID COLLISION
AB Opik's analytical expressions relate in a simple way the semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination of the projectile orbit to the magnitude and direction of the relative velocity vector at impact on a given target on circular orbit. These interesting quantities, along with the impact probability of any given projectile, can be all represented on a suitable projection giving a comprehensive picture of the impact risk on the selected target. By means of this theory a complete analysis of the impact risk on the International Space Station (ISS) is performed. It is found that the large majority of the debris population is on orbits such that a correlation exists between their impact velocity on the ISS and the angle between the velocity vector of the impactor and that of the ISS. The impactor population also is separated in terms of nature of the projectiles, with most of the low-medium velocity ones being particles related to solid rocket motor slag condensates. On the other hand, the highest velocity projectiles are composed mainly by fragments of past in-orbit explosions.
   The flux of projectiles on the ISS has been calculated for the planned operative lifetime of the Station, by assuming a realistic scenario of the future debris environment evolution and the actual planned altitude profile for the ISS mission. There is a factor 2-3 variation of the flux due to the changing ISS altitude. The most dangerous part of the mission appears to be the central one, when the ISS will orbit at about 450 km above the Earth.

ID HYDROSTATIC BEARINGS
AB Test results are presented for the rotordynamic coefficients of a hybrid bearing that is representative of bearings for liquid-rocket-engine turbopump applications. The bearing is tested in the following two degraded conditions: (a) one of five orifices plugged, and (b) a locally enlarged clearance to simulate a worn condition. Test data are presented at 24,600 rpm, with supply pressures of 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 MPa, and eccentricity ratios from 0.1 to 0.5 in 0.1 increments. Overall, the results suggest that neither a single plugged orifice nor significant wear on the bearing land will "disable" a well-designed hybrid bearing. These results do not speak to multiple plugged orifices and are not an endorsement for operations without filters to prevent plugging orifices.

AB The floating ring seal is often used in an oxidizer and a fuel pump of the turbo pump unit in the liquid rocket engine because the floating ring seal has the ability to minimize clearance without rubbing phenomenon, For the analysis of performance and vibration characteristics of the turbo pump unit with floating ring seals, the exact prediction of the lock-up position of the floating ring is essential to evaluate the leakage and rotordynamic coefficients from the floating ring seal. The governing equations, which are based on the 'bulk-flow model', are derived from extending the eccentric annular plain seal analysis. The solution procedure is developed by using the Fast Fourier Transform Method of Nelson and Nguyen. The results of lock-up position, attitude angle of the floating ring, leakage flow rate, and rotordynamic coefficients are presented with operating conditions and geometric parameters of the floating ring seal for an example case.

AB The increasing importance of rocket Eruca spp. as a leaf and oil crop, and especially as a Fourth Generation vegetable, calls for a better understanding of several basic aspects of its biology. Knowledge on seed germination behaviour is necessary to optimize the management of the plant in the field and in seedbanks. Seed germination of several samples of rocket was assayed in the laboratory under different incubation conditions. Germination in the two studied populations was fairly high, ranging from 68% to 96%. However, remarkable variation was found within one of them according to the date of collection of the sample, ranging from 78-96% for those collected in summer (LG1 and LG2) to 21-29% for that collected in autumn (LG3). Neither time of storage nor GA(3) treatments had any significant effect on this low percentage, which could only be significantly improved with scarification, up to 47% by dry heat and up to 66% by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Dormancy and low seed viability probably originating from effects of environmental factors during seed formation and maturation seem to play a role in the low germination percentage of sample LG3.

The Millennium Commission funded project has set a new benchmark for urban regeneration, not only for its skillful reuse of redundant infrastructure but also for its innovative approaches to structural design, internal climate control and contamination management. It features a 40 m high 'bubble-wrapped' rocket tower, a complex combination of naturally vented and air-conditioned internal spaces and a large, unden-vented car-parking area to cover the most contaminated parts of the site.

AB Mission success depends on proper integration of safety, risk management, and assurance processes throughout the project life-cycle. In the current government acquisition environment great emphasis is being placed on innovative contracting approaches that involve cooperative agreements, performance-based contracting, and contractor use of best practices. Thus, far fewer prescribed standards and specifications are involved in government acquisition today as compared to the early 1990's. Additionally, the shift from rule-based assurance management to knowledge-based approaches poses a separate set of challenges as clearly underscored in government and industry accident assessments and mishap investigations that followed a costly streak of launch vehicle and spacecraft failures in the late 1990 time frame. In response to these challenges the NASA Off-ice of Safety & Mission Assurance began development of the Process Based Mission Assurance Knowledge Management System (PBMA-K-MS) in mid 1999. The PBMA-KMS is a user-friendly, web-based system designed to support life-cycle safety and mission success management, This paper describes the PBMA-KMS functionality, operation, and plans for future growth. Aerospace professionals are encouraged to use the PBMA-KMS by participating in discipline oriented work groups, and contributing best practices, lessons teamed, and ideas for future functional enhancements.

AB Prior to the retrieval in 1993 from low Earth orbit (LEO), the " -V2" Solar Array wing of the Hubble Space Telescope was exposed to hypervelocity impacts (micrometre to millimetre scale) from both micrometeoroids and space debris. The initial survey of the damage (100-3500mum diameter sized craters) identified that micrometeoroid remnants dominated the flux in the 100-1000mum size regime, with debris dominating >1000mum. These residues were composed of remnants of silicate minerals, calcite, metal sulfides and metals that often appeared as complex poly-mineralic melts within melt pits. A further survey of 10-100mum diameter craters identified that the most common chemistry was space debris with the crossover from meteoroids to debris being at around 30mum D-CO. Residues include remnants of specialised steels and paint fragments but the dominant type is aluminium and aluminium oxide, which are almost certainly remnants of solid rocket motor operations. It is found that the relative contribution of debris as a function of size, agrees remarkably with a prediction derived using flux data from Long Duration Exposure Facility and a meteoroid model.

TI Magnetohydrodynamics energy bypass scramjet performance with real gas
   effects
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The theoretical performance of a scramjet propulsion system incorporating a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy bypass scheme is calculated. The one-dimensional analysis developed earlier, in which the theoretical performance is calculated neglecting skin friction and using a sudden-freezing approximation for the nozzle flow, is modified to incorporate the method of Van Driest for turbulent skin friction and a finite-rate chemistry calculation in the nozzle. Unlike in the earlier design, in which four ramp compressions occurred in the pitch plane, in the present design the first two ramp compressions occur in the pitch plane, and the next two compressions occur in the yaw plane. The results for the simplified design of a spaceliner show that 1) skin friction substantially reduces thrust and specific impulse and 2) the specific impulse of the MHD-bypass system is still better than the non-MHD system and typical rocket over a range of flight speeds and design parameters. Results suggest that the energy management with MHD principles offers the possibility of improving the performance of the scramjet for the spaceliner application and for the globecruiser application. The technical issues needing further studies are identified.

AB Background: A low serum level (< 100 mg/L) of the actin-scavenger Gc-globulin is a prognostic marker of non-survival in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). It is unknown whether decreased production or increased consumption (or both) is responsible for the low Gc-globulin levels. Methods: Ten patients with FHF and four patients with acute or chronic liver disease (AOCLD) with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grades II-IV were included. Eight patients with cirrhosis (chronic liver disease. CLD) without HE served as controls. Total, free, and actin-bound Gc-globulin were measured in samples from an artery, a central vein, and a hepatic vein. In 12 patients (9 FHF, 3 AOCLD), concentrations were measured before and after high volume plasmapheresis (HVP). Results: Total Gc-globulin was reduced to 21%, 40%, and 43% of the normal level in the FHF, AOCLD, and CLD groups, respectively, whereas bound Gc-globulin was within normal range in all patients. The Gc:actin complex ratio was increased 3.8. 2.5, and 1.9-fold compared with normal levels. Total, free, and bound serum Gc-globulin levels did not differ among arterial, systemic venous, or hepatic venous blood. Total Ge-globulin rose to >100 mg/L in all patients after HVP, whereas bound Gc-globulin remained unchanged. The Gc-globulin production rate in FHF and AOCLD patients was increased to 4.1 +/- 1.3 mg/min compared to literature values of 0.6 mg/min in healthy individuals. The estimated half-life of total Gc-globulin was shorter in the patients compared to healthy individuals (127 +/- 56 min and 870 min, respectively). Conclusions: Gc-globulin levels were reduced in patients with FHF and AOCLD because a 7-fold increase of Gc-globulin production rate could not compensate for the accelerated clearance. Bound Gc-globulin was maintained within normal levels in all circumstances studied, indicating a possible regulatory role of this parameter in the clearance of actin.

TI Tethers and debris mitigation

CL RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL
AB In recent years, the use of tethers has been proposed for reduction of space debris either through momentum transfer or use of electrodynamic effects. Tethers have been shown to at least theoretically allow for quick, elegant and cost-effective deorbit of defunct satellites or spent stages. On the other hand, the large risk that tethers themselves may pose to other satellites in orbit has been recognized as well. The large collision area of tethers, combined with operational hazards and meteoroid risk may result in a large orbital exposure. For example, in 1997, the ESA/Dutch 35-km tether deployment of YES from TEAMSAT was inhibited after an analysis of the collision risk for the case the tether operation would fail. The question rises how these two points of view compare to eachother. This paper intends to highlight a representative selection of the proposed tether applications while taking into account the added risks caused by the tethers themselves.
   Typical applications from recent literature will be briefly described, such as an Ariane 502 spent stage re-entry from GTO and the concept of deboost of defunct satellites by interaction of a conductive tether with the Earth magnetic field.
   Mass savings of the tethered systems versus conventional equivalents will be evaluated.
   Based on a crude risk analysis, involving elements such as mission complexity, dynamic stability, meteoroid risk and orbital life time, a general outline of limiting factors can be given for the various applications. Special attention is reserved for implementation of mechanisms that help reduce this tether risk, such as the DUtether (Tether Degradable by Ultraviolet), utilization of airdrag and solar pressure, the effect of residual current in bare tethers, tether retrieval etc.
   It is proposed how a net tether-induced mitigation can be compared to that of conventional alternatives, i.e. deboost by rocket engine or a completely passive approach.
   This comparison is put in the perspective of an ever-increasing occupation of the space environment.
   It is concluded that tethers can in fact help mitigate the debris risk and that for each application a useful niche can be defined. It is argued that eliminating pollution directly after use of the precious resource of space is not only good custom, but also an important way to make the risk of debris controllable and independent of future trends. Although tethers may have large exposure in terms of area-time product, they deliver a quick cleaning service that may be appreciated by the future users of space. (C) 2001 Delta-Utec SRC.

AB The Cosmic Dust/Space Debris impact detector GORID has now collected data for more than 3 years from its geostationary location at 80degrees East. The aperture size is 0.1 m(2) and the instrument is capable of detecting particles with a mass down to about 10-14 g (velocity dependent). The registered number of likely impact events per day ranged from 0 to more than 40 with an average around 2 per day. Many impacts occurred clustered in time and these clustered events sometimes reappeared for one or more days. It is suggested that these clustered events result from impacts of clouds of exhaust particles from the firing of solid rocket motors (SRM). For the specific case of an insertion burn into geostationary orbit on 10th June 1998 a detailed simulation of the SRM cloud evolution and expected impacts on GORED is performed. The results of this analysis are consistent with GORED measurements 11 days after the thruster firing. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of individual solar cells removed from the returned array from the Hubble Space Telescope have yielded results on the residue chemistry of material preserved in impact features within the 1-3500mum. size range. The initial survey of impact craters in the 100-3500mum size range identified that micrometeoroids were the dominant precursor chemistry. The second survey of impact features between 1-100 mum identified space debris as the prevailing precursor chemistry. The categories of space debris remnants observed in this size range were dominated by aluminium and aluminium oxide chemistries indicative of solid rocket motor fuel debris. The results from the residue chemistry surveys have now been compared with a prediction derived from LDEF data and meteoroid modelling, and there is general agreement between the modelling and actual observations.

ID STREAMS
AB MASTER-99 is a space debris and meteoroid environment model produced by TU Braunschweig (D), eta_max space (D), and DERA (U-K) under an ESA contract. The model allows to compute particulate impact fluxes on any terrestrial target orbit up to geostationary altitudes. Flux contributions can be discriminated with respect to debris source types (catalog objects, explosion and collision fragments, NaK droplets, solid rocket motor dust and slag, impact ejecta, and surface degradation products), meteoroid source types (Divine-Staubach populations, and annual stream events), and with respect to origin and impact direction of each flux contributing particulate. Impact fluxes of meteoroids and debris down to 1 gm sizes can be determined for spherical targets, for tumbling plates, or for oriented, planar surfaces which are controlled according to standard attitude steering laws. MASTER-99 is distributed by ESA/ESOC on a CD ROM which includes user documentation, and the necessary data files, executables, and GUI driven installation scripts for the most common operating systems and computer platforms. MASTER-99 is delivered together with PROOF-99, a program for radar and optical observation forecasting. Based on the MASTER-99 population larger than 1 mm, it predicts debris detections from ground-based or space-based sensors (radars or telescopes) of user-defined system performances. (C) 2001 COSPAR.
