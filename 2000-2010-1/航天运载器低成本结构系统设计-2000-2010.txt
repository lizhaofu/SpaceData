ID DEVELOPED CAVITATION; FLOWS
AB This study was led in collaboration with the French Space Agency (CNES) and the Rocket Engine Division of Snecma. The main aims were the simulations and the analyses of cavitating flows in the rocket engine turbopump inducers, where the operating fluids are LH2 and LOx under cryogenic conditions. A rho(P, T) state law modeling the cavitation phenomenon was integrated by the laboratory LEGI in the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FINE/TURBO (TM), developed by Numeca International. Various 3D numerical results are given for an inducer geometry and comparisons are made with experimental data (head drop curves) obtained by NASA. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4002886]

AB Large structural problems with high precision and complexity require a high-performance computation using the efficient parallel algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to present the parallel performance of thermal-structural coupled analysis tested on a parallel cluster system. In the coupled analysis, the heat transfer analysis is carried out, and then the structural analysis is performed based on temperature distribution. For the automatic and efficient connection of two parallel analysis modules, the several communication patterns were studied. The parallel performance was demonstrated for the sample and the real application problems, such as a laminated composite material by the DNS(Direct Numerical Simulation) approach and an aerospace launch vehicle model.

TI High-Performance Rocket Nozzle Concept
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB An innovative technical solution that overcomes the limitation induced by flow separation phenomena and allows increasing the vacuum-specific impulse of a main stage rocket engine is presented. After reviewing the open technical literature on flow separation and advance nozzles design, the newly proposed concept is extensively presented. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analyses and experimental results (cold gas subscale models) demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple device, adaptable to any bell-shaped nozzle and which provides a solution to the flow separation issue, while increasing vacuum-specific impulse performances for booster and main stage engines. Moreover, this new concept gives rise to a wider engine-throttling range, even at low altitude, without incurring flow separation and associated side loads. Experimental data show a potential for favorable behavior even during transient phases, allowing significant reduction on transient side-loads activity. Finally, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics computations have been extended to the hot tiring case (chemically reactive hydrogen/oxygen propellants), both in steady-state and transient conditions. The results show the suitability of the proposed concept for application to real rocket engines.

AB Quiet auroral arcs formation has been investigated theoretically and numerically in a self-consistent dynamic way. By using a three-dimensional magneto-hydro-dynamics simulation of a dipole magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system, it is shown that multiple longitudinally striated structures of the ionospheric plasma density and the field-aligned current are formed, resulting from nonlinear feedback instability. The areas where these structures appear are consistent with the prediction by the integrated feedback theory that includes the effects of the spatially non-uniform electric field and non-uniform plasma density. Effects of the difference of the field line lengths between the ionosphere and the magnetospheric equator over the auroral latitudes are also discussed on the feedback instability.

AB The coupling effects among lateral mode, longitudinal mode and torsional mode of a launch vehicle cannot be taken into account in traditional dynamic analysis using lateral beam model and longitudinal spring-mass model individually. To deal with the problem, propellant analogy methods based on beam model are proposed and coupled mass-matrix of liquid propellant is constructed through additional mass in the present study. Then an integrated model of launch vehicle for free vibration analysis is established, by which research on the interactions between longitudinal and lateral modes, longitudinal and torsional modes of the launch vehicle can be implemented. Numerical examples for tandem tanks validate the present method and its necessity.

TI The propulsion system for the "Ludion" one-man hopper An Anglo-French
   rocket engine cooperation 40 years ago
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Rocket engine; Man-rated; History; Astronautics
AB The Ludion was a French concept for a military one-man rocket-powered "hopper" aimed at giving troopers the ability to cross rivers or trenches. Sud Aviation was awarded in 1965 the development contract together with Bertin (for the jet pumps) and SEPR was to develop the rocket propulsion system. The propulsion system selected for the "Ludion" was based on the British extensive experience in handling and using isopropyl nitrate as a way of obtaining large amounts of gas able to drive jet engines at start. The idea was to use such a fluid as monopropellant for the propulsion system's gas generator. SEPR integrated this system with pipes and Bertin ejector nozzles and developed a thermally insulated generator able to fulfil all requirements. The main challenges laid in the successful integration of all components and the management of a multi-partners programme and in the design of a highly efficient thermal insulation protecting both generator and pilot from the intense heat generated by the thermal decomposition of isopropyl nitrate (used as a propellant). The first ground test of a Ludion with its rocket propulsion system took place on January 24, 1968, on the test airfield of Villaroche. After 59 tethered and five free flights, the programme was abandoned. It was deemed to be too impractical due to its size, the noise generated and changes in tactical considerations in favour of helicopters and amphibious transports. The first prototype is now displayed at the Paris Le Bourget Air & Space Museum. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Estimation of the fluence of high-energy electron bursts produced by
   thunderclouds and the resulting radiation doses received in aircraft
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES

AB Using recent X-ray and gamma-ray observations of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) from spacecraft and of natural and rocket-triggered lightning from the ground, along with detailed models of energetic particle transport, we calculate the fluence (integrated flux) of high-energy (million electronvolt) electrons, X rays, and gamma rays likely to be produced inside or near thunderclouds in high electric field regions. We find that the X-ray/gamma-ray fluence predicted for lightning leaders propagating inside thunderclouds agrees well with the fluence calculated for TGFs, suggesting a possible link between these two phenomena. Furthermore, based on reasonable meteorological assumptions about the magnitude and extent of the electric fields, we estimate that the fluence of high-energy runaway electrons can reach biologically significant levels at aircraft altitudes. If an aircraft happened to be in or near the high-field region when either a lightning discharge or a TGF event is occurring, then the radiation dose received by passengers and crew members inside that aircraft could potentially approach 0.1 Sv (10 rem) in less than 1 ms. Considering that commercial aircraft are struck by lightning, on average, one to two times per year, the risk of such large radiation doses should be investigated further.

TI In-orbit performance of avalanche photodiode as radiation detector on

LA English
DT Article
ID X-RAYS; MISSION
AB The Cute-1.7+APD II, 10 x 15 x 20 cm(3) in size and 5 kg in mass, is the third picosatellite developed by students at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. One of the primary goals of the Cute-1.7+APD II mission is to validate the use of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) as a radiation detector for the first time in a space experiment. While the mission itself is immature compared to the forefront satellites of space plasma physics, use of APDs offers various possibilities regarding a brand-new electron energy analyzer for medium-energy electrons and ions (1-100 keV), as well as a high-performance light sensor for the future X-ray astronomy missions. The satellite was successfully launched by ISRO PSLV-C9 rocket on 28 April 2008 and has since been in operation for more than a year. The Cute-1.7+APD II carries two reverse-type APDs to monitor the distribution of low-energy particles (mainly electrons and protons) down to 9.2 keV trapped in a low Earth orbit (LEO), including the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) as well as aurora bands. We present the design parameters and various preflight tests of the APDs prior to launch, particularly, the high counting response and active gain control system for the Cute-1.7+APD II mission. Examples of electron/proton distribution, obtained in continuous 12 h observations, will be presented to demonstrate the initial flight performance of the APDs in orbit.

AB The fundamental relationship between entropy and aerospace vehicle and mission performance is analyzed in terms of the general availability rate balance between force-based vehicle performance, available energy associated with expended propellant, and the overall loss rate of availability, including the vehicle wake. The availability relationship for a vehicle is analytically combined with the vehicle equations of motion; this combination yields the balance between on-board energy rate usage and rates of changes in kinetic and potential energies of the vehicle and overall rate of entropy production. This result is then integrated over time for a general aerospace mission; as examples, simplified single-stage-to-orbit rocket-powered and air-breathing missions are analyzed. Examination of rate of availability loss for the general case of an accelerating, climbing aerospace vehicle provides a powerful loss superposition principle in terms of the separate evaluation and combination of loss rates for the same vehicle in cruise, acceleration, and climb. Rate of availability losses is also examined in terms of separable losses associated with the propulsion system and external aerodynamics. These loss terms are cast in terms of conventional parameters such as drag coefficient and engine specific impulse. Finally, rate losses in availability for classes of vehicles are described.

TI Control Effects of Baffle on Combustion Instability in a LOX/GH(2)

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
ID INJECTION
AB The combustion instability encountered unexpectedly in hot-firing tests of the YF-960 liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (LOX/GH(2)) rocket engine was numerically researched. Here, the emphasis was on evaluating the control effects of two kinds of baffle configurations on combustion instability. The integrated physical model and numerical method were presented to solve the turbulent, three-dimensional, two-phase, and full-size LOX/GH(2) rocket combustion process. The dominant oscillation frequency characteristics that appeared in the hot-firing tests were reproduced and confirmed first, which validated the computational fluid dynamics code to a certain extent. The baffle effects were investigated by the developed mass flow flux perturbing model. Results show that the control effect of the hub-and-six-blade baffle on the one-order tangential-mode oscillation frequency of 5800 Hz is better than that of the hub-and-three-blade baffle. Although the two kinds of baffles have similar effects on the radial-mode instability, the control effect is better for damping the 5800 Hz oscillation than the 2900 Hz oscillation. This research has provided direct design data for engineers, and it is valuable in further understanding the baffle-eliminating mechanisms.

AB This article proposes a multidisciplinary design and optimization (MDO) strategy for the conceptual design of a multistage ground-based interceptor (GBI) using hybrid optimization algorithm, which associates genetic algorithm (GA) as a global optimizer with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as a local optimizer. The interceptor is comprised of a three-stage solid propulsion system for an exoatmospheric boost phase intercept (BPI). The interceptor's duty is to deliver a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) to the optimal position in space to accomplish the mission of intercept. The modules for propulsion, aerodynamics, mass properties and flight dynamics are integrated to produce a high fidelity model of the entire vehicle. The propulsion module comprises of solid rocket motor (SRM) grain design, nozzle geometry design and performance prediction analysis. Internal ballistics and performance prediction parameters are calculated by using lumped parameter method. The design objective is to minimize the gross lift off mass (GLOM) of the interceptor under the mission constraints and performance objectives. The proposed design and optimization methodology provide designers with an efficient and powerful approach in computation during designing interceptor systems.

AB A simplified analytical modeling of single aluminum particle combustion was conducted. Ignition and quasi-steady combustion (QSC) were separately formulated and integrated. Both the heat transfer from the hot ambient gas and the enthalpy of heterogeneous surface reaction (HSR) served to cause the particle ignition. Conservation equations were solved for QSC parameters in conjunction with conserved scalar formulation and Shvab-Zeldovich function. Limit temperature postulate was formulated by a sink term pertinent to the dissociation of the aluminum oxide near the flame zone. Effective latent heat of vaporization was modified for the thermal radiation. Ignition and QSC of the aluminum particle were predicted and discussed with emphasis on the effect of the aluminum oxide and variable properties. The model was validated with the experiments regarding ignition delay time, burning rate, residue particle size, flame temperature, QSC duration, and stand-off distance of the envelop flame. Agreement was satisfactory and the prediction errors were limited within 10%.

AB The post-12-Ma volcanism at Yucca Mountain (YM), Nevada, a potential site for an underground geologic repository of high-level radioactive waste in the USA, is assumed to follow a Poisson process and is characterized by a sequence of empirical recurrence rate time series. The last ten time series are used as a prediction set to check the predictive ability of the candidate model produced by a training sample using autoregressive integrated moving average modeling techniques. The model is used to forecast future recurrence rates that, in turn, are used to develop a continuous mean function of the volcanic process, which is not only required to evaluate the probability of site disruption by volcanic activity but accommodates a long period of compliance. At the model validation stage, our candidate model forecasts a mean number of 6.196 eruptions for the prediction set which accounts for seven volcanic events of the 33 post-12-Ma eruptions at the YM site. For a full-scaled forecasting, our fitted model predicts a waning volcanism producing only 3.296 new eruptions in the next million years. We then present the site disruption probability as the chance that a new eruption will occur in the "hazard area" based on a model developed for licensing commercial space launch and reentry operations in the space transportation industry. The results of the site disruption probability and sensitivity analysis are summarized with a numerical table generated from a simple equation sufficient for practical use. We also produce three-dimensional plots to visualize the nonlinearity of the intensity function associated with the underlying model of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process and emphasize that the interpretation of site disruption probability should always be accompanied by a compliance period.

TI Lunette: A low-cost concept enabling multi-lander lunar science and
   exploration missions
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
DE Lunar lander; Secondary payload
AB The development of low cost missions for lunar exploration has emerged as a topic of increasing interest. Recently a study team from JPL was tasked to consider potential high-value lunar surface science and exploration missions that could be performed with small, low cost landed assets, with particular emphasis on missions that could be flown as secondary payloads on evolved expendable launch vehicle (EELV) launches. A mission concept and flight system design was developed in the course of this study that would deliver a network of up to six individual landers to a local lunar region, utilizing the full capabilities of the EELV secondary payload adapter (ESPA). The braking burn of the six landers would be performed by a single solid rocket motor integral with the ESPA ring, following which the landers would separate from the ESPA and perform final descent and precision landing using their own onboard propulsion systems. The six landers would initiate a one year mission, performing site survey and environmental science measurements including illumination, temperature, radiation, soil mechanics, and seismometry. Additional payload accommodation would be available on each lander to include unique experiments. The lander design was constrained to fit within the requirements for accommodation on the ESPA. These include a wet mass of no more than 180 kg, and dimensions that fit in an envelope of 61x71x96cm. The total landed mass of the conceptual spacecraft is similar to 140kg which would deliver a total of similar to 15 kg of payload mass to the lunar surface, per lander. In addition to the multi-lander ESPA-based design, a single lander flight system variant was developed that could enable globally distributed network science at very low cost. This paper discusses the mission concepts, flight system designs and numerous system engineering challenges that led to the development of this uniquely flexible and cost effective lunar mission concept.

AB Noctilucent clouds (NLC) in the polar summer mesopause region have been observed in Norway (69 degrees N, 16 degrees E) between 1998 and 2009 by 3-color lidar technique. Assuming a mono-modal Gaussian size distribution we deduce mean and width of the particle sizes throughout the clouds. We observe a quasi linear relationship between distribution width and mean of the particle size at the top of the clouds and a deviation from this behavior for particle sizes larger than 40 nm, most often in the lower part of the layer. The vertically integrated particle properties show that 65% of the data follows the linear relationship with a slope of 0.42 +/- 0.02 for mean particle sizes up to 40 nm. For the vertically resolved particle properties (Delta z = 0.15 km) the slope is comparable and about 0.39 +/- 0.03. For particles larger than 40 nm the distribution width becomes nearly independent of particle size and even decreases in the lower part of the layer. We compare our observations to microphysical modeling of noctilucent clouds and find that the distribution width depends on turbulence, the time that turbulence can act (cloud age), and the sampling volume/time (atmospheric variability). The model results nicely reproduce the measurements and show that the observed slope can be explained by eddy diffusion profiles as observed from rocket measurements.

AB Three environmental forensic methods were used as part of an integrated evaluation to determine the extent of dissolved perchlorate in groundwater originating from a former rocket propellant testing site in Southern California. The methods included the evaluation of groundwater modeling, subsurface environmental conditions, and isotopic fingerprinting. While these methods have been used independently in environmental forensics, this study is the first to document the combined use of the methods to evaluate the extent of dissolved perchlorate in groundwater. Taken together, the results of this study indicated that the perchlorate originating from a former rocket propellant testing site is under hydraulic control and that multiple sources of perchlorate exist within the same hydrogeologic basin.

AB The internal and external flowfield variation of a launch vehicle has been simulated in an e-Science environment. To analyze the igniting process of a solid-rocket propellant, a fluid-structure interaction code has been developed using an ALE (arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) kinematical description and a staggered fluid-structure interaction algorithm. Also, unsteady motion of a detached rocket booster has been predicted by using an external flow analysis with an aerodynamic-dynamic coupled solver. A Korean e-Science environment designed for aerospace engineering, e-AIRS [15], supplies a user-friendly interface for such individual work and it can advance to an integrated rocket simulation of internal combustion and external flow variation by controlling the execution and data flow of two flow solvers. As a consequence, e-Science facilitates multi-disciplinary collaborative research, and makes individual work more convenient.

DE Air-launching rocket; Sequential optimization; System trade study;
   Multi-disciplinary feasible
AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, a comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. For the selection of the best system alternative, a trade study for the first stage engine type and launching speeds is performed using a sequential optimization technique, confirming the feasibility of the baseline air-launching rocket. Then, a system design has been performed using the multi-disciplinary feasible (MDF) design optimization method. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis. configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of multi-disciplinary system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1244.9 kg, total length of 6.36 m, outer diameter of 0.60 m has been successfully designed to launch a satellite of 7.5 kg to the 700 km circular orbit.

AB The present paper deals with domino effect analysis for industrial facilities. Actually, an explosion or accident may generate various sets of projectiles. In their trajectory, they may impact other existing facilities, such as tanks under high-pressure or other strategic components or installations (headquarters, etc). If the impacted targets fail, this may give rise to other sets of projectiles and so on. These potential series of accidents are known as domino effect. A probabilistic approach is developed by the authors. The probability of domino effect occurrence requires three main steps:
   -Probabilistic modelling of the source term (first set of projectiles): probability of the first explosion occurrence and therefore number, masses, velocities, departure angles, geometrical shape and dimensions, constitutive materials properties are described with probabilistic distributions. -
   -Probabilistic modelling of the target term (first set of impacted targets): number of impacting projectiles, velocities, incidence angles and energy at impact, constitutive materials and the dimensions of the impacted targets, projectiles penetration depths into the targets are also described with probabilistic distributions.
   - Evaluation of the risks of second set of explosions that may take place in the impacted components.
   Simulations (3D) are done within this probabilistic framework:
   - For the probabilistic description of the source term, the authors have collected existing models from the literature.
   - The authors propose new models for the impact (probability of impact which depends on the trajectory and geometry of both the target and projectile: ellipses, cylinders and planar plates, in a first step) and the penetration depth when there is impact. A simplified mechanical model is actually developed in the case of cylindrical rods impacting rectangular plates, both are metal made. The estimated penetration depth into the target is compared to the experimental data (4 data sets) collected from the literature with the following features: projectile masses ranging from 0.1 g up to 250 kg, projectile velocities ranging from 10 m/s up to 2100 m/s, projectile diameters ranging from 1.5 mm up to 90 mm, target strengths ranging from 300 MPa up to 1400 MPa and incidence angles ranging from 0 degrees up to 70 degrees.
   Monte-Carlo simulations are ran in order to calculate the different probabilities: probability of impact, distribution of the penetration depth and probability of domino effect. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The design of the CAPE I satellite was underway for approximately three years. This interdisciplinary project incorporates electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineering, as well as computer science and physics. The project hoped to teach students how to design, develop, and maintain a lower Earth orbiting satellite. This satellite was delivered to San Luis Obispo, California, December 5, 2006, where it passed the final integration test in order to qualify for launch. After qualification, the satellite was loaded into the poly-picosatellite orbital deployer or P-POD, which is the deployment system for the satellite. The P-POD holds three CubeSats. Once all three satellites were integrated, it was delivered to Kazakhstan and loaded into the DNEPR Russian Rocket on March 17, 2007. After a few delays, the rocket was launched on April 17,2007. The team is currently monitoring and decoding the CW beacons transmitted by the satellite.
   The project was broken into several subsystems including mechanical, communications, control and data handling, and power. Each of the systems proved to have their own unique challenges. Being that the majority of the team was electrical engineering students, the mechanical subsystem presented the most difficulty.
   There is currently a design in progress for the next satellite project, CAPE II. This new satellite will attempt a new benchmark by incorporating more advanced technologies than CAPE I and include other campus entities such as The Wetlands Research Center. The team hopes to deploy buoys into the Gulf of Mexico that will communicate to the CAPE II satellite in space and then send data to the ground station at the University. This data will include subjects such as coastal erosion, water temperatures, and drift currents throughout the Gulf. With this data, we can give other organizations the information obtained for their use as well.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center's E-3 test facility.

ID RADIATIVE HEAT-TRANSFER
AB Investigation of the infrared characteristics of a rocket nozzle is very important for the study of infrared initiating technology. The Narrow-Band Zone model is developed for that purpose. The spectral transmission and absorption factors are introduced, and the equations between radiative heat flux and the temperature of wall surfaces and gas are developed. The radiative heat transfer in one axisymmetric cylindrical enclosure filled with homogeneous radiative participating medium is computed with the Narrow-Band Zone model and compared with those in the reference documents. The comparison shows good agreement. The radiative heat transfer to the nozzle of one rocket engine is also calculated with the Narrow-Band Zone model, and the outgoing radiative energy flux and energy rate integrated in a mid-wave infrared band 2 similar to 6 mu m, a long-wave infrared band 8 similar to 14 mu m and the full wave band are analyzed. The following conclusions can be derived: the spectral radiation from the inlet and outlet of the nozzle show apparent spectral discontinuity, which appears greater in the 2.7 similar to 2.95 mu m than in the neighboring wave band. The spectral outgoing radiative energy flux of nozzle wall is similar to that of gray body, which decreases with wavelength in 2 similar to 14 mu m. The outgoing radiative energy flux on the nozzle wall is greater in the cylindrical and contracting section of nozzle, but smaller in the divergent section, which is determined by temperature. The nozzle of the rocket engine radiates most energy in the mid-wave surfaces by absorption. The most important feature of gas radiation is the strong selection of the waveband, so the detailed study of the infrared characteristics of nozzle of the rocket engine should be carried out on narrow-band computation.

AB An asymptotic technique is integrated with computational solution development to describe the generation and evolution of intense unsteady vorticity and the accompanying temperature response in a model of solid rocket motor (SRM) chamber with low Mach number, weakly viscous internal flow. The chamber considered here has a rectangular cross-section, has to equally permeable walls, closed at the head end, and is opened at the downstream end. An initially steady internal flow from steady sidewall injection is generated. Then an additional transient sidewall mass injection with different wave numbers at non-resonance and resonance frequencies is imposed on the generated steady one. This mechanism is used to simulate the transient propellant combustion occurring on the sidewall in a real SRM chamber. The analytical approach is based on the reduced form of the Navier-Stokes using asymptotic technique. The results show that unexpectedly large transient shear stresses and temperature gradients are created at the sidewall of the chamber at resonance frequencies and low wave numbers. A comparison between the analytical, computational and experimental results is performed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study the detectability and characterization of electron beams as they leave their acceleration site in the low corona toward interplanetary space through their nonthermal X-ray bremsstrahlung emission. We demonstrate that the largest interplanetary electron beams (greater than or similar to 10(35) electrons above 10 keV) can be detected in X-rays with current and future instrumentation, such as RHESSI or the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Hinode. We make a list of optimal observing conditions and beam characteristics. Amongst others, good imaging (as opposed to mere localization or detection in spatially integrated data) is required for proper characterization, putting the requirement on the number of escaping electrons (above 10 keV) to greater than or similar to 3 x 10(36) for RHESSI, greater than or similar to 3 x 10(35) for Hinode/XRT, and greater than or similar to 10(33) electrons for the FOXSI sounding rocket scheduled to fly in 2011. Moreover, we have found that simple modeling hints at the possibility that coronal soft X-ray jets could be the result of local heating by propagating electron beams.

AB A rapid pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of one flavonoid (panasenoside), nine saponins (ginsenoside Rg1, Re, Rf, Rg2, Rb1, Rc, Rb2, Rb3 and Rd) and two polyacetylenes (panaxydol and panaxynol) in Folium Ginseng and Radix Ginseng was developed. A Prevail C(18) rocket column (33 mm x 7 mm, 3.0 mu m) and gradient elution were used during the analysis. Flavonoid was quantified at 355 nm, and saponins and polyacetylenes were determined at 203 nm. The chromatographic peaks of 12 investigated compounds in samples were unambiguously identified by compared their UV spectra and/or MS data with the related reference compounds. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r > 0.999) within the test ranges. The intra- and inter-day variations for 12 analytes were less than 1.17% and 2.17%, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the investigated compounds in 10 samples of Radix Ginseng and Folium Ginseng, respectively. The result showed that PLE combined with rocket column HPLC analysis could provide a rapid method for analysis of compounds in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), which is helpful to comprehensive evaluation of quality of Radix Ginseng and Folium Ginseng.

TI Rocket-based measurements of ion velocity, neutral wind, and electric

AB The JOULE-II sounding rocket salvo was launched from Poker Flat Rocket Range into weak pulsating aurora following a moderate substorm at 0345 LT on 19 January 2007. We present in situ measurements of ion flow velocity and electric and magnetic fields combined with neutral wind observations derived from ground observations of in situ chemical tracers. Measured ion drifts in the 150-198 km and 92-105 km altitude ranges are consistent with (E) over right arrow X (B) over right arrow motion to within 16 m s(-1) rms and with neutral wind velocity to within 20 m s(-1), respectively. From these measurements we have calculated the ratio kappa of the ion cyclotron and ion collision frequencies, finding kappa = 1 at an altitude of 118 +/- 0.3 km. Using direct measurements of ion current, we calculate the Joule heating rate and Pedersen and Hall conductivity profiles for this moderately active event and find height-integrated values of 390 W km(-2) and 0.59 and 2.22 S, respectively. We also find that these values would have errors of up to tens of percent without coincident neutral wind measurements, and presumably more so during more active conditions. Ion flow vectors were measured at a rate of 125 s(-1); however, no significant fluctuations were observed at spatial/temporal scales below similar to 350 m and 0.5 s. Observational limits were 5.5 m and 0.016 s.

AB A set of equations of motion is derived for an aircraft undergoing aerial refueling. The equations include the time-varying mass and inertia associated with fuel transfer as well as the vortex-induced wind effect from the tanker. They are derived in terms of the translational and rotational position and velocity of the receiver with respect to the tanker. The equations of motion are implemented in an integrated simulation environment with a feedback controller for receiver station keeping as well as a feedback controller to fly the tanker on a U-turn maneuver.

TI Film Cooling of Accelerated Flow in a Subscale Combustion Chamber
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID PROPELLANT ROCKET ENGINES; HISTORY
AB Experimental investigations have been carried out to examine film cooling effectiveness of an accelerated hot gas In a subscale rocket combustion chamber. In support or future first-stage high-performance rocket combustion chambers, a Vulcain-2-like test case has been examined with combustion pressure levels tip to 12 MPa. The effectiveness of an almost tangentially injected film of hydrogen with an initial temperature of approximate to 280 K has been determined. Axial distributions of temperature were measured Inside the copper liner as well as on the chamber surface in the convergent and divergent parts of the nozzle segment. An existing film cooling model has been modified for application fit it combined convective and film-cooled combustion chamber with an accelerated hot gas. The new model predicts film cooling effectiveness at different combustion-chamber pressures Had film blowing rates at sub-, trans-, and supersonic conditions.

AB The initial discharge stages of two flashes during the Shandong Artificially Triggering Lightning Experiment (SHATLE) are analyzed based on the synchronous data of the current and close electromagnetic field. For a lightning flash, named 0503, the wire was connected, not electrically, but via a 5 m length of nylon, with the lightning rod; while for another, named 0602, the wire was connected with the rod directly. Results show that the discharge processes of the initial stage (IS) in flash 0503 are quite different from that of the usual classical-triggered flash 0602 and altitude-triggered flashes. A large pulse with a current of about 720 A resulted from the breakdown of the 5 m air gap during flash 0503, and the corresponding electric field at 60 m from the lightning rod was 038 kV/m. The upward positive leaders (UPLs) propagated continuously from the tip of the rocket after this breakdown. The geometric mean (GM) of the UPL peak current was 23.0 A. Vaporization of the wire occurred during the initial continuous current (ICC) stage and the largest current pulse was about 400 A. Compared with triggered flash 0503, the discharge processes of IS in flash 0602 were simple, only two large pulses similar to each other occurred before dart leader/return stroke sequences. The peak current of the first pulse was 2.1 kA and its corresponding electric field and magnetic field at a distance of 60 m from the lightning rod were 0.98 kV/m and 7.03 mu T, respectively. During the second pulse, the wire disintegrated. The current decreased to the background level at the moment of the wire disintegration. The current of the second pulse in triggered flash 0602 was 2.8 kA, and the corresponding electric field and magnetic field at 60 m from the lightning rod were 1.22 kV/m and 9.01 mu T, respectively.

AB This presents the capabilities of two English Electric Aviation Canberra aircraft owned by High Altitude Mapping Missions, Inc. These aircraft are available for high altitude commercial, government, and scientific missions. The basic specifications of the Canberra are provided and compared to other high-performance jet aircraft falling into the same category. This describes the high altitude flight characteristics and mission capabilities of the Canberras. The aircraft are configured to conduct up to eight-hour flight operations with up to six hours at 50,000 feet altitude. Shorter missions can be conducted at higher altitudes. Potential missions include: IFSAR, magnetic field mapping, gravity field mapping, imaging (SAR, IR, & hyper-spectral), LIDAR, communications relay, dropsonde deployment, hybrid rocket launching, severe storm monitoring, and disaster monitoring. Canberra high altitude operations have minimal weather impact on missions, are free from flight constraints imposed by air traffic control, can do large area coverage, and long mission times.

AB The loss of the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 was caused by the impact of foam insulation on the leading edge of the wing. The foam strike created a hole in reinforced carbon-carbon panel 8 that led to excessive heating during re-entry, loss of the integrity of the left wing, and subsequent loss of the vehicle and crew. In the 2.5 years following the accident, there was a concerted effort to understand the impact threat to the space shuttle system. The effort was a large one, and was comprised of five integrated parts: (1) identifying the debris that can be shed by the External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters: (2) determining the impact speeds and angles that debris can strike the Orbiter: (3) quantifying the amount of damage to the thermal protection system Caused by those strikes: (4) estimating the temperature rise in the damaged regions during re-entry; and (5) deciding whether the temperature rise is Sufficient to affect Structural integrity. Each of these parts was addressed through experimentation and the development of what are called within the space shuttle program Critical Math Models. These models are extensively verified and validated to give high confidence in their results and are baselined by the shuttle program. This paper overviews the extensive experimental and modeling efforts of the return-to-flight program, emphasizing the impact testing and modeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new quasi-one-dimensional procedure (one-dimensional with area change) is presented for the transient solution of real-fluid flows in lines and volumes including heat transfer effects. The solver will be integrated into a larger suite of software modules developed for simulating rocket engines and propulsion systems. The solution procedure is coupled with a state-of-the-art real-fluid property database so that both compressible and incompressible fluids may be considered using the same procedure. The numerical techniques used in this procedure are described. Test cases modeling transient flow of nitrogen, water, and hydrogen are presented to demonstrate the capability of the current technique.

AB Compared with steam catapult system, electromagnetic launcher (EML) system is highly integrated, and it has high and well matching performance. It will be widely used aircraft carriers ejection, rocket launchers etc in future. Double-side tabular permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) for electromagnetic launcher can meet the requirements of big thrust and high efficiency etc. It can accelerate the launcher at the expected speed in short time. The thrust characteristic of the launcher is essential to the whole electromagnetic launcher system. Large thrust and small thrust ripple are both expected. This paper studies thrust characteristic of different pole arc coefficients, compares the series and parallel magnetic circuit structures, and analyses the method of staggering a certain distance between poles on both sides. In order to achieve the goal of large thrust, the Launcher is often designed with high current density. As a result, it is of great loss and has quick temperature rise. This paper establishes numerical model of the two-dimensional (2D) primary transient temperature field. The temperature field of the short-term system is analyzed. The calculated and experimental results of the electromagnetic launchers can provide a basis for optimum design.

TI Trajectory Analysis for Vertical Takeoff and Vertical Landing Reusable
   Launch Vehicle's Upper Stage
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English

ID ASCENT GUIDANCE; ENTRY GUIDANCE; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN
AB Reusable launch vehicles are a promising business for the future because of their flexibility, reliability, low cost, and good operability. There are two takeoff styles: the vertical takeoff and the horizontal takeoff. Compared to the horizontal takeoff vehicle, the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle has advantages, such as a shorter down-range landing, a quicker recovery system (wherein takeoff and landing happen in approximately the same location), and a lighter weight. A vertical profile is used for vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles to achieve a recovery at the launch site. However, the first stage of the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle (RLV) typically can provide a very small or even zero velocity to its second or upper stage, if the upper stage is released at the peak altitude. Therefore, primarily, this type of launch vehicle is used to achieve hundreds of seconds in a microgravity environment. The upper stage payload delivery capabilities of a vertical takeoff RLV and its potential applications are described from a trajectory point of view. A modified optimal control methodology and an intuitive method of the trajectory control, called energy for altitude and time, are used to determine the maximum throw distance, maximum flight time, and orbital insertion capabilities for certain payloads, separately. The results from this investigation show the possibilities of expanding the applications for the VTVL suborbital RLV.

ID HIGH-TEMPERATURES; WATER VAPOR; TUNGSTEN; OXIDATION; KINETICS; STEAM
AB An integrated theoretical/numerical framework is established and validated to study the chemical erosion of refractory-metal (tungsten, rhenium, and molybdenum) nozzle inserts in solid-rocket-motor environments, with a primary focus on tungsten. The formulation takes into account multicomponent thermofluid dynamics in the gas phase, heterogeneous reactions at the surface, energy transport in the solid phase, and nozzle material properties. Typical combustion species of nonmetallized ammonium-perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated-polybutadiene propellants at practical motor operating conditions are considered. The erosion rates calculated by employing three different sets of chemical kinetics data available in the literature for the tungsten-steam reaction have been compared. The effect of considering either of two different tungsten oxides, WO(2) or WO(3), as the final product of surface reactions is also investigated. The predicted erosion rates compare well with experimental data. The oxidizing species of H(2)O proved more detrimental than CO(2) in dictating the tungsten nozzle erosion. The material recession rate is controlled by heterogeneous chemical kinetics because the diffusion limit is not reached. The erosion rate increases with increasing chamber pressure, mainly due to higher convective heat transfer and enhanced heterogeneous surface reactions. The tungsten nozzle erodes much more slowly than graphite, but at a rate comparable with that of rhenium. The molybdenum nozzle-exhibits the least erosion for flame temperatures lower than 2860 K. Its low melting temperature (2896 K), however, restricts applications for propellants with high flame temperatures.

AB Scramjet engines promise significantly higher specific impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase if low-Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difficulty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system Includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 6-12 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled final-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled In deliver approximately 100 log to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5 % with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efficient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most significant improvement to their use for space access.

AB The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is the fifth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. The mission employs five identical micro-probes (termed "probes"), which have orbit periods of one, two and four days. Each of the Probes carries five instruments to measure electric and magnetic fields as well as ions and electrons. Each probe weighs 134 kg including 49 kg of hydrazine fuel and measures approximately 0.8x0.8x1.0 meters (LxWxH) and operates on an average power budget of 40 watts. For launch, the Probes were integrated to a Probe Carrier and separated via a launch vehicle provided pyrotechnic signal. Attitude data are obtained from a sun sensor, inertial reference unit and the instrument Fluxgate Magnetometer. Orbit and attitude control use a RCS system having two radial and two axial thrusters for roll and thrust maneuvers. Its two fuel tanks and pressurant system yield 960 meters/sec of delta-V, sufficient to allow Probe replacement strategies. Command and telemetry communications use an S-band 5 watt transponder through a cylindrical omni antenna with a toroidal gain pattern. This paper provides the key requirements of the probe, an overview of the probe design and how they were integrated and tested. It includes considerations and lessons learned from the experience of building NASA's largest constellation.

DE C/C composites; solid rocket motor; HfC; ablation performance
AB The carbon felt reinforced HfC-C/C and C/C composite integrated throats were prepared by thermal gradient chemical vapour infiltration process, and their ablation resistance was determined by using an equipment of solid rocket motor under the pressure of 7MPa. The effects of carbon hafnium on ablative properties of the integrated throat were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The results show that the ablation behavior of the HfC-C/C composite integrated throat has characteristic of a steady ablation stage with constant linear ablation rate. Compared with those measured for the C/C composite integrated throat, the linear and mass ablation rates of the HfC-C/C composite integrated throat are decreased by 34% and 13% respectively.

TI Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbit Communication Satellite Deliveries with
   Integrated Electric Propulsion
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID MISSIONS
AB The use of electric propulsion was evaluated for transfer of communication satellites from geosynchronous transfer orbits to geosynchronous earth orbits. Recent communication satellite designs, normal launch vehicle delivery orbits, and integrated electric propulsion subsystems (with input powers less than nominal satellite power levels) were assumed to minimize required changes to present and near-term launchers and spacecraft. The capture fraction of recent communication satellites that could have been delivered was evaluated versus launcher delivery capability, launch site, and in-space propulsion characteristics. Electric propulsion significantly increases the capture fraction of launchers with geosynchronous transfer mass delivery capabilities less than (dependent on launch site) about 4500 to 5500 kg. Insertion times at given launch sites were found to be accurately specified by the satellite power-to-mass ratios and the assumed electric propulsion specific-impulse/efficiency characteristics. Insertion times less than 100 days were found for satellites with high power-to-mass ratios that used high thrust-to-power electric propulsion options. The influence of power for electric propulsion beyond that used for satellite payloads and housekeeping was also assessed, and insertion times less than a month will require powers significantly higher than presently installed.

ID NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS; LINE RELAXATION; VISCOSITY
AB As part of a two-phase experimental study to obtain detailed heating and pressure data over the full-scale hypersonic international flight research and experimentation (HIFiRE-1, formally FRESH FX-1) flight geometry, Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center has completed a matrix of ground tests to determine the optimal flight geometry and instrumentation configuration necessary to make measurements of desired flow phenomena during the flight experiment. The primary objective of the HIFiRE-1 flight experiment is to collect high-quality flight data from integrated flight instrumentation to be used for computational fluid dynamic code and ground test facility validation in regions of boundary-layer transition, turbulent separated flow, and shock/boundary-layer interaction. To support this flight experiment, data have been obtained in the large energy national shock hypervelocity wind tunnel employing a full-scale model over a range of Mach numbers from 6.5 to 7.4 and Reynolds numbers from 0.5E + 06 to 5.5E + 6 duplicating the reentry trajectory. These points gave researchers the best chance to measure the transition process on the forecone and have a turbulent separated flow on the cylinder that reattached onto the flare section. These test condition ranges were determined directly from the nominal descent trajectory of the Australian-launched Terrier-Orion launch vehicle that will serve as the booster for HIFiRE-1. The entire experimental database will be compared to future flight data and used by computationalists to validate codes in regions of attached and separated laminar and turbulent flows with shock/boundary layer interaction. In addition to the experimental data, Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center performed a large amount of computational fluid dynamic analyses to confirm and validate not only the tunnel How conditions, but also the two- and three-dimensional flows over the model itself. These detailed computational results will be presented in a Part 2 companion paper.

AB This paper describes an effort to optimize the design of an entire space launch vehicle to low Earth (circular) orbit, consisting of multiple stages using a genetic algorithm with the goal of minimizing vehicle weight and ultimately vehicle cost. The entire launch vehicle system is analyzed using various multistage configurations to reach low Earth orbit. Specifically, three- and four-stage solid propellant vehicles have been analyzed. The vehicle performance modeling requires that analysis from four separate disciplines be integrated into the design optimization process. The disciplines of propulsion characteristics, aerodynamics, mass properties, and flight dynamics have been integrated to produce a high-fidelity system model of the entire vehicle. In addition, the system model has been validated using the existing launch vehicle data. The cost model is mass based and uses extensive historical data to produce a cost estimating relationship for a solid propellant vehicle. For the design optimization, the goal is for the genetic algorithm to minimize the differences between the desired and actual orbital parameters. This ensures that the payload achieves the desired orbit. One final goal is to minimize the overall vehicle mass, thus minimizing the system cost per launch. This paper will represent the first effort of its kind to minimize the solid propellant launch vehicle cost at the preliminary design level using a genetic algorithm.

ID EQUATIONS; MODEL
AB The numerical simulation of cavitating flows in turbomachinery is studied at the Turbomachinery and Cavitation team of Laboratoire des Ecoulements Geophysiques et Industriels (LEGI), Grenoble, France in collaboration with the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, CNES), the rocket engine division of Snecma and Numeca International. A barotropic state law is proposed to model the cavitation phenomenon and this model has been integrated in the CFD code FINE/TURBO (TM). An analysis methodology allowing the numerical simulation of the head drop induced by the development of cavitation in cold water was proposed and applied in the case of two four-bladed inducers and one centrifugal pump. Global results were compared to available experimental results. Internal flows in turbomachinery were investigated in depth. Numerical simulations enabled the characterization of the mechanisms leading to the head drop and the visualization of the effects of the development of cavitation on internal flows.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID OPTIMIZATION; COMBUSTION
AB A nested direct/indirect method is used to find the optimal design for a microgravity platform which is based on a hybrid sounding rocket. The direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with the indirect trajectory optimization to maximize a given mission performance index. A gas-pressure feed system is used, with three different propellant combinations. The feed system exploits a pressurizing gas, namely, helium, when hydrogen peroxide or liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant propellant tank pressure. Only self-pressurization is considered with nitrous oxide; two different models are used to describe the behavior of the tank pressurization. The simplest model assumes liquid/vapor equilibrium. A two-phase model is also proposed: Saturated vapor and superheated liquid are considered and the liquid/vapor mass transfer evaluation is based on the liquid spinodal line. Results show that the different tank-pressurization models yield minimal differences of the optimal motor characteristics. Performance differs slightly due to the different mass of the residual oxidizer. The propellant comparison for the present case shows better performance for hydrogen peroxide/ polyethylene with respect to liquid oxygen/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, while nitrous oxide/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene remains attractive for system simplicity and low costs.

AB Following the completion of NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study in August 2004 for the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), the Ares Projects Office at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was assigned project management responsibilities for the design and development of the first vehicle in the architecture, the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), which will be used to launch astronauts to low earth orbit and rendezvous with either the International Space Station or the ESMD's earth departure stage for lunar or other future missions beyond low Earth orbit. The primary elements of the Ares I CLV project are the first stage, the upper stage, the upper stage engine, and vehicle integration. Within vehicle integration is an effort in integrated design and analysis which is comprised of a number of technical disciplines needed to support vehicle design and development. One of the important disciplines throughout the life of the project is aerodynamics. This paper will present the status, plans, and initial results of Ares I CLV aerodynamics as the project was preparing for the Ares I CLV Systems Requirements Review. Following a discussion of the specific interactions with other technical panels and a status of the current activities, the plans for aerodynamic support of the Ares I CLV until the initial crewed flights will be presented.

AB Soil in laboratory microcosm experiments was amended with dried and milled crop residues of onion (Allium cepa L. cv. Mission) or garlic (A. sativa L. cv. California Early). The amendments, along with the additional factors of amendment concentration (0, 1 or 3% (w/w)) and soil temperature (23 or 39 degrees C), were evaluated with respect to germination of seeds of the weedy annual plants Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. (barnyard grass), Portulaca oleracea L. (common purslane), Sisymbrium irio L. (London rocket) and Solanum nigrum L. (black nightshade). Deleterious effects of seed exposure to 39 degrees C versus 23 degrees C were demonstrated in ECHCG, POROL, and SSYIR; and to increasing amendment concentration and the [concentration x temperature] interaction in all four plant species tested (P < 0.05). The effect of garlic versus onion amendment was significant only in SOLNI, where garlic residues demonstrated more herbistatic and/or herbicidal activity. The results of these experiments showed that the garlic and onion plant residues were capable of causing significant reductions in seed germination during their decomposition in soil, but only at elevated (39 degrees C versus 23 degrees C) soil temperature. At the agricultural level, activity of these residues could be exploited as a component of integrated weed management using appropriate crop sequencing, and may extend utility of soil heating treatments (e.g. solarization) for weed control to cooler climates or seasons, or for shorter treatment durations.

TI Flow choking by drag and combustion in supersonic engine-testing
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Breakdown of diffuser flow in the engine wind tunnel has often been observed during scramjet engine tests conducted in the Ramjet Engine Test Facility in Japan. The unstable and precipitant nature of the breakdown phenomena may result in serious damage to the engine wind tunnel and should therefore be prevented. A one-dimensional analysis was applied to the diffuser flow to identify the causes of the How breakdown. All the losses and gains by the engine were represented by point sources of mass, momentum, and energy. The duct friction term was integrated along the diffuser, assuming that the normal shock was located at the exit of the duct. The thermal choking condition was calculated by incorporating results of a chemical equilibrium numerical code. The fuel rates causing the flow choking were successfully reproduced and matched with the limit of fuel rates observed in our tests. Inlet unstart of the engine caused the loss of the ejector-pumping effect in the diffuser system, which triggered flow choking. Choking was also promoted by the drag of the gas sampling rakes. The choking in diffuser flow and the engine unstart may be coupled, resulting in hysteresis in the diffuser breakdown, which was also experienced in our tests. As the rocket-based, combined-cycle engine is scheduled to be tested under the Mach 4 condition in 2007, the safety of the experiment is now a primary issue. The current analysis showed that the new engine would easily cause choking of diffuser because of the larger propellant supply rates and the relatively low specific impulse. Reasonable operation of the wind tunnel to control the flow choking in future tests was examined.

AB The introduction of inorganic nanomaterials as additives into polymer systems has resulted in polymer nanostructured materials exhibiting a multiplicity of high-performance characteristics beyond what traditional polymer composites possess. These multifunctional features attributable to polymer nanocomposites consist of improved thermal and flame resistance, moisture and chemical resistance, decreased permeability, charge dissipation, and thermal/electricity conductivity. Through control/alteration of the additive at the nanoscale level, one is able to maximize property enhancement of selected polymer systems to meet or exceed the requirements of current commercial, military, and aerospace applications. The technical approach involves the introduction of nanoparticles into selected polymer matrix systems whereby nanoparticles may be surface-treated to provide hydrophobic characteristics and enhanced inclusion into the hydrophobic polymer matrix. The objectives of this paper are to summarize our current research efforts in the use of polymer nanostructured materials for high-temperature applications such as rocket nozzle ablative materials, resulting in lower ablation rates and reduced backside temperatures, carbon-carbon composites with improved thermo-oxidative resistance, and enhanced damage-tolerant high-performance epoxy matrix resin, but not carried over to carbon-fiber-reinforced composite systems.

AB Changes in the levels of gluconasturtiin (2-phenylethyl glucosinolate), an aromatic glucosinolate, was used to evaluate the response of 'Green Rocket' Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris ssp. pekinensis L.) to the feeding of three and five cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni Hubner) larvae per plant. Plants were harvested 0, 10, and 17 days after infestation. The change in gluconasturtiin concentration resulting from decreased light capture from diminished leaf area was also studied. All samples were assayed for gluconasturtiin concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. The gluconasturtiin concentration of plants subjected to five larvae per plant showed a 59% increase 10 days after infestation compared with noninfested plants. Difference in gluconasturtiin concentration between three and five larvae per plant was nonsignificant. Seventeen days after initial infestation and 7 days after larvae were removed (final harvest), gluconasturtiin concentration did not decrease compared with the previous harvest. Reduced light or leaf area removal did not significantly affect gluconasturtiin concentration.

AB Worldwide ground observations of upper atmospheric airglow with particular emphasis on the OI 557.7 and 630 nm emissions have been conducted since 1960s. This study reports the first ground observations of OI 557.7 nm green line emission over the Taiwan area. For comparison, the background continuum at 530 nm was also measured by the same system. The experiments were conducted during the period of Aug - Dec, 2004 at various locations in Taiwan using a self-developed photometer instrument. Daily height integrated intensity of the night-time green line emission may vary in the range of 80 - 210 Rayleighs and twilight enhancement is also identified. The observational results may serve as a useful reference for follow-up sounding rocket measurements of OI 557.7 nm airglow emission over the Taiwan area.

AB The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft was designed and constructed to withstand the harsh environments associated with achieving and operating in Mercury orbit. The system can be divided into eight subsystems: structures and mechanisms (e.g., the composite core structure, aluminum launch vehicle adapter, and deployables), propulsion (e.g., the state-of-the-art titanium fuel tanks, thruster modules, and associated plumbing), thermal (e.g., the ceramic-cloth sunshade, heaters, and radiators), power (e.g., solar arrays, battery, and controlling electronics), avionics (e.g., the processors, solid-state recorder, and data handling electronics), software (e.g., processor-supported code that performs commanding, data handling, and spacecraft control), guidance and control (e.g., attitude sensors including star cameras and Sun sensors integrated with controllers including reaction wheels), radio frequency telecommunications (e.g., the spacecraft antenna suites and supporting electronics), and payload (e.g., the science instruments and supporting processors). This system architecture went through an extensive (nearly four-year) development and testing effort that provided the team with confidence that all mission goals will be achieved.

TI Solid rocket motor internal ballistics simulation using
   three-dimensional grain burnback
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID EROSIVE BURNING MODEL; COMBUSTION; ROBILLARD; LENOIR
AB Internal ballistics simulations of solid rocket motors have been conducted with the propellant grain's 3-D burning surface geometry described by a new minimum distance function approach and the internal flowfield represented by 1-D, time-dependent, single-phase compressible flow equations. The combustion model includes erosive burning and unsteady, dynamic burning corresponding to transient energy storage in the heated surface layer of the propellant. The integrated internal ballistics code (Roeballist) is used to investigate the role of these two burning rate augmenting mechanisms in solid rocket motor performance. Two tactical motors are used as test cases. Results indicate that dynamic burning can be the dominant factor in producing a short-duration ignition pressure spike in low-L* motors, particularly if the L/D ratio is not too large and the port cro ss section is nonrestrictive (e.g., center perforated grain). However, when L/D is large and the port cross section is noncircular in the aft section (aft fins/slots), erosive burning can take over in dominating the burning rate to the extent that an otherwise progressive pressure-time trace becomes regressive/neutral. That is, erosive burning can effectively prolong the initial pressure spike in some star-aft motors. The results also show that with sufficiently accurate models of dynamic burning and erosive burning, it is reasonable to expect reliable internal ballistics predictions with suitable simplified flowfield models, thereby realizing significant reductions in computation time compared with 3-D, multiphase reacting flow simulations.

AB "Rocket" is a collective name used to term some species within the Eruca and Diplotaxis genera, whose leaves are characterized by a more or less pungent taste. Different approaches have been carried out to differentiate both genera that have similar leaf morphologies. Following our research in flavonoid profiling of the Brassicaceae family using high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet-diode array detection/electrospray ionization mass spectroemtry, we have investigated Eruca vesicaria and Diplotaxis tenuifolia leaf samples as new ingredients of fresh salads. The MS/MS study allowed the identification of new naturally occurring quercetin mono- and diacyl-tri-O-glucosides and the elucidation of the flavonoid glycosylation and acylation patterns. Important differences between flavonoid profiles of E. vesicaria and D. tenuifolia were observed. E. vesicaria contained kaempferol derivatives as principal compounds whereas D. tenuifolia instead accumulated quercetin derivatives. The exhaustive study of the profiling of these species could help further studies concerning the bioavailability of these flavonoids for epidemiological or clinical intervention studies because these species have considerable potential as healthy leafy salads because of the bioactive phytochemicals.

AB A method for the implementation of integrated three-degree-of-freedom constrained entry guidance for reusable launch vehicle is presented. Given any feasible entry conditions, terminal area energy management interface conditions, and the reference trajectory generated onboard then, the method can generate a longitudinal guidance profile rapidly, featuring linear quadratic regular method and a proportional-integral-derivative tracking law with time-varying gains, which satisfies all the entry corridor constraints and meets the requirements with high precision. Afterwards, by utilizing special features of crossrange parameter, establishing bank-reversal corridor, and determining bank-reversals according to dynamically adjusted method, the algorithm enables the lateral entry guidance system to fly a wide range of missions and provides reliable and good performance in the presence of significant aerodynamic modeling uncertainty. Fast trajectory guidance profiles and simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various missions and aerodynamic uncertainties are presented to demonstrate the capacity and reliability of this method.

AB The paper discusses results obtained with a finite-volume code that simulates viscous, turbulent flows for. 3-D, adaptive, unstructured meshes. The implementation uses a cell-centered, face-based data structure. A fully explicit, second-order accurate, five-stage, Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme is used to perform the time marching of the flow equations.. Spatial discretization of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations can be performed with second-order centered or upwind schemes. Automatic grid refinement routines are considered to adapt the original mesh. A sensor based on density gradients selects the volumes to be refined. The code is able to handle tetrahedra, hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids. A full multigrid scheme is available to accelerate convergence to steady state. Coarse grid levels are.constructed through an agglomeration procedure. One- and two-equation turbulence models are implemented to include the turbulent effects into the numerical formulation. The mentioned.features integrated in one single code allow the Brazilian aerospace program to simulate complex flow conditions for sounding rockets and satellite launch vehicles with accuracy and reasonable computational resources. Good agreement with theoretical or experimental results is obtained with the present numerical tool.

AB Multidisciplinary design optimization is an important approach for the conceptual design of space planes because these planes are characterized by disciplines that interact with one another. A multidisciplinary design optimization problem of a single-stage-to-orbit space,plane is formulated and solved in this study. The modeling and optimization of rigid body characteristics, such as trim and stability, are focused on because a single-stage-to-orbit space plane has a tendency for considerable shift of both the aerodynamic center and the center of gravity. Moreover, the design of the air'-breathing engines are integrated with the airframe and its effect on the rigid body characteristics are also modeled in the framework of multidisciplinary design optimization. Using the all-at-once-based multidisciplinary design optimization approach, which incorporates sparse nonlinear programming and metamodeling, the design of the vehicle and its flight trajectory are successfully optimized. Finally, the characteristics of the optimal solution are investigated, especially the relationships among the airframe-engine integration, rigid body characteristics, and payload transportation capability.

AB Gas leakage through a damaged network in composite laminates is experimentally evaluated to assess fuel leakage in relation to the applicability of high-performance composites to cryogenic propellant tanks of space launch vehicles. Using [0(2)/theta(2)](S) (theta = 45, 60, 75 and 90) laminates, matrix cracks in 0 degrees plies are induced by three-point flexural loading and subsequent uniaxial tensile tests of laminates in 0 degrees direction to produce matrix cracks in all constituent plies of the laminates. Helium gas leak rates through the damaged laminates subjected to uniaxial loadings are measured using a helium leak gas detector at room temperature. The effect of intersecting angles of matrix cracks on gas leakage is discussed using the simple leak model based on leak conductance at intersections of matrix cracks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A general zero-dimensional modelling of implosion without thermonuclear reactions is presented, for standard indirectly driven capsules. It is not substantially a new theory, but new demonstrations and improvements of existing models. The model is derived directly from the gas dynamics conservation equations written in integral form for fluid domains with variable mass, in effect the whole non-ablated capsule, the hot spot and the dense shell. The necessary approximations which involve global or mean quantities are justifed theoretically and checked by comparisons with numerical simulations. Two different sets of approximations are developed, one for each of the acceleration and the deceleration phases of the implosion. An improved-in the sense that the time variation of the hohlraum temperature is fully taken into account as it is required for high gain capsules-rocket model is proposed for the acceleration phase. With further approximations, it gives the maximum implosion velocity and the initial capsule mass corresponding to a given final capsule mass, in terms of the initial outer deuterium-tritium radius and the maximum hohlraum temperature. For the deceleration phase, the present model gives an analytical solution for the time decrease in the implosion velocity up to stagnation. Assuming the invariance of PV gamma for the different media considered-a property only approximately verified-this model defines the state of these mediums in deceleration and at stagnation, in terms of the mean entropy parameters, the capsule mass, the mean implosion velocity at the end of acceleration and the initial gas mass filling the shell. A simple ODE, which can be easily integrated numerically, is derived for the hot spot mass which depends on the heat conduction wave ablating the fuel from the inside. All the numerical coefficients presently involved in the model can be calculated from the EOS, opacities and heat conduction parameters, except for the value of the supplementary energy transferred to the non-ablated capsule during deceleration which has been taken here, for simplicity, from simulations. Results obtained with this modelling are shown to be in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations for several different capsules.

DE space tourism; reusable launch vehicle; parametric cost modelling
AB In comparison with other large scale Space projects, "Space Tourism" requires only one development - a suitable, economic, Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). The high flight rates associated with "tourism" are expected to make RLV operations more economically attractive. However, currently projected RLV launch prices appear well above those affordable by tourists. A study of the economics of Space Tourism has been made using an Integrated Parametric System Model to assess potential future RLV performance and costs. The estimated costs per passenger for "first generation" RLVs are still above estimates for an acceptable market price per ticket, but are not an order of magnitude different. Technology improvements, particularly engine technology, can be expected to make reductions in the ticket cost. Repayment of non-recurring (development) costs can form up to 50% of the costs per flight, but an initial market might be started using "second hand" vehicles developed for other purposes. Finally, the slow but steady growth of "real income" over an extended period can be expected to make what are now unaffordable prices for a ride into orbit more affordable in 20 - 30 years time.

AB The space propulsion industry and, indeed, the overall space transportation industry in the United States have been in decline since the first human landing on the moon in 1969. The hoped-for reversal to this decline through the space shuttle and space station programs never really materialized. From an 80% market share in the late 1970s, the U.S. share of the world launch market fell to similar to 20% by 2002. During that period, only two new booster engines have been developed and flight certified in this country. Only limited progress has been made in reducing engine costs or increasing performance although these factors are not necessarily directly related. Upper-stage and in-space propulsion in the United States have not fared much better in the world market. On the other hand, space-faring nations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the former Soviet Union are believed to have developed 40-50 new, high-performance engines over the same period. This trend will have to be reversed to enable future exploration missions. The intent of this paper is to summarize past propulsion-system development, assess the,current status of U.S. space propulsion, survey future options, evaluate potential impact of ultra low-cost, small launch-vehicle programs, and discuss some future propulsion needs for space exploration.

AB Three multilevel multidisciplinary optimization techniques, Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, Collaborative Optimization, and Modified Collaborative Optimization, are applied to the design of a reusable launch vehicle, evaluated, and compared in this study. In addition to comparing the techniques against each other, they are also compared with designs reached via fixed-point iteration of disciplines with local optimization and the industry accepted multidisciplinary optimization technique, All-at-Once. The new multidisciplinary optimization techniques, particularly Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, showed greater ability than fixed-point iteration to design for a global objective and were more applicable to complex systems than All-at-Once. This study was the first time that the novel multidisciplinary optimization methods were compared qualitatively and quantitatively under controlled experimentation practices. It is still impossible to statistically determine whether any one of the novel multidisciplinary optimization techniques is better than another, because more studies using different test problems corroborating the conclusions made here are needed.

AB In November 1994 and August 1997 the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (CRISTA) instrument performed a global measurement (72 degrees S-72 degrees N) of infrared limb radiance from 4 to 71 mu m in the altitude range 6-180 km. Using a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) model that couples the collisional, radiative and photochemical processes, the kinetic temperature was recovered from 15 mu m CO2 emission for CRISTA-1 and -2 missions by direct assimilation of the integrated limb radiances between 72 and 120 km. Falling sphere and airglow validation measurements at NASA/GSFC Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and the Mesosphere-Thermosphere Emissions for Ozone Remote Sensing (METEORS) experiment at White Sands Missile Range were coordinated with CRISTA during the field campaign. The derived temperatures show good agreement with these rocket soundings, partial climatology obtained from Rayleigh scattering observations by Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and NRLMSISE-00 model.

AB The overall sizing of launch vehicles is of interest, especially when air-breathing is also included. The sizing of a launch vehicle is dictated by the State of Art technologies present and the need to match the challenging demands of high-payload fraction, low cost, and also ensure reliability. This paper presents some of the important design requirements. An ideal velocity approach, which assumes various velocity losses, is generally followed for initial vehicle sizing. However, as this approach is approximate and sometimes incorrect, a new concept of accounting the drag and thrust losses during the atmospheric phase for conventional rockets and air-breathing launch vehicles using scramjet propulsion is evolved complementing the ideal velocity sizing approach. A simplistic two-dimensional trajectory simulation program with graphics for quick interactive design was developed for this purpose. The air-breathing launch vehicle trajectory is split into three flight phases. The sizing of the vehicle considering, especially, the intermediate air-breathing regime is also dealt with. A method to determine the maximum-load envelope expressed in terms of the product of flight dynamic pressure and angle of attack, namely Q-alpha, for all weather launches useful for initial design purposes is also suggested. The design program meant for initial design sizing purposes gives a quick insight on the vehicle performance prior to detailed design with minimum basic vehicle data for conventional rockets and also for air-breathing scramjet vehicles. The various design factors, such as optimum velocity requirement for two stage to orbit vehicles and the sizing requirement of the orbital stage after end of air-breathing phase, are also discussed through representative typical values highlighting the design sensitivities.

AB This work details the derivation of the energy normalization function which arises in motor stability calculations. It starts by identifying the flow parameters that appear in Kirchoff's expression defining the acoustic energy density in a given enclosure. Special care is taken to account for the rotational contributions due to unsteady chamber vorticity. Subsequently, these flow parameters are inserted into the energy normalization function and perturbed to the leading order. The resulting expressions are simplified and asymptotically integrated to obtain the average value of the energy normalization function. This procedure is repeated for two basic geometries pertaining to the circular-port and slab rocket motors, respectively. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of unsteady rotational flow components is critically important for the accurate assessment of energy. We also find that the conventional one-dimensional approach is lacking because it omits unsteady rotational contributions. It under-predicts the energy normalization function by 25% in each of the circular and slab motor cases. (C) 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring the structural integrity of filament wound composite structures such as solid rocket motor cases and liquid fuel bottles can help prevent catastrophic failures and prolong their service life. An integrated structural health monitoring system has been developed by Acellent as a non-destructive evaluation tool for detecting hidden damage in filament wound composite structures. The system includes a built-in sensor network, supporting diagnostic hardware and data processing/analysis software. A prototype of a filament wound composite bottle with embedded SMART Layers has been fabricated successfully at NASA Marshall Space and Flight Center. This demonstrated the compatibility of the SMART Layer to filament winding process. Impact tests were performed on the prototype bottle to generate damage. A scan of the entire bottle by the distributed network of sensors using Acellent's diagnostic system was able to locate the damage. The built-in signal processing and imaging techniques employed by the software demonstrated the ability of the software to display the impact damage with relative ease in the face of temperature change.

AB Optimization of a spacecraft's interplanetary trajectory and electric propulsion system remains a complex and difficult problem. Simultaneously solving for the optimal trajectory, power level, and exhaust velocity can be difficult and time consuming. If the power system's technology level is unknown, multiple optimizations must be conducted to map out the trade space. Trajectories with constant-power, solar-power, variable-specific-impulse, and constant-specific-impulse low-thrust propulsion systems are analyzed and optimized. The technological variables, power system specific mass, propellant tank coefficient, structural coefficient, and the launch vehicle are integrated into the cost function allowing for maximization of the payload mass fraction. A classical solution is reviewed that allows trade studies to be conducted for constant-power, variable exhaust velocity systems. The analysis is expanded to include bounded-power constant specific impulse systems and solar electric propulsion spacecraft with constant and variable exhaust velocity engines. The cost function and mass fractions are dimensionless to allow for scaling of the spacecraft systems.

AB Using a multiple linear regression analysis of nearly six years of WINDII records, an empirical formula is determined to predict the altitude of the peak of the OH nightglow emission. More than 50,000 altitude profiles of volume emission rate collected by WINDII for the OH (8-3) band P-1(3) line emission during November 1991 to August 1997 over latitudes 40 degrees S - 40 degrees N are used. The peak altitudes of these profiles increase with decreasing integrated emission rates and are almost completely described by the integrated emission rates. However the fitting is improved when a solar cycle dependence is considered. A slight further improvement results from incorporating a sinusoidal annual/semi-annual component for data from the mid-latitude region. With this formula, more than 87% of the calculated peak altitudes lie within a 1 km difference of the measured values for the mid-latitude region.

AB A conceptual design study was performed to assess and compare the parameters of two-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch-vehicle systems in an effort to identify optimal configurations for improved access to space. The following vehicle configuration categories were considered: horizontal takeoff ramjet-scramjet boosters with upper-stage reusable rockets, horizontal takeoff turbine boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages, and vertical takeoff rocket boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages. Ramjet-scramjet upper stages utilize integrated rockets for final orbital ascent. Ramjet-scramjet booster stages make use of either integrated turbines or rockets for takeoff and acceleration to ramjet start. The payload requirement for each vehicle system is 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile low Earth orbit. The vehicle solutions were-evaluated utilizing several figures of merit including empty weight, wetted area, actively cooled area, gross weight, staging considerations, and design and technology traceability to future development of single-stage-to-orbit hypersonic airbreathing vehicles. The application of these criteria to the closed vehicle solutions reveals that the vertically launched rocket booster with an upper-stage ramjet-scramjet is the best two-stage airbreathing launch vehicle configuration. Of all of the two-stage vehicles investigated, those which place the hypersonic propulsion elements as part of the upper stage surpass those with first-stage placement and exhibit more design traceability with single-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch vehicles.

AB This article deals with the application of OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) to the study of high-pressure cryogenic flames (p = 6.3 MPa). It is shown that this optical diagnostic provides good-quality data and can be used to examine the flame structure in the injector near-field. High-pressure conditions require a careful choice of excitation wavelength based on a detailed analysis of the absorption coefficient dependence on pressure and temperature. It is particularly important to consider line-broadening and central-frequency-shifting effects induced by high-pressure operation. PLIF is used to examine jet flames formed by a single coaxial injector fed by liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen (LOx/GH(2)) in subcritical and transcritical regimes. In the latter case, the liquid oxygen temperature is below its critical value while its pressure is above critical (T-LOx = 85 K < TC (02) = 150 K, PLO, = 6.3 MPa > Pc(02) = 5.04 MPa). Such transcritical conditions prevail in many high-performance devices such as liquid-propellant rocket engines. A detailed understanding of this type of combustion is necessary to the development of improved and more reliable propulsion systems. PLIF provides images that may be considered to represent instantaneous distributions of OH radicals and may be used to infer the structure and position of the flame. An optical multichannel analyzer is also used in the experiments to ensure that the detected signals have the expected spectral features. Fluorescence spectra are also compared with emission spectra synthesized with Lifbase in terms of line positions and broadening. Mean flame positions deduced from PLIF images are shown to nearly match those deduced from the Abel transformed average OH* light-emission distributions. The difference is related to a biased estimate of the flame position resulting from the Abel transformed emission data. PLIF is also used to examine the flame edge. It is known from a previous analysis of the flame-holding mechanism that the low-speed wake established just behind the oxygen injector lip and generated by the two propellants must be thicker than the flame-edge thickness to ensure stable anchoring. PLIF images indicate that the flame thickness is on the order of the wake transverse size. When the thickness exceeds this transverse dimension it is found that the flame becomes sensitive to the high-speed hydrogen stream. Finally, the instantaneous PLIF images of OH included in this article may serve as a guide to current efforts directed at the large-eddy simulation of transcritical combustion.

AB Multiphysics simulations are playing an increasingly important role in computational science and engineering for applications ranging from aircraft design to medical treatments. These simulations require integration of techniques and tools from multiple disciplines, and in turn demand new advanced technologies to integrate independently developed physics solvers effectively. In this paper, we describe some numerical, geometrical, and system software components required by such integration, with a concrete case study of detailed, three-dimensional, parallel rocket simulations involving system-level interactions among fluid, solid, and combustion, as well as subsystem-level interactions. We package these components into a software framework that provides common-refinement based methods for transferring data between potentially non-matching meshes, novel and robust face-offsetting methods for tracking Lagrangian surface meshes, as well as integrated support for parallel mesh optimization, remeshing, algebraic manipulations, performance monitoring, and high-level data management and I/O. From these general, reusable framework components we construct domain-specific building blocks to facilitate integration of parallel, multiphysics simulations from high-level specifications that are easy to read and can also be visualized graphically. These reusable building blocks are integrated with independently developed physics codes to perform various multiphysics simulations.

AB This paper investigates the postbuckling behavior of a simple beam under an intermediate follower force acting in the tangential direction to the centroidal axis of the beam. One end of the beam is pinned, while the other end is attached to a roller support. Two approaches have been used in this study. The first approach is based on the elastica theory. The governing equations are derived and solved analytically for the exact closed form solutions that include the equilibrium configurations of the beam, equilibrium paths, and bending moment distribution of the beam. The exact solutions take the form of elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds. In the second approach, the shooting method is employed to solve a set of nonlinear differential equations with the boundary and intermediate conditions. The equations are integrated by using the Runge-Kutta algorithm. The error norms of the end and intermediate conditions are minimized to within a prescribed tolerance error. A comparison study between the analytical elliptic integral solutions and the numerical shooting method solutions show excellent agreement of results. Special features of the solutions are also highlighted.

AB The trend of miniaturization has been applied to the research of rockets to develop prototypes of micro rockets. In this paper, the development of a web-integrated prototyping system for three-dimensional micro rockets, and the results of combustion tests are discussed. The body of rocket was made of 6061 aluminum cylinder by lathe process. The three-dimensional micro nozzles were fabricated oil the same aluminum by using micro endmills with phi 100 mu m similar to phi 500 mu m diameter. Two types of micro nozzle were fabricated and compared for performance. The total mass of the rockets was 7.32 g and that of propellant (gun powder) was 0.65 g. The thrust-to-weight ratio was between 1.58 and 1.74, and the flight test with 45 degree launch angle from the ground resulted in 46 m similar to 53 in of horizontal flight distance. In addition, ABS housing for the micro machined rocket was fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). A web-based design, fabrication, and test system for micro nozzles was proposed to integrate the distributed hardware resources. Test data was sent to the designer via the same web server for the faster feedback to the rocket designer.

AB The direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has recently been developed to simulate homogeneous condensation in a free-expansion rocket plume. However, cluster-monomer and cluster-cluster collision models as well as the determination of cluster size were simplified in the previous work, and the effect on the accuracy of the numerical simulation results was not quantified. In this work, the molecular-dynamics (MD) method is used to simulate collision and sticking probabilities for argon clusters and the results are compared with the hard-sphere model. These improved models are then integrated into a DSMC code to predict the Rayleigh scattering intensity in a free-expanding argon condensation plume, and numerical results are compared with experimental data along the plume centerline.

TI Adaptive Helmholtz resonators and passive vibration absorbers for
   cylinder interior noise control
SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an adaptive-passive solution to control the broadband sound transmission into rocket payload fairings. The treatment is composed of passive distributed vibration absorbers (DVAs) and adaptive Helmholtz resonators (HR). Both the frequency domain and time-domain model of a simply supported cylinder excited by an external plane wave are developed. To tune vibration absorbers to tonal excitation, a tuning strategy, based on the phase information between the velocity of the absorber mass and the velocity of the host structure is used here in a new fashion to tune resonators to peaks in the broadband acoustic spectrum of a cavity. This tuning law, called the dot-product method, only uses two microphone signals local to each HR, which allows the adaptive Helmholtz resonator (AHR) to be manufactured as an autonomous device with power supply, sensor, actuator and controller integrated. Numerical simulations corresponding to a 2.8 m long 2.5 m diameter composite cylinder prototype demonstrate that, as long as the structure modes, which strongly couple to the acoustic cavity, are damped with a DVA treatment, the dot-product method tune multiple HRs to a near-optimal solution over a broad frequency range (40-160 Hz). An adaptive HR prototype with variable opening is built and characterized. Experiments conducted on the cylinder prototype with eight AHRs demonstrate the ability of resonators adapted with the dot-product method to converge to near-optimal noise attenuation in a frequency band including multiple resonances.

AB Amorphous boron powder of high purity (92-94%) with a particle size of 1-2 mm is preferred as a fuel for fuel-rich propellants for integrated rocket ramjets and for igniter formulations. This paper describes the studies on process optimisation of two processes, ie, oxidative roasting of boron (roasting boron in air) and roasting boron with zinc in an inert medium for preparing high purity boron. Experimental studies reveal that roasting boron with zinc at optimised process conditions yields boron of purity more than 93 per cent, whereas oxidative roasting method yields boron of purity similar to 92 per cent. Oxidative roasting has comparative edge over the other processes owing to its ease of scale-Lip and simplicity

AB A particle simulation method to model wafer condensation process in a supersonic rocket plume is proposed. and developed. Classic nucleation theory is used to predict nucleation, condensation, and the evaporation 'rates for water clusters. Microscopic kinetic models are developed to simulate collision processes between water clusters and monomers, between water clusters and foreign molecules, and evaporation 4 monomers from water clusters. These models are-integrated into the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to simulate an axisymmetric multispecies gas expansion coupled with condensation. The developed computational scheme, first verified by empirical scaling jaws of condensation in supersonic microjets is then applied to predict the spatial distributions of water cluster number density, size, and temperature in a rocket exhaust plume. An empirical equation is used to correct classical, nucleation rate, condensation results are compared between the, original and corrected nucleation rite, and the impact of the nucleation rate on a flow with condensation is discussed in detail.

AB Based on requirements for a next-generation rocket test facility, elements of a prototype intelligent rocket test facility (IRTF) have been implemented. The preliminary results provide the basis for future advanced development and validation using rocket test stand facilities at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Key components include distributed smart sensor elements integrated using a knowledge-driven environment. One of the specific goals is to imbue sensors with the intelligence needed to perform self-diagnosis of health and to participate in a hierarchy of health determination at sensor, process, and system levels. We have identified issues important to further development of health-enabled networks, which should be of interest to others working with smart sensors and intelligent health management systems.

AB For technological reasons many high-performance solid rocket motors are made from segmented propellant grains with non-uniform port geometry. In this paper parametric studies have been carded out to examine the geometric dependence of transient flow features in solid rockets with non-uniform ports. Numerical computations have been carded out in an inert simulator of solid propellant rocket motor with the aid of a standard k-omega turbulence model. It was seen that the damping of the temperature fluctuation is faster in solid rocket with convergent port than with divergent port geometry. We inferred that the damping of the flow fluctuations using the port geometry is a meaningful objective for the suppression and control of the instability and/or pressure/thrust oscillations during the starting transient of solid rockets.

AB A new subgrid-scale turbulence model involving all the transport equations of the subgrid-scale stresses and including a dissipation rate equation is proposed for large-eddy simulation (LES) of unsteady flows which present nonequilibrium turbulence spectra. Such a situation in flow physics occurs when unsteadiness is created by forced boundary conditions, but also in more complex situations, when natural unsteadiness develops due to the existence of organized eddies. This latter phenomenon explains the instability found in a porous-walled chamber with mass injection. Due to the high value of Reynolds number, the presence of wall boundaries, and the use of relatively coarse grids, the spectral cutoff may be located before the inertial zone of the energy spectrum. The use of transport equations for all the subgrid-scale stress components allows us to take into account more precisely the turbulent processes of production, transfer, pressure redistribution effects, and dissipation, and the concept of turbulent viscosity is no longer necessary. Moreover, some backscatter effects can possibly arise. As a result of modeling in the spectral space, a formally continuous derivation of the model is obtained when the cutoff location is varied, which guaranties compatibility with the two extreme limits that are the full statistical Reynolds stress transport model of Launder and Shima and direct numerical simulation. In the present approach, due to the presence of the subgrid-scale pressure-strain correlation term in the stress equations, the new subgrid model is able to account for history and nonlocal effects of the turbulence interactions, and also to describe more accurately the anisotropy of the turbulence field. The present model is first calibrated on the well-known fully turbulent channel flow. For this test case, the LES simulation reveals that the computed velocities and Reynolds stresses agree very well with the DNS data. The application to the channel flow with wall mass injection which undergoes a transition process from laminar to turbulent regime and the development of natural unsteadiness is then considered for illustrating the potentials of the method. LES results are compared with experimental data including the velocity components, the turbulent stresses, and the transition location. A satisfactory agreement is obtained for both the mean quantities and the turbulent field. In addition, structural information of the flow is provided. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.

AB A totally new ignition scheme is proposed, in which the compressed DT main fuel is ignited by impact collision of another fraction of separately imploded DT fuel, which is accelerated in the hollow conical target to hyper-velocities in the order of 10(8) cm/s. Its kinetic energy is directly converted into thermal energy corresponding to temperatures > 5 keV on the collision with the main fuel, and this self-heated portion plays the role of ignitor. The ignitor shell is irradiated typically by nsec-pulses at intensities > 10(15) W/cm(2) and laser wavelength of 0.35 mu m to exert ablation pressures > 100 Mbar. A preliminary two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation shows substantial heating of the compressed core. The impact-shell acceleration and consequent working windows for the beam and target parameters are addressed based on a rocket model. Simple physics, high-energy coupling efficiency, low cost, not needing a PW laser, and affordability of investigation in laboratories under rather well-established physical understanding and experimental know-how are considered to be the notable advantages of the present scheme.

AB The mission of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes to enable improved prediction of climate. weather. and natural hazards for present and future generations. The ESE has an end-to-end strategy to assure that information. understanding. and capabilities derived from its research program achieve maximum usefulness to the scientific and decision-making communities. Small satellites (< 500 kg) have been crucial contributors to satisfying the research strategy since the inception of NASA's Earth observation program in the 1960s. In the last decade, NASA's ESE has placed a renewed emphasis on small satellites. This reemphasis reflects advancements in compact sensor, small satellite bus. and launch vehicle technologies in addition to management innovations. Near term and advanced planning suggest that this trend will continue. A number of related small satellite missions have been recently launched, are in development. or are planned. Multi-satellite constellations under study include small satellites as key architectural elements. Studies indicate that low cost. capable microspacecraft along with compact sensors and increased autonomy are technology enablers to the sensorwebs and associated distributed spacecraft infrastructure required to realize the long-term NASA Earth Science Vision (ESV).

TI Dual-band infrared imagery of an atlas 5 launch vehicle in flight
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Imagery acquired with a quantum-well infrared photodetector dual-band infrared focal plane array of the inaugural launch of the Atlas 5 launch vehicle is presented. The focal plane array was developed under the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Advanced Sensors Federated Laboratory program and used a read-out integrated circuit produced under the Air Force Research Laboratory's Advanced Multi-Quantum Well Technology program. The detectors are able to sense light in both the 3-5- and 8-12-mum atmospheric transmission windows such that the resulting single-band images are pixel registered and simultaneous. The focal plane array was installed in a camera system that used a closed-cycle cooler to operate at 60 K. The camera was placed at the prime focus of an all-reflective telescope on a computer-controlled tracking mount at the Innovative Sensor Technology Evaluation Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. The launch was observed from a distance of 15 kin from the pad. The dual-band camera system was calibrated using standard blackbody sources. The launch vehicle was observed from about 30 s after launch until approximately 4 min after launch. This corresponded to ranges between 15 km and more than 300 km and altitudes from just over 1 km to more than 100 km. Several interesting differences in the structure of the plume were observed. In addition, the hardbody of the rocket was seen in the 8-12-mum imagery but was undetectable in the 3-5-mum imagery. The imagery was unsaturated in both bands allowing us to obtain good measurements of the radiance of the plume in both the principal infrared bands.

AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. Given mission objective is to launch 7.5kg nano-satellite to the target orbit of 700km x 700kni using the mother plane, F-4E Phantom. The launching altitude and velocity are 12km, Mach number 1.5, respectively. As the propulsion system, a hybrid rocket engine is used for the first stage, and the solid rocket motors are used for the second and third stages. The total mass, length and diameter constraints of the rocket are imposed by the mother plane. The system design has been performed using the sequential optimization method. Gradient based SQP(Sequential Quadratic Programming) algorithm is employed. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis, configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1272.61kg, total length of 6.43m, outer diameter of 0.60 m and the payload mass of 7.5kg has been successfully designed.

TI Optimising expansion deflection nozzles for vacuum thrust

ID ROCKET NOZZLES; BASE-PRESSURE; FLOW; FLOWFIELD
AB While expansion deflection (ED) nozzles have traditionally been considered primarily for use as altitude compensating devices to improve the performance of single stage to orbit vehicles, they also offer the potential for enhancing high altitude propulsion systems. If intended to only operate in near vacuum conditions, the complexity of analysis and inherent risks involved in the ED concept are greatly reduced. An integrated approach to the design and performance analysis of such nozzles is presented, comprising a mixture of computational fluid dynamics, the method of characteristics, and a semi-empirical model to allow full analysis of the closed wake flow-field of an ED nozzle. While it is demonstrated that the influence of the parameters used to define the throat region is critical to the successful application of the ED nozzle, it is also shown that with careful design the weight savings possible are significant. The analysis method itself is flexible and rapid, and lends itself well to incremental improvements in accuracy as the flow under consideration becomes better understood.

AB The European Agency under its Aurora programme is about to undertake bold and unprecedented steps towards exploring the outer planets of our solar system. A very important step in this programme is a Mars sample return mission lead by the European Space Agency. One main point in this mission is transporting samples from mars with and without humans back to Earth. Transporting these samples and humans from the hostile Mars environment to low Mars orbit and then back to Earth will require some means of transportation based on rockets. In this respect the Surrey Space Centre is exploring alternatives to design a low cost, modular Planetary Ascent Vehicle (PAV). This paper will briefly describe the following:
   Sizing and systems design of a Mars Ascent Vehicle
   Issues on the design of the Navigation, Guidance and Control System of a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV).

AB [1] Two rockets were flown through noctilucent clouds (NLC) during the Distribution and Role of Particles in the Polar Summer Mesosphere using Coordinated Rocket, Radar, and Lidar Techniques (DROPPS) rocket experiment from Andoya Rocket Range, Norway, in July 1999. Each rocket was equipped with three-axis, double-double, high-impedance Langmuir probes ( 12 probes each flight) and produced unprecedented resolution of the electric potential distribution around the rockets in and near both a weak NLC ( DROPPS1) and a very strong NLC (DROPPS2). Detailed analysis of the vehicle interaction during the weak NLC encounter, in which no large geophysical electric fields were detected [ Holzworth et al., 2001], provided a basis for understanding the strong NLC encounter by DROPPS2, where geophysical electric fields reached 3 V m(-1). The electric field orientation is shown to be vertically downward. In the case of the strong NLC encounter a layer of excess positive charge at the top of the layer reached a density of 2 pC m(-3), deduced from the sharp field gradient. The total integrated potential drop through the NLC was 2 kV.

AB Hot section components in high-performance aircraft and rocket engines are increasingly being made of single crystal nickel superalloys such as PWA1480, PWA1484, CMSX-4, and Rene N-4 as these materials provide superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance, and thermomechanical fatigue capabilities over their polycrystalline counterparts. Fatigue-failures in PWA1480 single crystal nickel-base superalloy turbine blades used in the space shuttle main engine fuel turbopump are discussed. During testing many turbine blades experienced stage II noncrystallographic fatigue cracks with multiple origins at the core leading edge radius and extending down the airfoil span along the core surface. The longer cracks transitioned from stage II fatigue to crystallographic stage I fatigue propagation, on octahedral planes. An investigation of crack depths on the population of blades as a function of secondary crystallographic orientation (beta) revealed that for beta=45 +/- 15 deg tip cracks arrested after some growth or did not initiate at all. Finite element analysis of stress response at the blade tip, as a function of primary and secondary crystal orientation, revealed that there are preferential beta orientations for which crack growth is minimized at the blade tip. To assess blade fatigue life and durability extensive testing of uniaxial single crystal specimens with different orientations has been tested over a wide temperature range in air and hydrogen. A detailed analysis of the experimentally determined low cycle fatigue properties for PWA1480 and SC 7-14-6 single crystal materials as a function of specimen crystallographic orientation is presented at high temperature (75degreesF-1800degreesF) in high-pressure hydrogen and air Fatigue failure parameters are investigated for low cycle fatigue data of single crystal material based on the shear stress amplitudes on the 24 octahedral and 6 cube slip systems for FCC single crystals. The max shear stress amplitude [Deltatau(max)] on the slip planes reduces the scatter in the low cycle fatigue data and is found to be a good fatigue damage parameter, especially at elevated temperatures. The parameter Delta tau(max) did not characterize the room temperature low cycle fatigue data in high-pressure hydrogen well because of the noncrystallographic eutectic failure mechanism activated by hydrogen at room temperature. Fatigue life equations are developed for various temperature ranges and environmental conditions based on power-law curve fits of the failure parameter with low cycle fatigue test data. These curve fits can be used for assessing blade fatigue life.

AB The development and verification of a dedicated global positioning system (GPS) sensor for sounding rocket missions is described. It is based on the hardware design of a terrestrial low-cost, single-frequency coarse/acquisition (C/A) code receiver but operates an enhanced software that has been specifically adapted for high dynamics applications. Besides the navigation and timing function provided by traditional GPS receivers, the prediction of the instantaneous impact point (IIP) has for the first time been integrated into the receiver software. Making use of a newly developed perturbed-parabolic trajectory model, the receiver can directly perform real-time IIP predictions with an accuracy that is compatible with operational ground software and is only limited by atmospheric forces. It is expected that the availability of onboard IIP prediction will both simplify existing range safety systems and contribute to a future increase of the onboard autonomy of sounding rocket missions. The overall receiver performance is demonstrated with hardware-in-the-loop simulations and actual flight data for representative mission profiles.

AB The ability to model and analyze system performance is a key enabler when you are extending the operational life of complex systems. This is especially true when the system is operating in a hostile environment, such as space. This paper discusses a change made to the Space Shuttle main engines (SSMES) that affected the solid rocket booster (SRB) performance, and illustrates how databases maintained by the different subsystem contractors can be integrated, correlated, and evaluated to improve a subsystem component performance model. The enhanced model can be used not only for better prediction of component performance on the existing system, but can be used on upgrades to the system, or the next generation space shuttle solid rocket motor.

SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY

DT Article
DE Blattella germanica; IPM; public housing
ID INNER-CITY CHILDREN; ORTHOPTERA; INFESTATIONS
AB The long-term costs and efficacy of two treatment methodologies for German cockroach. Blattella germanica (L.). control were compared in the public housing environment. The "traditional" treatment for German cockroaches consisted of monthly baseboard and crack and crevice treatment (TBCC) by using spray and dust formulation insecticides. The integrated pest management treatment (IPM) involved initial vacuuming of apartments followed by monthly or quarterly applications of baits and insect growth regulator (IGR) devices. Cockroach populations in the IPM treatment were also monitored with sticky traps. Technician time and the amount of product applied were used to measure cost in both treatments. Twenty-four hour sticky trap catch was used as all indicator of treatment efficacy. The cost of the IPM treatment was found to be significantly greater than the traditional treatment, particularly at the initiation of the test. In the first month (clean-out), the average cost per apartment unit was $14.60, whereas the average cost of a TBCC unit was $2.75. In the second month of treatment, the average cost of IPM was still significantly greater than the TBCC cost. However, after month 4 the cost of the two treatments was no longer significantly different because many of the IPM apartments were moved to a quarterly treatment schedule. To evaluate the long-term costs of the two treatments over the entire year, technician time and product quantities were averaged over all units treated within the 12-mo test period (total 600 U per treatment). The average per unit cost of the IPM treatment was ($4.06). The average IPM cost was significantly greater than that of the TBCC treatment at $1.50 per unit. Although the TBCC was significantly less expensive than the IPM treatment, it was also less effective. Trap catch data indicated that the TBCC treatment had little. if any;. effect oil the cockroach populations over the course of the year. Cockroach populations in the TBCC treatment remained steady for the first 5 mo of the test and then had a threefold increase during the summer. Cockroach populations in the IPM treatment were significantly reduced from all averaue of 24.7 cockroaches per unit before treatment to all average 3.9 cockroaches per unit in month 4. The suppressed cockroach populations (<5 per unit) in the IPM treatment remained constant for the remaining 8 mo of the test.

TI Autonomous safety and reliability features of the K-1 avionics system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Kistler Aerospace Corporation is developing the K-1, a fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Both stages return to the launch site using parachutes and airbags. Initial flight operations will occur from Woomera, Australia. K-I guidance is performed autonomously. Each stage of the K-I employs a triplex, fault tolerant avionics architecture, including three fault tolerant computers and three radiation hardened Embedded GPS/INS units with a hardware voter. The K-1 has an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system on each stage residing in the three vehicle computers based on similar systems in commercial aircraft. During first-stage ascent, the IVHM system performs an Instantaneous Impact Prediction (IIP) calculation 25 times per second, initiating an abort in the event the vehicle is outside a predetermined safety corridor for at least 3 consecutive calculations. In this event, commands are issued to terminate thrust, separate the stages, dump all propellant in the first-stage, and initiate a normal landing sequence. The second-stage flight computer calculates its ability to reach orbit along its state vector, initiating an abort sequence similar to the first stage if it cannot. On a nominal mission, following separation, the second-stage also performs calculations to assure its impact point is within a safety corridor.
   The K-1's guidance and control design is being tested through simulation with hardware-in-the-loop at Draper Laboratory. Kistler's verification strategy assures reliable and safe operation of the K-1. (C) 2003 Kistler Aerospace Corporation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Achieving the ultimate goal of an economically viable reusable launch vehicle will eventually require developing Federal Aviation Regulation-type performance-based requirements and certification by the Federal Aviation Administration, as is currently done for commercial transports. Because the necessary requirements do not currently exist, there is no verifiable and traceable link between thermal protection system design implementation and resulting performance, safety, and cost. An initial attempt has been made to outline a set of performance-based thermal protection system design requirements. Critical requirements that will have a profound effect on the economic viability of a reusable launch vehicle, such as those for ground hail strike, lightning strike, bird strike, rain/rain erosion, and on-orbit debris/micrometeoroid hypervelocity impact have been proposed. In addition to design requirements, the importance of both compiling a comprehensive loads envelope and deriving time- and location-consistent loads for thermal protection system design and sizing is addressed. Including ascent abort trajectories as limit-load cases and on-orbit debris/micrometeoroid hypervelocity impact as one of the discrete-source-damage cases is imperative because of their significant impact on thermal protection system design and resulting performance, reliability, and operability. General features of a suite of integrated airframe concepts is summarized, and the specific details of a metallic thermal protection system concept having design flexibility that enables weight and operability to be traded and balanced is described.

AB A new metallic thermal-protection-system concept has been designed, analyzed, and fabricated. A specific location on a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle was selected to develop loads and requirements needed to design prototype panels. The design loads include ascent and entry heating rates, pressures, acoustics, and accelerations. Additional design issues were identified and discussed. An iterative sizing procedure was used to size the thermal protection system panels for thermal and structural loads as part of an integrated wall construction that included the thermal protection system and cryogenic tank structure. The panels were sized to maintain acceptable temperatures on the underlying structure and to operate under the design structural loading. Detailed creep. analyses were also performed on critical components of the panels. Four 18-in.-square metallic thermal-protection-system panels were fabricated. A lightweight, thermally compliant support system to connect the thermal protection system to the cryogenic tank structure was designed and fabricated.

AB KSR-III, the third Korean Sounding Rocket, was launched successfully at Anheung, Korea on Nov. 28, 2002. One of the scientific missions of KSR-III was to measure the stratospheric ozone density profile by using an onboard four-channel UV radiometer. The apogee of the rocket was 42.8 km, and the total flight time was 231 s. The UV radiometer onboard the KSR-III measured the attenuation of solar radiation during ascending phase to obtain a vertical profile of the ozone density. The detector has UV channels centered at 255, 290, and 310 nm and a visible channel at 450 nm for attitude reference. Because the measurement of the solar radiation depends on the response function of the sensor, calibrations of interference filters and phototubes must be done. The optical calibration system consists of a monochromator, an optical power meter, light detectors, standard light sources, a control PC, and data acquisition software. The application of the rocket-borne UV radiometer onboard the KSR-III to the Ozone measurement are presented together with the calibration results from the integrated calibration system at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute. Using the calibration results and the in-situ measurement data, we obtained the ozone number density profile, and compared with other measurements.

AB Based on high level safety and cost requirements, system architects and subsystem engineers are called upon to provide requirements at a lower level during the conceptual design phase of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). This paper describes an event tree based methodology for quantitatively assessing the limits of some of the lower-level Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) requirements during RLV conceptual design. The metrics assessed in the paper are fault detection coverage, false alarm probability, fault isolation capability, probability of IVHM failing to detect a fault, and safety allocation. The fault detection and isolation metrics were assessed based on their applicability with respect to cost and safety in the mission and turnaround phase of the RLV operations. The paper shows that the mission-phase requirement for IVHM fault detection coverage for a subsystem is large (more stringent) when IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, the failure remediation probability is small, and the subsystem is already reliable. The requirement on IVHM false alarm rate in the mission phase is small (more stringent) when the subsystem is reliable, IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, and IVHM should cause fewer false aborts.
   The paper concludes by stressing the use of appropriate system analysis and optimization in allocating IVHM requirements to a subsystem of the RLV. Although the paper is written from an IVHM and RLV perspective, it is targeted towards system engineers/architects who are interested in estimating the effects of fault detection and isolation requirements during conceptual design.

AB The NASA Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program is evaluating various concepts for less expensive and reduced-risk access to space. Critical to these goals are more reliable and easily maintained vehicles, with high fidelity Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) systems, rapid turn-around time and dual-use technology. The initial application of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) on the Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) Architecture 6 Concept has helped to define key assumptions necessary to make the development of the Architecture 6 concept successful. While the final figures of merit (FOMs) will be based on successfully developing and testing the vehicle, preliminary FOMs can be used now for basic trades between propulsion and staging concepts, thus providing a valuable tool to evaluate the overall trade space between highly divergent concepts. Reliability analysis, Probabilistic Design Methods (PDM), and Probabilistic Risk Assessment can be integrated to evaluate overall systems architecture, a complete mission model, and a fleet logistics model. In addition, the PRA may be used to evaluate and compare a high and low energy crew escape system.

AB Traditional accident models were devised to explain losses caused by failures of physical devices in relatively simple systems. They are less useful for explaining accidents in software-intensive systems and for nontechnical aspects of safety such as organizational culture and human decision-making. This paper describes how systems theory can be used to form new accident models that better explain system accidents (accidents arising from the interactions among components rather than individual component failure), software-related accidents, and the role of human decision-making. Such models consider the social and technical aspects of systems as one integrated process and may be useful for other emergent system properties such as security. The loss of a Milstar satellite being launched by a Titan/Centaur launch vehicle is used as an illustration of the approach.

AB SKYLON is a single stage to orbit (SSTO) winged spaceplane designed to give routine low cost access to space. At a gross takeoff weight of 275 tonnes of which 220 tonnes is propellant the vehicle is capable of placing 12 tonnes into an equatorial low Earth orbit. The vehicle configuration consists of a slender fuselage containing the propellant tankage and payload bay with delta wings located midway along the fuselage carrying the SABRE engines in axisymmetric nacelles on the wingtips. The vehicle takes off and lands horizontally on it's own undercarriage. The fuselage is constructed as a multilayer structure consisting of aeroshell, insulation, structure and tankage. SKYLON employs extant or near term materials technology in order to minimise development cost and risk. The SABRE engines have a dual mode capability. In rocket mode the engine operates as a closed cycle liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen high specific impulse rocket engine. In airbreathing mode (from takeoff to Mach 5) the liquid oxygen flow is replaced by atmospheric air, increasing the installed specific impulse 3-6 fold. The airflow is drawn into the engine via a 2 shock axisymmetric intake and cooled to cryogenic temperatures prior to compression. The hydrogen fuel flow acts as a heat sink for the closed cycle helium loop before entering the main combustion chamber.

AB Improvements to spectral and temporal solar irradiances are often based upon increasingly accurate and precise measurements as well as upon better understood physics. This paper reports on one example in an emerging trend for solar irradiance models that can be characterized as hybrid irradiance modeling. Empirical and physics-based modeling of irradiances are combined and take advantage of strengths within both methods to provide a variety of solar irradiance products to science and engineering users. The SOLAR2000 (S2K) version 1.24 model (v1.24) described in this paper has gone through 17 upgrades since it was originally released in 1999 as v0.10 and now incorporates three theoretical continua, 13 rocket spectra, and time series data from five satellites using 17 instruments. S2K currently produces six integrated irradiance proxies for science and engineering applications in addition to spectrally resolved irradiances in three common wavelength formats. Integrated irradiance proxies include the E10.7 integrated EUV energy flux, Q(EUV) total thermospheric EUV heating rate, P-EUV hemispheric EUV power, T-infinity exospheric temperature, R-SN derived sunspot number, and S integrated spectrum. Besides three spectral wavelength and six integrated irradiance formats there are three time frames of historical, nowcast, and forecast irradiance products produced by four model grades. The Research Grade (RG) model is developed for aeronomical and climate change research, the Professional Grade (PG) model is developed for space system engineering applications, the Operational Grade (OP) model is developed for institutional and agency real-time operational space weather applications, and the System Grade (SY) model is developed for commercial operational and production applications. This report describes these model characteristics as well as the current state of operational irradiances which are now in the second release of a first generation forecast methodology. Forecast Generation 1x (FGen 1x) produces a 72-h forecast of E10.7 at high solar activity with 1-sigma uncertainties at the 8 % level. All SOLAR2000 irradiance products from each of the versions, grades, and forecast generations are compliant with the ISO CD 21348 solar irradiance draft standard being developed as a standard method to specify all solar irradiances for use by space systems and materials users.

AB Microgravity environment allows the study of the formation of zeolites and related materials under almost convection free conditions without the interference of phenomena related to density differences. Results obtained from Sounding Rocket microgravity experiments (MAXUS4 and MAXUS5) gave surprising insights into the mechanism of formation of zeolites with MFI topology. But these experiments also emphasized the need for longer duration missions. The opportunity of performing longer microgravity experiments oil zeolite structures was offered in the frame of a Taxi-Flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in November 2002 organized by Belgium and the European Space Agency (ESA). Two facilities were designed for this flight. During the development of these two experiments it could be demonstrated that the technical obstacles due to chemically aggressive media, high process temperatures, and pressures call be overcome. ESA is currently Studying the possibility of developing a dedicated insert for zeolite experiments to be used with the optical and diagnostic platform of the Protein Crystallisation Diagnostic Facility (PCDF) that will fly integrated in the European Drawer Rack oil the Columbus Laboratory starting in 2004. This paper presents recent experiences with zeolitization proceSSeS under inicrogravity conditions and tile opportunities for zeolite investigations aboard the International Space Station (ISS) offered by the new hardware.

AB NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) calls for investments in Space Shuttle safety upgrades, second generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) advanced development and third generation RLV and in-space research and technology. NASA's third generation launch systems are to be fully reusable and operational by 2025. The goals for third generation launch systems are to reduce cost by a factor of 100 and improve safety by a factor of 10,000 over current systems. The Advanced Space Transportation Program Office (ASTP) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL has the agency lead to develop third generation space transportation technologies. The Hypersonics Investment Area, part of ASTP, is developing the third generation launch vehicle technologies in two main areas, propulsion and airframes. The program's major investment is in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion since it offers the greatest potential for meeting the third generation launch vehicles. The program will mature the technologies in three key propulsion areas, scramjets, rocket-based combined cycle and turbine-based combination cycle. Ground and flight propulsion tests are being planned for the propulsion technologies. Airframe technologies will be matured primarily through ground testing.
   This paper describes NASA's activities in hypersonics. Current programs, accomplishments, future plans and technologies that are being pursued by the Hypersonics Investment Area under the Advanced Space Transportation Program Office will be discussed.

TI Low cost Mercury orbiter and-sample return missions using solar sail
   propulsion
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of solar sail propulsion is investigated for both Mercury orbiter (MO) and Mercury sample return missions (MeSR). It will be demonstrated that solar sail propulsion can significantly reduce launch mass and enhance payload mass fractions for MO missions, while MeSR missions are enabled, again with a relatively low launch mass. Previous investigations of MeSR type missions using solar electric propulsion have identified a requirement for an Ariane V launcher to deliver a lander and sample return vehicle. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that, in principle, a MeSR mission can be enabled using a single Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, leading to significant reductions in launch mass and mission costs. Similarly, it will be demonstrated that the full payload of the ESA Bepi Colombo orbiter mission can be delivered to Mercury using a Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, rather than Ariane V, again leading to a reduction in mission costs.

AB DLR-TUBSAT is a microsatellite joint project of the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Technical University of Berlin (TUB) and the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). It was launched on 26 March 1999 with the Indian Polar Spacecraft Launch Vehicle (PSLV) as secondary payload. DLR-TUBSAT was designed for interactive earth observation where the target is not identified in advance, a search action is involved or a target has to be visually followed. Whereas classical earth observation uses nadir pointing satellites the design of DLR-TUBSAT was made for using interactive control strategies. Since the start of the operation many different strategies for different acquisition and operation modes are developed and tested. A result of this development are new software programs on satellite and ground segment and new ground control procedures. Possible applications of the produced earth observation data could be defined and were integrated in the new control strategies. DLR-TUBSAT showed that it can serve new market areas of earth observation and new customers, which can not use or do not want to use classical earth observation satellites. The main advantages are the interactive search abilities, very high repeat cycles (I day) and the low mass and low costs of the satellite system. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We describe a robust procedure for the extraction and high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis Of L-ascorbate (vitamin C), glutathione (gamma-glutamyl cysteinylglycine), and their respective oxidized forms from various plant tissues. Parameters such as the choice of extraction buffer, tissue disruption technique, sample stability, and separation conditions have all been optimized. In particular we found that the inclusion of the reducing agent dithiothreitol as a "stabilizer" in extracts with high phenolic content actually promoted oxidation of these antioxidants. Further, by using commercially available short "Rocket" HPLC columns in combination with high mobile-phase flow rates, analysis times were reduced to only 6 min, making the method suitable for the high-resolution screening of large numbers of samples.

AB A space mission consists of more than just a spacecraft and scientific instruments. It also includes a ground system to support communications, command and telemetry processing and archiving, a mission operations team, and a launch vehicle. Before launch, all of these elements must be tested together in an integrated fashion. The Mission System Engineer is the chief architect of this system, is responsible for all technical aspects of the entire system, and directs trade studies to determine the partitioning of functions among subsystems and elements of the entire system. The TIMED mission and system were designed around a concept of low-cost mission operations. This concept was realized through the creation of a highly autonomous spacecraft, instrument operations that are decoupled from spacecraft operations, and payload (instrument) operations centers that are geographically distributed and connected through the Internet.

AB It is now feasible to construct highly capable 'nanosatellites' (i.e. sub-10 kg satellites) to provide cost-effective and rapid-response orbiting test vehicles for advanced space missions and technologies. The UK's first nanosatellite, SNAP-1-designed and built by Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) staff-is an example of such a test vehicle: in this case, built with the primary objective of demonstrating that a sophisticated, fully agile nanosatellite can be constructed rapidly, and at very low cost, using an extension of the modular-COTS-based design philosophy pioneered by SSC for its microsatellites.
   SNAP-1 was successfully launched into orbit on 28 June 2000 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome on board a Russian Cosmos rocket. It flew alongside a Russian Cospas-Sarsat satellite called Nadezhda, and an SSTL-built Chinese microsatellite, called Tsinghua-1.
   The first year of operations has been highly successful, with SNAP-1 becoming the first nanosatellite to have demonstrated full attitude and orbit control, via its miniature momentum-wheel-based attitude control system and its butane-propellant-based propulsion system. This paper reviews the initial results of the SNAP-1 mission.

AB Aladdin, one of five Concept Study winners for NASA's Discovery A098-OSS-04, was a mission to obtain samples from the two Martian moons using several unique mission design and sample collection techniques. The mission design enabled sample return from two bodies at the relatively low cost of a Discovery-class mission. It featured a phasing orbit, multiple flybys of the Martian moons, and a short overall mission duration. The phasing orbit greatly reduced the post-launch Deltav requirement, thus permitting the use of a Delta II launch vehicle. Multiple moon flybys provided ample opportunities for sample collection and science observations. The short overall mission duration reduced program costs. Aladdin's sample collection, unlike traditional sample collection methods, used a "launch-and-catch" technique to obtain samples. Projectiles would be launched to the moon's surface during a close flyby and the ejected particles gathered for Earth return and analysis. This innovative technique, the Aladdin mission, and the possible extension of the technique to other bodies are described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Mars micromission (MM) spacecraft (MMSC) is a multi-purpose platform capable of orbiting Mars for communications/navigation and science payloads or for precision Mars flybys to drop up to six probes. An MMSC is launched as a secondary payload on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, to GTO using the Ariane 5 structure for auxiliary payloads (ASAP5). The maximum launch wet mass is 222 kg and can include up to 45 kg of payload depending on DeltaV needs. The on-board propulsion system is used for maneuvering in the Earth-Moon system and injecting the spacecraft into Mars transfer orbit and, if needed, Mars orbit. The first MMSC to be launched in early 2003 will be a Communications/Navigation (Comm/Nav) Orbiter. JPL is responsible for the Comm/Nav payload. Ball Aerospace, working with JPL, provides the multi-purpose spacecraft bus, system integration and test, and assists in operations over the 3 year mission duration. This paper summarizes the baseline spacecraft concept for the first Mars Com/Nav mission as defined at the start of the program in February 2000 and describes the spacecraft bus implementation in more detail.

AB We consider in this paper the incompressible laminar flow in a porous channel with expanding or contracting walls. While the head-end is closed by a compliant membrane, the downstream end is left unobstructed. For symmetric injection or suction along the uniformly expanding porous walls, the Navier-Stokes equations are reduced to a single, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation. The latter is obtained via similarity transformations in both time and space. The resulting equation is then solved both numerically and asymptotically, using perturbations in the crossflow Reynolds number R. Two separate approaches are presented for each of the injection and suction cases, respectively. For the large injection case, the governing equation is first integrated and the resulting third-order differential equation is solved using the method of variation of parameters. For the large suction case, the governing equation is first simplified near the wall and then solved using successive approximations. Results are then correlated and compared for variations in R and the dimensionless wall expansion rate alpha. For injection-induced flow, the asymptotic solution becomes more accurate when R/alpha is increased. Its deviation from the classic sinusoidal profile arising in nonexpanding channels becomes less significant with successive increases in R. For suction-induced flows, faster wall contractions increase the effective Reynolds number -(alpha + R), thus leading to more precise approximations. For the same absolute value of R, the suction-flow approximation tends to be the most accurate of the two and the least sensitive to variations in alpha. As -(alpha + R) is increased, the suction profile approaches the linear form anticipated in nonexpanding channels. By comparison with the injection-induced flow, suction is characterized by improved accuracy, sharper flow turning, and larger shear.

ID DESIGN; PROPULSION; SELECTION
AB As part of phase 2 of the X-33 Program, NASA selected an integrated lifting body/aerospike engine configuration as the study vehicle for the conceptual analysis of a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle. A team at NASA Langley Research Center participated in the screening and evaluation of a number of proposed vehicle configurations in the early phases of the conceptual design process. The performance analyses that supported these studies were conducted to assess the effect of the vehicle's lifting capability, linear aerospike engine, and metallic thermal protection system on the weight and performance of the vehicle. These performance studies were conducted in a multidisciplinary fashion that indirectly linked the trajectory optimization with weight estimation and aerothermal analysis tools. This approach was necessary to develop optimized ascent and entry trajectories that met all vehicle design constraints. Significant improvements in ascent performance were achieved when the vehicle Hew a lifting trajectory and varied the engine mixture ratio during flight. Also, a considerable reduction in empty weight was possible by adjusting the total oxidizer-to-fuel and liftoff thrust-to-weight ratios. However, the optimal ascent flight profile had to be altered to ensure that the vehicle could be trimmed in pitch using only the How diverting capability of the aerospike engine. Likewise, the optimal entry trajectory had to be tailored to meet thermal protection system heating rate and transition constraints while satisfying a crossrange requirement.

ID SECTOR
AB A miniature double-focusing mass spectrometer with an 8 mm radius was tested at the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL) at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). The purpose of these experiments was to provide residual gas-analysis and single-ion-monitoring capabilities for the vacuum chamber where NASA's new plasma propulsion system, the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR), is being developed. The instrument used here was an alpha (alpha) version of the Integrated Leak Detector System (ILD 50) and represents a smaller version of the original 20 mm-radius Compact Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer prototype (CDFMS) developed at the University of Minnesota. The instrument successfully provided gas-composition information on the vacuum test chamber and several different plasma formulations, provided resolving powers close to the theoretical value of 40 at full width half maximum (FWHM) and demonstrated an operational mass range of 1-50 Da.

TI Pioneer Rocketplane conceptual design study
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
AB The Pioneer Rocketplane is a two-seat, F-111-sized aircraft powered by turbofan engines and a kerosene/oxygen-burning RD-120 rocket engine that, using an expendable upper stage, boosts a 3000-lb satellite to a circular low Earth orbit. The Rocketplane takes off with its turbofan engines and climbs to approximately 20,000 ft, where it meets a tanker aircraft, taking on about 48,000 lb of kerosene jet fuel. The Rocketplane then moves to a second tanker aircraft, where it takes on about 130,000 lb of liquid oxygen. After disconnecting from the tanker, the vehicle ignites its rocket engine and climbs to an altitude of 70 miles. Although never reaching orbit itself, the Rocketplane is outside the sensible atmosphere. It opens its payload bay doors and releases the upper stage, which ignites and delivers the satellite payload to its intended low Earth orbit. The doors are then closed, and the aircraft reenters the atmosphere and lands. The second phase conceptual design study is described in which prior configuration design and optimization studies have been integrated into a viable baseline air vehicle concept on which performance analysis is conducted.

TI Numerical analysis on separation dynamics of strap-on boosters in the
   atmosphere
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
ID LAUNCH-VEHICLE; EQUATIONS; EULER
AB A numerical technique for simulating the separation dynamics of strap-on boosters jettisoned in the dense atmosphere is presented. Six-degree-of-freedom, rigid-body equations of motion are integrated into the three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes solution procedure to determine the dynamic motions of strap-ons. An automated chimera overset grid technique is introduced to achieve maximum efficiency for multibody dynamic motion, and a domain division technique is implemented in order to reduce the computational cost required to find interpolation points in the chimera grids. The flow solver is validated by comparing the computed results around the Titan IV launch vehicle with experimental data. The complete analysis process is then applied to the H-II launch vehicle, a major rocket in Japan's space program, and the KSR-III sounding rocket, a three-stage vehicle being developed in Korea. From the analyses separation trajectories of strap-on boosters are predicted, and aerodynamic characteristics around the vehicles at each time interval are examined. And separation-impulse devices, generally introduced for safe separation of strap-ons, are properly modeled, and the guideline map of additional jettisoning force and moment for safe separation is presented.

AB Recently, there has been an increased need for evolved space transportation and the research of reusable rocket which enable low cost and high reliability and is generating a lot of interest all over the world. In the USA, the development of reusable launch vehicle "Venture Star" which will be used instead of space shuttle is planned and its half scale model "X-33" was developed for the first flight in 1999. In Japan, there has been agreement on the main points to develop the rocket type RLV based on the technology of H-IIA, HOPE-X before developing space plane type RLV. The planned reusable rocket engine was LOX/LH2 as propellant, has 100-200 ton thrust and has a throttling capability. In addition, long life and high reliability are required for the engine system including LOX/LH2 turbopump.
   The paper introduces some key technologies for the reusable turbopump which IHI is promoting for research and development with NAL and Tohoku University. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB High-performance liquid (HPLC) and thin-layer (TLC) chromatographic methods for the detection and quantification of diazeniumdiolates are described. The HPLC determinations were made using a Rocket Platinum NH2 column (7 x 53 mm, 100-Angstrom pore size, 3-mum particle size), under isocratic conditions with mixtures of acetonitrile, methanol, and water containing 0.1% diethylamine (v/v), at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min, a column temperature of 22degreesC, and UV detection at 250 nm. The TLC determinations were similarly made using Merck NH2 F-254S precoated glass plates (similar to2 x 5 cm, 5-mum particle size, 0.2-mm layer thickness) with mixtures of acetonitrile, methanol, and water containing 0.1% diethylamine (v/v). Preexisting traces of carcinogenic nitrosamines were detected in some samples of diazeniumdiolates. The methods provide a more efficient means of characterizing the purity of diazeniumdiolate samples prepared for use in biomedical applications than older procedures which rely on differential absorbance measurements at 250 and 350 nm, respectively.

AB In this paper, internal ballistics of solid rocket motors (SRM), in which the, grain is burned from inside (inner burning surface) or from both inside and outside (inner and outer burning surfaces), is numerically simulated. The solution domain includes two passages and a converging-diverging nozzle. It is discretized using a control-volume finite-element method. Governing equations of the quasi one-dimensional Euler flow are integrated over each control volume. The flux-vector components are related to the nodal values using a physical influence scheme. Erosive burning is incorporated in the flowfield calculation using a quasi-steady model. In cases with inner and outer burning surfaces, the resulting system of equations deviates from a block tri-diagonal one. Therefore, special care is needed for the efficient solution of this system of equations. To evaluate performance of the present algorithm, transient flow fields of several SRMs with different burning surfaces are simulated, and the results compared with the experimental data and numerical results. The excellent agreement observed in all cases validates the algorithm and approves its accuracy. For SRMs with inner and outer burning surfaces, possibility of their modeling with an equivalent motor is also investigated. In addition, a SRM with area transition along the grain is simulated to demonstrate the general capability of the present code.

AB In this paper a new moving-boundary algorithm is presented for the solution of two-dimensional flows on unstructured grids. Application of this algorithm is investigated by simulating the internal ballistics of solid rocket motors (SRM). Solution domain is discretised to a number of triangular elements using control-volume based finite-element (CVFE) method. Euler equations are integrated over the control volumes, and Roe's flux-difference scheme is used to evaluate flux vectors at the control-volume surfaces. To eliminate numerical errors due to grid movement, geometric conservation laws (GCL) are carefully implemented. The present algorithm recognises locations along the moving boundaries where the stretched elements result in a distorted grid. To avoid this, new elements are inserted through a local re-triangulation of elements in these regions, Internal ballistics of three SRMs with cylindrical grains burning from inside, are numerically simulated. Using a heat transfer model, erosive burning is included in calculation of propellant burning rate. The aftend of third SRM is tapered to demonstrate capability of present algorithm in solving problems with moving boundaries approaching each other. Very good agreement is observed between the time variations of head-end chamber pressure, obtained from the present work and the other methods,

TI Active structural acoustic control of a launch vehicle fairing using

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES

DT Article
ID RADIATED SOUND; INTERIOR NOISE
AB This study investigated the feasibility of using active structural acoustic control with monolithic piezoceramic actuators to reduce the low frequency noise transmission through rocket fairings during launch. Closed-loop simulation results are presented using a fully coupled structural acoustic model of a lightly damped composite fairing structure with integrated piezoceramic actuators. Constraints were placed on controller mass and maximum allowable actuator voltage in order to provide a baseline of reasonable expected performance. Realistic disturbance levels were used in the simulations, and two disturbance cases were considered with significantly different spectral characteristics. Simulations were conducted to compare the effects of actuator thickness, covered surface area, and maximum actuator voltage on controller performance and energy requirements. Linear Quadratic Regulator control laws were computed assuming full-state feedback using three design approaches. The results provide significant insight into the noise transmission problem and to the physical dynamics of the control approach. The best-case reduction in the spatially averaged interior acoustic response was determined to be approximately 2.5 dB over the 0-300 Hz bandwidth.

TI Microrockets for Smart Dust
SO SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper details the design and fabrication of millimeter-scale solid propellant rockets for one-time deployment of wireless sensor platforms; known as Smart Dust. Each microrocket assembly is an integrated system, incorporating a combustion chamber, composite propellant grain, nozzle, igniter, and thermoelectric power converter. Solid propellant is advantageous for a millimeter-scale single-use device because of its simple implementation, unlike liquid propellants, which require a more elaborate system of pumps and valves. Therefore the total system volume and complexity are minimized.
   One type of combustion chamber was fabricated in silicon; however, thermal losses to the silicon sidewalls during combustion through a 1:5 mm(2) cross section of fuel were too high to reliably maintain a burn. Successful combustion was demonstrated in cylindrical alumina ceramic combustion chambers with thermal conductivities five times lower than silicon and cross sections of 1-8 mm(2). Thrusts of 10-15 mN were measured for ceramic rockets weighing under 1 g, with specific impulses up to 15 s.
   Silicon nozzles integrated with polysilicon microheaters and thermopiles for thermal power conversion were microfabricated in a single process. Fuel ignition by polysilicon microheaters suspended on a low-stress nitride (LSN) membrane was demonstrated. Microheaters require less than 0.5 W of power to ignite a propellant composed primarily of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) with ammonium perchlorate (AP) oxidizer. They are suspended for thermal isolation through bulk post-processing by a. backside deep reactive ion etch (DRIE). The etched hole beneath the igniter area also serves as a nozzle through which high-velocity combustion gases exit the rocket. Thermopiles, which generate voltages proportional to hot and cold junction temperature differentials, have been fabricated in the same process as igniters, and span backside DRIE thermal isolation cavities. Ten junction thermopiles produced a maximum power of 20 muW. With potential temperature differences of hundreds of degrees and a total of 120 thermocouple junctions fabricated on the silicon nozzle chip, hundreds of milliwatts of power could feasibly be produced during the microrocket's flight and used to augment the Smart Dust power supply.

AB An aerodynamic model for a rocket-based combined-cycle engine-airframe integrated vehicle using an osculating cone waverider forebody is presented. Emphasis is placed on the hypersonic portion of the vehicle trajectory, where scramjet operation occurs. An analytical model for the compression flowfield in the engine is developed, validated, and incorporated into a finite-rate chemistry engine model for hydrogen and air. Issues of off-design Mach number, angle of attack, and performance through a trajectory are addressed for a nonoptimal example vehicle. The results show that the aerodynamic performance of this class of engine-airframe integrated vehicle can be rapidly solved and incorporated into a vehicle design and trajectory code.

TI French-Russian partnership on hypersonic wide-range ramjets
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB France and Russia have an ongoing fruitful cooperation to jointly develop a wide-range ramjet (WRR) able to accelerate a reusable launch vehicle from similar to Mach 3 to Mach 12. The WRR engine has a fully variable internal geometry, which enables a high performance level over the whole Mach-number range. Propulsion-oriented system studies have been conducted both on 30-tons-class experimental flight vehicle and on 500 tons-class single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable vehicles. In particular, the WRR airbreathing propulsion system has been integrated into a SSTO generic vehicle. Then, trajectory simulation, using mass, propulsion, and aerodynamic models, has allowed determining the payload as a function of total takeoff weight, confirming the utility of the variable geometry features of the WRR. Preliminary experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for several years to design the WRR prototype. The present contribution describes the synthesis of this engine and provides an overview of this common work. Consideration is given to various aspects of the project, including system studies, technology development, and analyses using contour control codes.

TI Synthesis of a FESTIP airbreathing TSTO space transportation system
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The recent Future European Space Transportation Investigation Program (FESTIP) system study has included one two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) concept with an airbreathing first stage and a rocket-propelled second stage. Because of the pure acceleration mission from Kourou/CSG and the limited technology level that should be applied, turbojet engines for staging at Mach 4 were assumed in the first stage. Two different TSTO configurations were studied in parallel: the fully integrated delta-wing configuration and the less integrated trapezoidal-wing configuration. The predesign activities were completed in July 1998, and a better data basis is now available for comparing the two design options in terms of launcher size, performance, complexity, operations, and cost. In spite of the high aerodynamic integration of the delta-wing configuration, its overall performance is rather limited because of weak turbojet performance at high Mach numbers and altitudes. Inclusion of a ramjet for operation beyond Mach 3 would increase the optimum staging Mach number and overall complexity of this TSTO concept The trapezoidal-wing configuration makes best use of a boost to beyond Mach 1.3 by rocket engines of the second stage, which are fueled during the combined ascent by cross feeding from the first stage. The limited analyses performed on the double-wing aerodynamic interaction between the mated stages has not revealed any severe objections. This TSTO concept has exceeded the current FESTIP performance requirements, delivering 9 Mg into equatorial 250-km-reference orbit and 3 Mg into polar 250-km-reference orbit. With respect to cost, this launcher could be optimized by avoiding any stage integration. Then the internal tank arrangement of the first stage is not penalized by additional geometric constraints, and stage separation becomes simpler. Takeoff mass of the trapezoidal-wing configuration is 470 Mg compared to 430 Mg for the delta-wing configuration. Nevertheless, the vehicle dry mass, which drives development cost, is 40 Mg heavier for the delta-wing configuration. The absolute cost figures of both TSTO options are significantly higher than those of the single-stage-to-orbit vehicles investigated in the FESTIP program.

AB Predicted performance and features of a combined propulsion concept for a small reusable launch vehicle known as KLIN (TM) (meaning wedge in Russian) Cycle are discussed. The KLIN Cycle consists of a thermally integrated deeply cooled turbojet and a liquid rocket engine. The objective of this concept is to achieve a high-pressure ratio in a simple, lightweight turbojet engine. The proven result is an exceptional engine thrust-to-weight ratio, as well as improved specific impulse and mass fraction of the launcher. When based on the RL10 engine family, the KLIN Cycle makes a small single-stage-to-orbit and two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles feasible and very economically attractive.

AB An overview of the activities associated with the aerodynamic database that is being developed in support of NASA's Hyper-X scramjet flight experiments is provided. Three flight tests are planned as part of the Hyper-X program. Each will utilize a small, non-recoverable research vehicle with an airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion engine. The research vehicles will be individually rocket boosted to the scramjet engine test points at Mach 7 and 10. The research vehicles will then separate from the first stage booster vehicle and the scramjet engine test will be conducted before the terminal decent phase of the flight. An overview is provided of the activities associated with the development of the Hyper-X aerodynamic database, including wind-tunnel test activities and parallel computational fluid dynamics analysis efforts for all phases of the Hyper-X flight tests. A brief summary of the Hyper-X research vehicle aerodynamic characteristics is provided, including the direct and indirect effects of the airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion system operation on the basic airframe stability and control characteristics. Brief comments on the planned postflight data analysis efforts are also included.

ID MODEL
AB Underexpanded rocket exhaust plumes generated in a test-bed facility are studied experimentally. Infrared (IR) images of the plume have been obtained with an IR camera equipped with narrow bandpass filters. The spectral distribution of the IR emission has been measured with a spectroradiometer. Numerical simulations of the exhaust plume have been conducted. The gas-dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the flowfield were computed by the General Aerodynamic Simulation Program computational fluid-dynamic code. On the basis of the simulated flowfield, the IR radiation was numerically calculated by using a computer program INFRAD, which has been developed for this purpose. The program calculates the radiation transfer through the plume using the statistical narrowband model technique. It allows simulation of the IR plume images as well as the local and the space-integrated plume spectra. The simulated and experimental results agree well.

AB We present an atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe with integrated piezoresistive read-out. The probe consists of a micromachined cantilever with a tip at the end. The cantilever is a multilayer structure with its thickness defined by etch-stop and the bending controlled by fitting the thicknesses of the thin films constituting the cantilever. The AFM probe has an integrated tip made of a thick sputtered silicon layer, which is deposited after the probe has been defined and just before the cantilevers are released. The tips are so-called rocket tips made by reactive ion etching. We present probes with polysilicon resistors for demonstrating the fabrication principle. The probes have been characterised with respect to noise and deflection sensitivity and have been applied in AFM imaging. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A theoretical formulation is presented for predicting transient (leading to steady state) heat transfer characteristics through the thermal insulation of cryogenic rocket propellant tanks. Only the cylindrical sides of the propellant tanks are studied while the rocket is on the launch pad in a holding condition. Effects of direct solar radiation, Earth-reflected/emitted radiation, and mind velocity are considered for estimation of heat lends to the propellants. A finite difference technique using a simple explicit method is adopted to establish time-dependent temperature distributions across several layers of the integrated insulation package. Stability, accuracy, and computational requirements of the technique are reviewed with simple implicit and Crank-Nicolson solution schemes. Computed results are compared with Galerkin finite element solutions using lineal and quadratic polynomial interpolants. Formulations for these finite element methods are also derived. The model can be used for characterizing insulation material, thickness optimization, estimation of boil-off rate, and verification of lower limit temperature at the outer surface. Some results based on relevant input data are presented.

AB The vibration control of the apparatus cabin of CZ-3A launch vehicle is investigated. A kind of bar-type viscoelastic damper is designed to control passively the low-frequency vibrations of the whole cabin structure. Three strategies are employed to control the high-frequency vibrations of the honeycomb plate at different frequencies: passive control with the constrained damping layer, integrated control combining the constrained damping layer with the piezoelectric actuator designed by authors, and controllable constrained damping layer, respectively. The experimental results show that the present integrated techniques can effectively suppress the vibrations of the apparatus cabin within a fairly broad frequency band.

AB The launching of a waterjet rocket has been a very popular idea in recent years. Its basic propulsion principle makes use of the high-pressurized air inside the rocket's main body to swiftly expel the water out of the nozzle and thus generate thrust. The waterjet rocket is characterized with nature, interest, combustionlessness, environmental friendliness, simplicity, and minimal cost. Moreover, it is a very good science model for propulsion analysis, design, experiment, and education because of an abundance of easily adjustable key parameters. This model also features separately stored energy and mass of the propellant, in contrast to a conventional rocket. However, related literature shows that no in-depth theoretical analysis of the waterjet rocket has been attempted for various reasons. In this research, the propulsion dynamics of a waterjet rocket is analyzed by simultaneously solving the momentum and the newly derived generalized power equations to predict its flight histogram, computationally, and convolutionally. This integrated energy approach synthesizes the internal and external dynamics analyses together and ingeniously takes full advantage of the clear power supply of pressurized air in a waterjet rocket. The analysis results are generally agreeable with the: experimental flight data. While the new power equation herein gives a complete spectrum of physical parameters to be manipulated, there will be wider room in quest of better rocket propulsion performance, especially through the heuristic research of this versatile but affordable waterjet rocket.

SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING

AB A 200-kW-class solar-electric orbital transfer-vehicle concept, Swarm, for deploying elements of future, very large solar-power satellites, has been developed. Swam is preintegrated with its payload on the ground and delivered into low Earth orbit aboard a reusable launch vehicle. The total mass initially deployed to an equatorial low Earth orbit is assumed to be 40 metric tons (mt)-divided roughly evenly between the transfer vehicle and its payload. The Swam? vehicle ferries the payload to geostationary orbit (GEO) in approximately 116 days using low-thrust Krypton thrusters powered by six large solar arrays. Once at GEO. the Swam? vehicle is disassembled to provide thrusters and propellant tanks for solar-power satellite station keeping. At an estimated mass of 20,000 mt per solar-power satellite and a nominal deployment rate of one satellite per year, over 1,000 one-way Swarm flights per year are required. Preliminary mass estimates for the Swarm transfer vehicle have been developed. A cost-estimating methodology suggests that further improvements are needed to achieve an acceptable cost for in-space transportation.

AB Improvements in the safety, reliability and affordability of current and future space transportation systems must be achieved if NASA is to perform its mission and if the U.S. space industry is to reach its full potential. m response to Presidential Policy in 1994, NASA, working with our industrial partners, initiated several efforts including the X-33, X-34, X37 and Advanced Space Transportation programs with the goal of demonstrating the technologies that could enable these goals. We have learned that emerging technologies will enable the needed advancements but that more development along multiple, competing paths is needed. We have learned that developing requirements diligently and in partnership with industry will allow us to better converge with commercial capabilities. We have learned that commercial markets are not growing as fast as projected earlier, but there are still possibilities in the near-term to pursue alternate paths that can make access to space mole robust. The goal of transitioning NASA's space transportation needs to commercial launch vehicles remains the key aim of our efforts and will require additional investment to reduce business and technical risks to acceptable levels.
   In response, NASA, in 1999, developed a comprehensive, integrated strategy for achieving these goals. The objective of the Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) was to integrate NASA's diverse space transportation activities into a single, comprehensive and integrated investment plan. The ISTP is based on the following five tenets:
   Focus on safety, reliability, cost and NASA mission definition trades to meet NASA's space transportation needs and to maximize use of U.S, aerospace industry capabilities and commercial market convergence.
   Enable a competition at an acceptable level of risk for development of a 2nd generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) no later than 2005.
   Develop an integrated architecture that includes, where applicable, related system concepts to meet NASA-unique space transportation needs on a commercial RLV and potentially provide NASA assured access to space on more than one launch vehicle.
   Secure safe, reliable, and cost-effective access to space in the far-term through investments in 3rd generation RLV technologies for earth-to-orbit and in-space applications.
   Ensure continued safe access to space through Space Shuttle safety upgrades until a replacement alternative has been demonstrated
   The ISTP contains investment plans for Space Shuttle safety upgrades, Crew Return Vehicle for the International Space Station, Space Station Alternate Access, 2(nd) Generation RLV Risk Mitigation and, Aerospace Base Research and Technology.

AB Water vapour concentration is one of the most important, yet one of the least known quantities of the mesosphere. Knowledge of water vapour concentration is the key to understanding many mesospheric processes, including the one that is primary focus of our investigation, Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC). The processes of formation and occurrence parameters of PMC constitute an interesting problem in their own right, but recent evidence had been provided which suggests that PMC are a critical indicator of climate change. In this context the feasibility of a low cost method of water vapour measurements using an instrument carried aloft by a sounding rocket has been examined and some of the results discussed. It is proposed to measure the strength of the 936nm water absorption line in a solar occultation configuration employing a CCD detector. This leads to the design of a small, low cost and low-mass instrument, which can be flown on a small rocket, of the type of the Orbital Sciences Corporation Viper 5. Alternatively the instrument can be flown as a "passenger" on larger rocket carrying other experiments. In either case flight costs are relatively low. Some performance simulations are presented showing that the instrument we have designed will be sufficiently sensitive to measure water vapor in concentrations that are expected at the summer mesopause, about 85 km height. Sufficient payload design work was carried out showing that the structural, thermal and electrical requirements for a flight on the Viper 5 rocket can be met and thus making the experiment feasible for a flight.
