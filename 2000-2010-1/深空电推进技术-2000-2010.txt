AB Exposure to cosmic radiation is today acknowledged as a major obstacle to human missions to Mars. In fact, in addition to the poor knowledge on the late effects of heavy ions in the cosmic rays, simple countermeasures are apparently not available. Shielding is indeed very problematic in space, because of mass problems and the high-energy of the cosmic rays, and radio-protective drugs or dietary supplements are not effective. However, the simplest countermeasure for reducing radiation risk is to shorten the duration time, particularly the transit time to Mars, where the dose rate is higher than on the planet surface. Here we show that using nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) rockets, the transit time could be substantially reduced to a point where radiation risk could be considered acceptable even with the current uncertainty on late effects.

AB The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is one of the high performance electric propulsion devices for future interplanetary applications. Helicon sources can produce high-density plasmas with high-ionization efficiency suitable for VASIMR, which usually use two electromagnets to produce the required magnetic field configuration. How to optimal design the solenoids and how to create the requisite B-field are the key factors to affect the characteristics and performance of the helicon plasma. In this paper, the magnets were designed and fabricated, and an experimental helicon source was presented. Two solenoids situated around the cylindrical quartz tube were used to create an expanding magnetic field of about 250 G in the center decreasing to a few tens of Gauss in the downstream diffusion region. The antenna was powered by a radio-frequency (RF) system of 13.56 MHz, which maximum changeable power is 500 W. Our helicon device was installed with vacuum chamber that is pumped down to a base pressure of about 0.001 Pa using cryopumps. Langmuir probe is mounted on to measure the plasma parameters. It is found that, when increasing the radio-frequency power or varying the magnetic field, both the plasma density and operating mode of helicon-wave ion are also changed. Permanent magnets (PM) and High temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets are also considered to use in the helicon source, and relative analyses are discussed. The details of further research are to investigate the relationship that the applied magnets affect on the efficiency and performance of the helicon plasma.

AB Dawn launched on 27 September 2007 on a mission to orbit main belt asteroids (4) Vesta in 2011-2012 and (1) Ceres in 2015. The operations team conducted an extensive set of assessments of the engineering subsystems and science instruments during the First 80 days of the mission. A major objective of this period was to thrust for one week with the ion propulsion system to verify flight and ground systems readiness for typical interplanetary operations. Upon successful conclusion of the checkout phase, the interplanetary cruise phase began, most of which will be devoted to thrusting. The flexibility afforded by the use of ion propulsion enabled the project to accommodate a launch postponement of more than three months caused by a combination of launch vehicle and tracking system readiness, unfavorable weather, and then conflicts with other launches. Even with the shift in the launch date, all of the science objectives are retained with the same schedule and greater technical margins. This paper describes the conclusion of the development phase of the project, launch operations, and the progress of mission operations through the conclusion of deterministic thrusting in October 2008.

ID MISSIONS
AB The use of electric propulsion was evaluated for transfer of communication satellites from geosynchronous transfer orbits to geosynchronous earth orbits. Recent communication satellite designs, normal launch vehicle delivery orbits, and integrated electric propulsion subsystems (with input powers less than nominal satellite power levels) were assumed to minimize required changes to present and near-term launchers and spacecraft. The capture fraction of recent communication satellites that could have been delivered was evaluated versus launcher delivery capability, launch site, and in-space propulsion characteristics. Electric propulsion significantly increases the capture fraction of launchers with geosynchronous transfer mass delivery capabilities less than (dependent on launch site) about 4500 to 5500 kg. Insertion times at given launch sites were found to be accurately specified by the satellite power-to-mass ratios and the assumed electric propulsion specific-impulse/efficiency characteristics. Insertion times less than 100 days were found for satellites with high power-to-mass ratios that used high thrust-to-power electric propulsion options. The influence of power for electric propulsion beyond that used for satellite payloads and housekeeping was also assessed, and insertion times less than a month will require powers significantly higher than presently installed.

AB Helicon sources have been proposed by at least two groups for generating ions for space propulsion: the Helicon Double Layer Thruster (HDLT) concept at the Australian National University and the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetohydrodynamic Rocket (VASIMR) concept at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These sources normally require a large electromagnet and power supply to produce the magnetic field. At this stage of research, emphasis has been on the plasma density and ion current that can be produced, but not much on the weight, size, impulse, and gas efficiency of the thruster. This paper concerns the source itself and shows that great savings in size and weight can be obtained by using specially designed permanent magnets (PMs). This PM helicon design, originally developed for plasma processing of large substrates, is extended here for ion thrusters of both the HDLT and VASIMR types. Measured downstream densities are on the order of 10(12) cm(-3), which should yield much higher ion currents than reported so far. The design principles have been checked experimentally, showing that the predictions of the theory and computations are reliable. The details of two new designs are given here to serve as examples to stimulate further research on the use of such sources as thrusters.

AB Nuclear electric ion propulsion is considered for three sample deep space missions starting from a 500 km low Earth orbit encompassing the transfer of a 100 MT payload into a 1500 km orbit around Mars, the rendezvous of a 10 MT payload with the Jovian moon Europa and the rendezvous of a similar payload with Saturn's moon Titan. Near term ion engine and space nuclear reactor technology are assumed. It is shown that nuclear electric ion propulsion offers more than twice the payload for the Mars mission relative to the case when a nuclear thermal rocket is used for the trans-Mars injection maneuver at Earth, and about the same payload advantage relative to the case when solar electric propulsion is used for the Mars heliocentric transfer. For missions to the outer planets nuclear electric ion propulsion increases the payload mass fraction by a factor of two or more compared with high thrust systems that utilize gravity assist trajectories.

ID TRAJECTORIES; POWER
AB Nuclear electric ion propulsion is considered for three sample deep space missions starting from a 500 km low Earth orbit encompassing the transfer of a 100 MT payload into a 1500 km orbit around Mars, the rendezvous of a 10 MT payload with the Jovian moon Europa and the rendezvous of a similar payload with Saturn's moon Titan. Near term ion engine and space nuclear reactor technology are assumed. It is shown that nuclear electric ion propulsion offers more than twice the payload for the Mars mission relative to the case when a nuclear thermal rocket is used for the trans-Mars injection maneuver at Earth, and about the same payload advantage relative to the case when solar electric propulsion is used for the Mars heliocentric transfer. For missions to the outer planets nuclear electric ion propulsion increases the payload mass fraction by a factor of two or more compared with high thrust systems that utilize gravity assist trajectories.

AB In the late 1950s, interest arose in the US to use electrostatic droplet sprayers as a new heavy charged particle source for electric space propulsion. Originally, charged droplets were produced from conductive organic liquids. Around 1960, first attempts were made to use liquid metals as the charge material. It was discovered that the device was a very high brightness source of metal ions, which could be focused to spots of nanometer dimensions. This liquid metal ion source (LMIS) has developed into a commercially exploited device for ion microbeam technology. In Europe, the potential of the LMIS as a very high specific impulse ion thruster has been recognized. Since the 1970s, development of cesium and, later, indium ion thrusters has been going on. Presently, the development is at an advanced stage. Contracts have been issued by ESA to equip microsatellites with an attitude control system based on field (ion) emission electric propulsion (FEEP). The first technological test to verify microgravity operation of the indium LMIS was performed in 1991 on the Russian MIR space station, and from 1992 the device has been exploited for active potential control of scientific satellites and for on-site planetary mass spectrometry in seven space missions. The first gas field-ionization source was flown as early as 1977 on a sounding rocket and in 1986 to comet Halley. Apart from these field emission devices actually flown, field ion- and electron devices are under development or discussion for a number of other space applications. The latest developments and future prospects are discussed. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Microwave discharge ion engines "mu 10" are dedicated to the main propulsion on the HAYABUSA asteroid explorer. In a development program, various tests and assessments were conducted on the ion engines and the spacecraft. They include endurance tests, an electromagnetic interference susceptibility test, an interference test between the plasma and communication microwave, a beam exhaust test on the spacecraft, assessments on the plasma interference with a solar array, and so on. The spacecraft was launched in deep space by the M-V rocket in May 2003. After vacuum exposure and several runs of baking for reduction of residual gas, the ion engine system established continuous acceleration of the spacecraft toward the asteroid ITOKAWA. The spacecraft passed through a perihelion of 0.86 astronomical unit (AU) in February 2004 and an aphelion of 1.1 AU in February 2001, becoming the first solar electric propulsion system to travel this far toward and away from the Sun. The HAYABUSA succeeded in rendezvousing with the target asteroid in September 2005.

AB Systems analyses were performed for a Titan Explorer Mission characterized by Earth-Saturn transfer stages using solar electric power generation and propulsion systems for primary interplanetary propulsion, as well as chemical propulsion for capture at Titan. An examination of a range of system factors was performed to determine their effect on the payload delivery capability to Titan. The effect of varying launch vehicle,type, solar array power level, ion thruster number, specific impulse, trip time, and Titan capture stage chemical propellant choice was investigated. The major purpose was to demonstrate the efficacy of applying advanced ion propulsion system technologies like NASA's evolutionary xenon thruster (NEXT), coupled with state-of-the-art (SOA) and advanced chemical technologies to a Flagship class mission. This study demonstrated that a NASA design reference mission (DRM) payload of 406 kg could be successfully delivered to Titan using the baseline advanced ion propulsion system in conjunction with SOA chemical propulsion for Titan capture. In addition, the solar electric propulsion system (SEPS)/chemical system of this study is compared to an all-chemical NASA DRM. Results showed that the NEXT-based SEPS/chemical system was able to deliver the required payload to Titan in 5 years less transfer time and on a smaller launch vehicle than the SOA chemical option.

AB Optimization of a spacecraft's interplanetary trajectory and electric propulsion system remains a complex and difficult problem. Simultaneously solving for the optimal trajectory, power level, and exhaust velocity can be difficult and time consuming. If the power system's technology level is unknown, multiple optimizations must be conducted to map out the trade space. Trajectories with constant-power, solar-power, variable-specific-impulse, and constant-specific-impulse low-thrust propulsion systems are analyzed and optimized. The technological variables, power system specific mass, propellant tank coefficient, structural coefficient, and the launch vehicle are integrated into the cost function allowing for maximization of the payload mass fraction. A classical solution is reviewed that allows trade studies to be conducted for constant-power, variable exhaust velocity systems. The analysis is expanded to include bounded-power constant specific impulse systems and solar electric propulsion spacecraft with constant and variable exhaust velocity engines. The cost function and mass fractions are dimensionless to allow for scaling of the spacecraft systems.

AB Conceptual in-space transfer stages, including those using solar electric propulsion and chemical propulsion with aerobraking or aerocapture assist at Mars, were evaluated. Roundtrip Mars sample return mission vehicles were analyzed to determine how technology selections influence payload delivery capability. Results show how specific engine, thruster, propellant, capture mode, trip time, and launch-vehicle technology choices would contribute to increasing payload delivered to Mars or decreasing the size of the required launch vehicles. Low-thrust trajectory analyses for solar-electric transfer were generated with the SEPTOP code.

AB Fusion propulsion for the exploration of the solar system is investigated. Minimum round-trip times for missions to Europa and Mars are given as a function of power/mass ratio. A preconceptual study of a spheromak-based, deuterium burning, fusion propulsion system is presented. The spheromak is sustained by inductive helicity injection with the diverted edge plasma becoming the rocket exhaust. Power/mass ratios of nearly 2 kW/kg appear possible, giving round-trip times of about 100 day for Mars and about one year for Europa. The vessel mass is 540 t not including fuel, a size suitable for human living. The I-SP is optimized for a trip to Europa and a trip to Mars and was found to vary between 10,000 to 40,000 s.

TI Low cost Mercury orbiter and-sample return missions using solar sail
   propulsion
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of solar sail propulsion is investigated for both Mercury orbiter (MO) and Mercury sample return missions (MeSR). It will be demonstrated that solar sail propulsion can significantly reduce launch mass and enhance payload mass fractions for MO missions, while MeSR missions are enabled, again with a relatively low launch mass. Previous investigations of MeSR type missions using solar electric propulsion have identified a requirement for an Ariane V launcher to deliver a lander and sample return vehicle. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that, in principle, a MeSR mission can be enabled using a single Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, leading to significant reductions in launch mass and mission costs. Similarly, it will be demonstrated that the full payload of the ESA Bepi Colombo orbiter mission can be delivered to Mercury using a Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, rather than Ariane V, again leading to a reduction in mission costs.

TI Optimization of electric thrusters for primary propulsion based on the
   rocket equation
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB During the last decade, electric propulsion systems have been established for orbit maintenance of satellites. More than 150 spacecraft are now equipped with almost 400 thrusters for this purpose. The current decade will see the use of electric propulsion for primary propulsion. Optimal mission parameters are determined for these tasks. Depending on the mission profile, ion thrusters, Hall thrusters, thermal arcjets, or magnetoplasmadynamics (MPD) thrusters are preferable. All electric propulsion systems have in common that they can be operated over a wide range of specific impulse and that the thrust efficiency and, therefore, the specific power of the propulsion system depend strongly on the specific impulse. The optimal specific impulse for a particular mission depends, therefore, on the kind of thruster and the chosen propellant. It is demonstrated that for MPD, ion, Hall ion, and thermal arcjet thrusters the optimal specific impulse for a particular mission can be determined by an optimization that is based on the rocket equation. In addition, when a simple cost function is used, the influence of the cost factors is explained. Finally, the results of a few missions for which electric propulsion systems have been selected as primary propulsion are discussed.

AB A key feature of future deep-space science missions will be the need for significantly greater on-board propulsion capability. To meet this need, ion propulsion based on the technology that flew on NASA's Deep Space I spacecraft has now entered the mainstream of propulsion options available for deep-space missions. The next most likely science mission to use ion propulsion is the comet nucleus sample return (CNSR) mission. CNSR has recently been identified by the Solar System Exploration Subcommittee as the highest priority new mission for NASA's Exploration of the Solar System theme. Ion propulsion for CNSR enables the use of a smaller, less expensive launch vehicle, and significantly shortens the overall trip time. A trade study for CNSR was performed to identify engine and system technology improvements, which provide the greatest mission benefits for the lowest additional risk. This trade study indicated that the maximum specific impulse of the ion engine should be increased from 3100 to 3800 s and that the maximum engine input power should be increased from 2.3 to 3.2 M Simultaneously the engine total propellant throughput capability must be increased from the 80-kg NSTAR design point to approximately 180 kg. A focused technology program to make these advances is underway. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Estimation of an opportunity of Mercury mission with use of solar
   electric propulsion
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Estimation of transport opportunities of delivery of a research spacecraft (SC) to Mercury with the use of launcher "Proton", chemical upper stage (ChUS) as "D" and solar electric propulsion upper stage (SEPS) on the basis of thrusters ESA-XX and SPT is analyzed. It is assumed that Russian launch vehicle "Proton" and upper state "Block D" deliver a spacecraft into the geocentric hyperbolic orbit. Then "Block D" is separated. The heliocentric arc of the trajectory and operations in the vicinity of Mercury are supported by SEPS. It is supposed, that the change of SEPS thrust value according to available electrical power occurs due to change in propellant (Xenon) flow rate. The problem was formulated as follows. For the known characteristics of the ChUS, the SC and its systems are required to determine the unknown design SC parameters, circuit of transfer and control program of a thrust vector, ensuring delivery in the vicinity of Mercury of maximum SC mass at a given transfer duration. Chosen parameters and control functions are: mass of ChUS propellant (or value of hyperbolic excess velocity connected with it), direction of hyperbolic excess velocity, launch date, the control program of the thrust vector of the ion-engine (orientation of a thrust vector, moments of the engine firings and shut-down).

TI Accomplishment and prospect of ISAS electric propulsion
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English

AB The electric propulsion is one of the promising choices because of its high specific impulse when one would like to give a rise to the limited payload capability of the launch vehicle. Especially in a long-term mission or a high-energy mission, the electric propulsion provides less consumption of propellant or more payload mass under a given mass constraint of the satellite and the scientific probe. The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) has been developing a variety of electric propulsions for 30 years. These continuing efforts are now turning out to be an application era for the propulsion systems for near-Earth and/or interplanetary transportation of space probes with scientific missions in the 21st century. A magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) arcjet successfully finished its space test onboard the Space Flyer Unit (SFU), a microwave ion engine is being developed for the asteroid sample return mission, and a DC arcjet is ready to be used for future orbit transfer or attitude control of Earth-bound satellites. The electric propulsions are divided into three major groups according to their plasma acceleration principles, electromagnetic, electrostatic and electrothermal devices. In ISAS, all the types of electric propulsions are studied as the high AV mission enablers and in this report these accomplishments and future prospects are introduced. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Design of a fusion propulsion system - Part 1: Gigawatt-level
   magnetoplasmadynamic source
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB Optimum travel duration for manned interplanetary missions requires propulsion systems that deliver very high thrust, on the order of a thousand Newtons, in conjunction with specific impulse capabilities that exceed 10,000 s. Theoretically, rocket propellants consisting of fusion reactants intermixed with large masses of low-molecular-weight fuels can be expanded within a magnetic nozzle to meet these requirements. To produce the power levels associated with such systems, a gigawatt pulse line called Godzilla is adapted for experimental development. The megajoule-level energy available is electromagnetically deposited in cold helium gas to simulate the fusion-heated, low-molecular-weight propellant. The magnetohydrodynamic computer code, MACH2, is employed to provide guidelines in the design of this magnetoplasmadynamic plasma source. The numerical results specify the geometric configuration and operation conditions required to overcome destructive effects associated with these power levels within experimental limitations.

AB The paper presents the results of the definition studies performed for the European Space Agency (ESA) on system architectures and enabling technologies for "BepiColombo", a Cornerstone class mission to be launched in the 2007-2009 time frame. The scientific mission comprises 1-year observations by a Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), dedicated to remote sensing, and a Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), dedicated to particles and fields, plus short-duration in situ analysis by a Mercury surface element (MSE). A flexible approach to the programme has been developed, comprising two alternative launch scenarios. In the first option (2009), the 2500-kg class satellite composite, including two propulsion modules and three scientific modules, is launched by an Ariane-5. The trajectory design is based on Venus and Mercury gravity assists plus the thrust provided by a Solar Electric Propulsion Module (SEPM), that is jettisoned before being captured into Mercury orbit. Capture and orbit insertion, executed by successive manoeuvres. of a Chemical Propulsion Module (CPM), occur less than 2.5 yr
