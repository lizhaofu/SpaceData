AB While conducting research examining the impact of American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) on the aquaculture industry in the southeastern United States, an apparent age and sex bias was observed among captured and collected pelicans. Data from 284 pelicans captured or collected at loafing sites located near aquaculture ponds during 1998 to 2009 were analyzed. A sampling bias could suggest segregation of pelicans by sex or age on wintering grounds. Captured pelicans were strongly biased towards immature males (73%) and collected pelicans were male biased (38% Adult Male, 47% Immature Male). Although the underlying mechanisms are not understood, observed pelican use of loafing areas may be related to numerous, readily available prey at aquaculture facilities.

AB In this study, we evaluated the structural integrity and weight of a rocket motor with a torispherical dome by size optimal design. Size optimal design was achieved by first-order and sub-problem methods, using the Ansys Parametric Design Language (APDL). For rapid design verification, a modified 2D axisymmetric finite-element model was used, and the bolt pre-tension load was expressed as function of the ratio of the cross-sectional area. The thickness of the dome and the cylindrical part of the rocket motor were selected as the design parameters. Our results showed that the weight and structural integrity of the rocket motor at the initial design stage could be determined more rapidly and accurately with the modified 2D axisymmetric finite-element model than with the 3D finite-element model. Further, the weight of the rocket motor could be saved to maximum of 17.6% within safety limit.

AB Introduction: Each malignant neoplasm can lead towards the initiation of the acute phase reaction. A special form of the acute phase reaction is the coordinated synthesis of several proteins. Quantitative acute phase protein (APP) changes observed during the neoplastic process remain unclear. They can result from the development of immunosuppression connected with the production of immunosuppressive cytokines by the tumor. The research on the role of cytokines and acute phase proteins as prognostic factors, following surgical management of malignant tumors is scarce, and the results are ambiguous.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the quantitive changes of the APP serum level in patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent a radical resection. We analysed the correlations between the quantitive changes of APP and: age, gender, the histological type of cancer, T stage, N stage and grading.
   Material and methods: We analysed a group of 192 patients surgically treated for NSCLC from 2008 to 2009. The study group consisted of 144 male and 48 female patients, aged between 38 and 79 years (average: 62.9 yrs). The most frequent histological types of cancer were: the squamous cell lung cancer (88 patients) and the adenocarcinoma (71 patients). The majority of them were in stage I B (52 patients) and III A (39 patients). We analysed serum levels of: C-reactive protein (CRP), alfa 1 acid glicoprotein (AGP), alfa 1 antitrypsin (AT), and haptoglobin (Hp) using the method of rocket immunoelectroforesis by Laurell. Statistical analysis was based on the Statistica 8.0 software.
   Results: We didn't find any significant differences between APP levels and age, but all APP levels were significantly higher in male patients. The CRP and AT levels correlated with grading and were higher in G2 and G3 tumors. The serum levels of CRP and Hp were significantly higher in patients with squamous cell lung cancer compared to other histological types. The levels all of four APP were significantly higher in the group of patients with T3 or T4 category, while the patients with N1 or N2 status had significantly higher concentrations of CRP and Hp. We observed a positive correlation between serum levels all of APP and TNM stage.
   Conclusions: The serum concentration of selected APP may correlate with more aggressive clinical behaviour of lung cancer. The patients with N1 or N2 stage of the squamous cell lung cancer have significantly higher serum level of CRP and Hp. The preoperative concentration all of APP correlates with TNM stage. These proteins could serve as prognostic factors in the risk assessment of the cancer recurrence after the surgical management.

AB Fracture toughness of the weld joints of the maraging steel rocket motor case obtained from the limited Compact Tension (CT) specimens are found to be invalid due to the measured crack lengths through the thickness of the specimens exceeding 10% of the initial crack length. This paper proposes an indirect method to evaluate the pre-crack length of the CT specimen from the recorded load versus crack mouth opening displacement data. The Chauvenet's criterion is applied. After confirming the initial crack size and other validity conditions, the evaluated fracture toughness is designated as the plane-strain fracture toughness (K(IC)). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aimed to evaluate the effects of aluminum in nutrient solution on growth of Eruca plants (Eruca sativa Mill.) under controlled conditions. We used aluminum trichloride, AlCl(3), and the treatments: 0.0, 15.0, 30.0, 45.0 and 60.0 mg Al(3) + L(-1) solution. Eruca seeds were distributed phenolic foam which received distilled water for 10 days after sowing (DAS) and after this period the seedlings were transferred to plastic pots capacity of 2 kg washed sand and sieved. The omission of aluminum (Al(3+) 0.0 mg L(-1)) the pH was adjusted to 6.0. The experiment was divided into three stages: 1) from 11 to the 14 DAS, the plants were irrigated with a solution diluted 50% (pH 6.0), 2) from 15 to 28 DAS, plants were irrigated with complete solution modified with phosphorus at a concentration of 3.1 mg L(-1) (pH 6.0), 3) from 29 to the 45 DAS, the plants were treated with aluminum in the complete nutrient solution, modified with phosphorus concentration of 3,1 mg L(-1) and pH adjusted to 4.2. At 45 DAS were evaluated: number of leaves, shoot length, root and total, dry mass of roots, stems and total leaf area as well. A completely randomized design with five replicates and the data submitted to analysis of variance and polynomial regression study. Plant growth rocket is significantly reduced in the presence of aluminum (AlCl(3)) under conditions.of.nutrient. solution.

TI A modular assembly method of a feed and thruster system for Cubesats
SO JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB A modular assembly method for devices based on micro system technology is presented. The assembly method forms the foundation for a miniaturized feed and thruster system as part of a micro propulsion unit working as a simple blow-down system of a rocket engine. The micro rocket is designed to be used for constellation maintenance of Cubesats, which measure 10 x 10 x 10 cm and have a mass less than 1 kg. The feed and thruster system contains an active valve, control electronics, a particle filter and an axisymmetric converging-diverging nozzle, all fabricated as separate modules. A novel method is used to integrate these modules by placing them on or in a glass tube package. The assembly method is shown to be a valid method but the valve module needs to be improved considerably.

ID ATOMIZATION; JET
AB In this work, the author would like to portray a sketch of a fluid dynamical picture to describe the coupling nature/strength between the chamber acoustics and the injectors. This new perspective is achieved through a physically intuitive argument combined with previously published test results for two popular injector designs, namely, coaxial and impinging jets. For the impinging jet injectors, it is shown that the dynamic behavior of the dark-core (or breakup) zone for each jet, their lengths and thicknesses, has a profound impact on injector sensitivity to disturbances in its surrounding. This information is used to offer a possible explanation for the trends seen on the Hewitt stability plot in impinging jet injectors.

AB In spacecraft, severe vibrations induced by the launch vehicle may cause damage to the precision payload. Therefore active adapters with vibration suspending characteristics are needed. This paper presents theoretical studies of the active vibration control characteristics of conical shells with laminated piezoelectric actuators. A diagonal piezoelectric actuator is proposed to control the axial, lateral and transverse vibrations of the conical shell. Modal functions are designed to represent the free vibrations of the conical shell with clamped-free boundary conditions. General formulae of the modal control force and corresponding components are derived based on the converse piezoelectric effects and then specified for the diagonal actuators. By using an open-loop control method, the modal control characteristics of diagonal actuator segments at different locations are investigated and compared, and the axial, lateral and transverse vibrations of two conical shell models are evaluated. The optimal locations of actuator segments for the control of different natural modes are also investigated.

TI Detection of Water in the LCROSS Ejecta Plume

ID LUNAR; SURFACE; MOON; ICE
AB Several remote observations have indicated that water ice may be presented in permanently shadowed craters of the Moon. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission was designed to provide direct evidence (1). On 9 October 2009, a spent Centaur rocket struck the persistently shadowed region within the lunar south pole crater Cabeus, ejecting debris, dust, and vapor. This material was observed by a second "shepherding" spacecraft, which carried nine instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a radiometer. Near-infrared absorbance attributed to water vapor and ice and ultraviolet emissions attributable to hydroxyl radicals support the presence of water in the debris. The maximum total water vapor and water ice within the instrument field of view was 155 +/- 12 kilograms. Given the estimated total excavated mass of regolith that reached sunlight, and hence was observable, the concentration of water ice in the regolith at the LCROSS impact site is estimated to be 5.6 +/- 2.9% by mass. In addition to water, spectral bands of a number of other volatile compounds were observed, including light hydrocarbons, sulfur-bearing species, and carbon dioxide.

AB Aerospace, aviation particularly, need, in any era, the strongest and most thermostable materials available, often at nearly any price. The space elevator, space ships (especially during atmospheric reentry), rocket combustion chambers, thermally challenged engine surfaces, hypersonic aircraft materials are better now than any available, with undreamed performance as the reward if obtained. As shown in this research, the offered new material allows to greatly improve all characteristics of space ships, rockets, engines, and aircraft, and design new types space, propulsion, and aviation systems. At present the term "nanotechnology" is well known-in its ideal form, the flawless and completely controlled design of conventional molecular matter from molecules or atoms. Such power over nature would offer routine achievement of remarkable properties in conventional matter, and creation of metamaterials where the structure not the composition brings forth new powers of matter. But even this yet unachieved goal is not the end in material science possibilities. The writer herein offers the idea of design of new forms of nuclear matter from nucleons (neutrons, protons), electrons, and other nuclear particles. He shows this new "AB Matter" has extraordinary properties (for example, tensile strength, stiffness, hardness, critical temperature, superconductivity, supertransparency, zero friction, etc.), which are up to millions of times better than corresponding properties of conventional molecular matter. He shows concepts of design for space ships, rockets, aircraft, sea ships, transportation, thermonuclear reactors, constructions, and so on from nuclear matter. These vehicles will have unbelievable possibilities (e.g., invisibility, ghostlike penetration through any walls and armor, protection from nuclear bomb explosions and any radiation flux, etc.). People may think this as fantasy. But 15 years ago most people and many scientists thought nanotechnology was fantasy. Now many groups and industrial laboratories, even start-ups, spend hundreds of millions of dollars for development of nanotechnological-range products (precise chemistry, patterned atoms, catalysts, metamaterials, etc.) and we have nanotubes (a new material which does not exist in nature) and other achievements are beginning to come out of the pipeline in prospect. Nanotubes are stronger than steel by a hundred times-surely an amazement to a 19th century observer if he could behold them. Nanotechnology, in near term prospect, operates with objects (molecules and atoms) having the size in nanometer (10(-9) m). The writer here outlines perhaps more distant operations with objects (nuclei) having the size in the femtometer range (10(-15) m, millions of times smaller than the nanometer scale). The name of this new technology is femtotechnology.

AB Satellite launch vehicle design lies at the cross-road of multiple challenging technologies and its design and optimization presents a typical example of multidisciplinary design and optimization process. The complexity of problem demands for highly efficient and effective algorithm that can optimize the design. This research effort aims to evaluate and compare three modern heuristic optimization methods for multidisciplinary design and optimization of air launched satellite launch vehicle. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of solutions presented the robustness of solution of these methods under parametric uncertainty. The Monte Carlo simulation method conducted the sensitivity analysis of the solutions. Heuristic optimization methods evaluated for current research include genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing. Genetic algorithm has been the most popular choice of designers for satellite launch vehicles. Application of other two methods in design and optimization of satellite launch vehicles is rare and thus become the motivational ingredient for the present research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Large structural problems with high precision and complexity require a high-performance computation using the efficient parallel algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to present the parallel performance of thermal-structural coupled analysis tested on a parallel cluster system. In the coupled analysis, the heat transfer analysis is carried out, and then the structural analysis is performed based on temperature distribution. For the automatic and efficient connection of two parallel analysis modules, the several communication patterns were studied. The parallel performance was demonstrated for the sample and the real application problems, such as a laminated composite material by the DNS(Direct Numerical Simulation) approach and an aerospace launch vehicle model.

AB In light of the significant changes being observed in the US space industry, in terms of the increase share of commercial launches, the development of inland spaceports, and the emergence of new vehicle designs and propulsion systems, there is need to reassess launch safety. In this paper, several issues related to space launch safety are reviewed, one in particular being the use, as the main the safety metric, of the mean collective risk to the general public, also known as the expectation of casualties. A new, decision level, information-fusion-based metric is proposed, and through a detailed case study, its merit in terms of the quality and quantity of information it generates is illustrated. The need for a new metric is here advocated as a critical first step toward the necessary transition from a risk avoidance philosophy to space launch safety to a risk management philosophy.

ID SHUTTLE ENTRY GUIDANCE
AB Using the recently developed model predictive static programming (MPSP) technique, a nonlinear suboptimal reentry guidance scheme is presented in this paper for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV). Unlike traditional RLV guidance, the problem considered over here is restricted only to pitch plane maneuver of the vehicle, which allows simpler mission planning and vehicle load management. The computationally efficient MPSP technique brings in the philosophy of trajectory optimization into the framework of guidance design, which in turn results in very effective guidance schemes in general. In the problem addressed in this paper, it successfully guides the RLV through the critical reentry phase both by constraining it to the allowable narrow flight corridor as well as by meeting the terminal constraints at the end of the reentry segment. The guidance design is validated by considering possible aerodynamic uncertainties as well as dispersions in the initial conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

   laboratory and related benchmarks of performance

   Emissions; Particulate matter; Water Boiling Test
AB Improved cooking stove projects in the developing world have the potential to reduce deforestation, improve health, and slow climate change. To meet these requirements, stoves must be carefully designed through thorough testing and verification of performance. The systematic investigation of the heat transfer and combustion efficiency of stove design in the laboratory sheds light on what technologies work best and helps to ensure that stoves being disseminated are truly a significant improvement over traditional cooking methods.
   Performance of 50 different stove designs was investigated using the 2003 University of California-Berkeley (UCB) revised Water Boiling Test (WBT) Version 3.0 to compare the fuel use, carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions produced. While these laboratory tests do not necessarily predict field performance for actual cooking, the elimination of variables such as fuel, tending, and moisture content, helps to isolate and compare the technical properties of stove design. Stoves tested fell under 7 main categories: simple stoves without combustion chambers, stoves with rocket-type combustion chambers, gasifier stoves, fan-assisted stoves, charcoal-burning stoves, liquid/gas fuel stoves, and wood-burning stoves with chimneys. A carefully made three-stone fire was also tested for comparison. Results showed that:
   Stoves without well-designed combustion chambers may reduce fuel use in comparison to the three-stone fire but do not necessarily decrease and can potentially increase emissions of CO and PM.
   Rocket-type stoves can reduce fuel use by 33%, CO emissions by 75%, and PM emissions by 46% on average in comparison to the three-stone fire.
   Use of a pot skirt can reduce fuel use and emissions by 25-30%.
   When operating well, gasifier stoves can reduce particulate matter substantially, averaging 90% improvement over the three-stone fire.
   Five forced air stoves reduced fuel use by an average of 40% and emissions by 90% over the three-stone fire.
   Traditional charcoal stoves use about the same amount of energy as the three-stone fire to complete a task (not counting the energy lost in making the charcoal, which can be as much as 70%) and produce up to two times more carbon monoxide and 80% less PM. A rocket-type charcoal stove can reduce this energy consumption by one third and CO emission by at least one half.
   Liquid fuels generally exhibit less energy use and emissions. Kerosene can emit higher levels of PM than some improved wood stoves when not operating properly.
   Well-designed stoves with chimneys remove smoke from the kitchen while fuel use is generally directly related to how much of the pot is in direct contact with the flames.
   From this data, it was possible to recommend benchmarks of improved cookstove performance. Benchmarks were suggested at levels that were achievable using known materials and manufacturing techniques, yet still aspirational, ensuring each stove design is carefully tested and optimized for highest efficiencies. It is hoped that these benchmarks can be used as the first step toward international performance standards for cooking stoves. Five of the stoves presented here were also tested at the US EPA, with results agreeing within 20% or better on all fuel and emissions measures, suggesting standard evaluation at various locations is possible.

DE Biomass; Cookstove; Testing; Household; Cooking; Carbon emissions
AB This paper presents the results of two studies conducted to evaluate the performance and usability of household biomass cookstoves under field conditions in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Cooking tests and qualitative surveys compared improved, manufactured stove models based on the 'rocket' design with the traditional three-stone fire. All tests and interviews took place in household kitchens in two village areas in Western Uganda and Western Tanzania. The performance parameters evaluated in cooking tests were specific fuelwood consumption and cooking time. Surveying of household cooks gathered information about prevailing cooking practices, stove preference and usability, and willingness to pay for novel stove types. Test results showed that the manufactured stoves, in general, yield a substantial reduction in specific fuelwood consumption relative to the three-stone fire, with results varying by stove type and type of food cooked. Survey data suggests that while cooks recognize fuelwood savings as an important benefit, overall stove preference depends upon a combination of this and other factors, including cooking time, stove size and ease of use. These findings highlight the importance of testing multiple cookstoves for preparation of a variety of food items, as well as combined use of quantitative stove tests in combination with qualitative surveys in efforts to determine suitability of cookstoves for household use in a given community.

AB Cooking tests were conducted in randomly selected school kitchens in the Sauri Millennium Villages Project site, located in Siaya District of Nyanza Province in Western Kenya. The tests compared fuel consumption measurements obtained using a traditional three-stone fire with those from newly introduced institutional stoves based on the "rocket" design. The key metric used was Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), defined as the weight of firewood consumed in cooking a single batch of food divided by the total weight of food, measured after cooking. Tests followed the normal cooking practices in the school kitchens and included the typical range of foods prepared for midday school meals programs. The study included two types of tests: paired tests, in which most conditions were controlled between one test conducted on a three-stone fire and a matching test conducted on a "rocket" stove; and unpaired tests, in which conditions were similar, but not strictly controlled, among two large sets of relatively independent three-stone fire and rocket stove tests. Results from both paired and unpaired experiments, averaged across all types of food cooked, showed that the use of rocket stoves yielded significantly lower SFC values without prolonging cooking time when compared with three-stone fires. An analysis comparing results from paired and unpaired cooking tests suggests that, due to high variance and sources of bias in unpaired tests, experimental design should favor paired tests.

AB This work investigates the effect of degree of cutting on atmosphere composition as well as on metabolic activity (CO(2) and ethylene production), color and some nutritional parameters of rocket leaves subjected to storage at 8C for 7 and 14 days under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Harvested leaves were trimmed at the point that lamina starts and then they were used without further processing (intact), or after cutting into two (half) or four (quarter) similar parts, vertically to the midrib. The results showed that degree of cutting did not affect the metabolic activity of rocket leaves (CO(2) and ethylene production), but storage duration did. This resulted in non-significant differences in atmosphere composition (CO(2) and ethylene concentration) of the packages containing leaves of different degree of cutting as well as on color and some nutritional parameters of rocket leaves. These results suggest that storage duration is more critical than the degree of cutting and it should be considered for application to MAP design for the rocket leaves.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   Rocket is usually marketed as fresh-cut in modified atmosphere packages (MAPs) either alone or in a mixture with other leafy vegetables. Important response of tissues to wounding, induced during the preparation of fresh-cut produce, is the increase of CO(2) and ethylene production, affecting its perishability. The intensity of the wounding response is proportional to the extent of wounding. However, the effect of degree of cutting of rocket leaves on the metabolic activity as well as on the quality is still unresolved. The increase of ethylene production as a wounding response, if any, could have a detrimental effect on the color of minimally processed rocket leaves stored under MAP. This work investigates the effect of degree of cutting and storage duration on atmosphere composition as well as on metabolic activity, color and some nutritional parameters of rocket leaves stored under MAP, which can be useful for application to MAP design for this product.

TI High-Performance Rocket Nozzle Concept
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB An innovative technical solution that overcomes the limitation induced by flow separation phenomena and allows increasing the vacuum-specific impulse of a main stage rocket engine is presented. After reviewing the open technical literature on flow separation and advance nozzles design, the newly proposed concept is extensively presented. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analyses and experimental results (cold gas subscale models) demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple device, adaptable to any bell-shaped nozzle and which provides a solution to the flow separation issue, while increasing vacuum-specific impulse performances for booster and main stage engines. Moreover, this new concept gives rise to a wider engine-throttling range, even at low altitude, without incurring flow separation and associated side loads. Experimental data show a potential for favorable behavior even during transient phases, allowing significant reduction on transient side-loads activity. Finally, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics computations have been extended to the hot tiring case (chemically reactive hydrogen/oxygen propellants), both in steady-state and transient conditions. The results show the suitability of the proposed concept for application to real rocket engines.

AB A numerical code that simulates combustion phenomena occurring in a solid rocket motor is developed in this study using a preconditioning algorithm. A quasi-steady-combustion process was analyzed for a composite material in a submerged nozzle. The governing equations were solved using a dual-time stepping method combined with a finite volume method. The mass flux and pressure in the cell face were evaluated using the advective upwind splitting method scheme. The turbulence model uses a two-equation model combined with a turbulence closure model. The geometric conservation law is used to simulate transient propellant surface regression. The numerical results for solid rocket combustion were compared with experimental results with a composite propellant. The calculated pressure variation in the combustion chamber is in good agreement with the measured results.

AB Obtaining the admittance function for propellants is an important part of combustion instability analysis. However, obtaining an admittance function is an expensive process. The T-burner is the industry standard method for characterizing acoustic response of solid propellants. This device is expensive to maintain and operate due to large test matrices required to quantify the response for a single propellant. To reduce costs, a method was developed for obtaining admittance functions from a pulsed tubular grain. This method allows for several modes to be evaluated simultaneously and in so doing reduces the total number of tests. A reusable tubular grain motor that can be pulse tested was designed. Two methods were used to evaluate the data, namely Culick's nonlinear gas dynamics method and Flandro's energy balance method. These methods returned similar results. Linear analysis (as developed by Flandro and coworkers) was performed. A baseline propellant was first evaluated, three motors with 1% SiC as a stability additive, and two motors with 4% Al. Good agreement was found between the two methods. The SiC, which is not a common additive, was found to greatly increase the stability of the motor. One tubular pulsed test has the potential to replace at least 15 T-burner tests.

AB A method fir augmenting the thrust of a solid rocket motor by coupling beamed microwave energy to alumina particles in the diverging section of a nozzle is analyzed. Coupling of microwave radiation with micron-sized alumina particles increases the particle temperature. The main mechanism of thrust increase is expected to be gas particle collisions that transfer the increased energy of particles to kinetic energy of the expanding gas. A dynamic power-generation and beaming scheme has been designed to produce 1.0 GW of power at a launch vehicle throughout the first 50 km of its ascent trajectory. Microwave coupling to alumina particles has been investigated experimentally. A two-phase, two-way coupled numerical model has also been developed to assess the increase in propulsive performance. The developed numerical capability has been used to calculate nozzle flowfields for two different solid rocket motors with and without the addition of beamed microwave radiation. High gas density and fast collisional relaxation result in the efficient transfer of microwave energy to the kinetic energy of the flow. The total thrust in both cases was found to increase by approximately 0.5% for a 100 MV/m(2) microwave beam and by 6% for a 1 GW/m(2) beam.

AB Numerical simulations and experiments were conducted to analyze the dynamic characteristics of a newly developed bellows-type stabilizer, which maintains a steady propellant mixture ratio in the gas generator of a liquid rocket engine. A nonlinear mathematical model of the stabilizer and a linear version of the model were developed. The dynamic characteristics predicted by the linear model showed good agreement with experimental results, thus proving the validity of the model. It was found through sensitivity analyses that the main design parameters affecting the dynamic characteristics of the stabilizer system are the orifice diameter and the length of the pilot line.

TI Vibration-based Damage Detection to the Composite Tank Filled with Fluid

ID LAUNCH-VEHICLE; IDENTIFICATION
AB Demand of composite fuel tank for space vehicles keeps increasing globally in the aerospace industry, and requires of a mean to detect the structural damage or predict its service life. As important and valid tools, in the past years, lots of nondestructive evaluation techniques have been developed, and they are carried out according to a regular time schedule. The structure has to be taken out of service during each inspection, causing serious financial implications for the user. That is why much research effort is now focused on real-time monitoring techniques. Optical grating fiber attracts more and more attention due to its excellent sensing and mechanical performances and ability of monitoring online. But it still can only measure the local deformation, but not the damage that is far away from the location of optical fiber sensors. Statistical model-based vibration-based monitoring methods have proved to be useful for the detection and localization of structural damages which might occur far from the location of the sensors. An experimental investigation on the modal properties and dynamic response of composite fuel tank filled with fluid under external excitation in the transverse direction are reported, and a vibration signal, which was obtained when the composite fuel tank filled with water was under impulsion until it failed. Proposed in this study is a method to detect the damage of the composite fuel tank with the scarce gradual damaged vibration signal. The experiment setup is also described in detail with inclusion of modeling a damaged situation of a structure. The damage detection algorithm is developed by applying a residually generated form of a subspace-based covariance-driven identification method and the vibration signal analysis. Results of the modal identification and the damage detection are reported in this article.

AB It is well known that the dynamic performance of a rocket or launch vehicle is enhanced when the length of the divergent section of its nozzle is reduced or the nozzle exit area ratio is increased. However, there exists a significant performance trade-off in such rocket nozzle designs due to the presence of random side loads under overexpanded nozzle-operating conditions. Flow separation and the associated side-load phenomena have been extensively investigated over the past five decades; however, not much has been reported on the effect of side loads on the attitude dynamics of rocket or launch vehicle. This paper presents a quantitative investigation on the influence of in-nozzle random side loads on the attitude dynamics of a launch vehicle. The attitude dynamics of launch vehicle motion is captured using variable-mass control-volume formulation on a cylindrical rigid sounding rocket model. A novel physics-based stochastic model of nozzle side-load force is developed and embedded in the rigid-body model of rocket. The mathematical model, computational scheme, and results corresponding to side loading scenario are subsequently discussed. The results highlight the influence of in-nozzle random side loads on the roll, pitch, yaw, and translational dynamics of a rigid-body rocket model. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

DE Pulse detonation rocket engine; Performance; Constant volume cycle;
   Specific impulse
AB As the propagation time of detonation is very short in the actual operation process of a pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE), the gases expelled slightly from the detonation chamber in this process is negligible. Therefore, a mathematical model of constant volume cycle (CVC) can be used to approximately depict the operation process of PDRE. Based on CVC model, a systematic analysis of PDRE's performance is conducted in this paper. Combined CVC model with Chemical Equilibrium and Applications (CEA) code, the specific impulse of PDRE using different propellants could be obtained. Utilizing this model, the specific impulse of kerosene/oxygen PDRE in vacuum and at finite backpressures is estimated. When the backpressure exists, there is an optimum nozzle area expansion ratio in the nozzle design of PDRE, similar to conventional steady-state rocket. The performance of PDRE and conventional steady rocket is compared respectively, under the two conditions of the same supply system and the same maximum material stress. When PDRE and conventional steady rocket have a comparable performance, the filling pressure of PDRE is much lower than that of steady rocket. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Upper stage solid rocket motors (SRMS) for launch vehicles require a highly efficient propulsion system. Grain design proves to be vital in terms of minimizing inert mass by adopting a high volumetric efficiency with minimum possible sliver. In this article, a methodology has been presented for designing three-dimensional (3D) grain configuration of radial slot for upper stage solid rocket motors. The design process involves parametric modeling of the geometry in computer aided design (CAD) software through dynamic variables that define the complex configuration. Grain burn back is achieved by making new surfaces at each web increment and calculating geometrical properties at each step. Geometrical calculations are based on volume and change-in-volume calculations. Equilibrium pressure method is used to calculate the internal ballistics. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been used as the optimizer because of its robustness and efficient capacity to explore the design space for global optimum solution and eliminate the requirement of an initial guess. Average thrust maximization under design constraints is the objective function.

AB Because of the complexities involved in measuring and modeling the performance and properties of finished fuels, the fuel science community must often use surrogate mixtures as substitutes, especially in the absence of consensus standard mixtures. While surrogate mixtures are often formulated on the basis of the ability of a particular mixture to reproduce a particular property, there is usually a desire to employ surrogate mixtures that are physicochemically authentic. This means that, provided that the primary purpose is satisfied, researchers are inclined to choose mixtures that have physical and chemical properties appropriate to the finished fuel. In this paper, we apply the advanced distillation curve method as a means to evaluate the physicochemical authenticity of surrogate mixtures. While the strategy outlined here can be used for any family of surrogates, we apply it to surrogate mixtures for Jet-A/JP-8. Mixtures were divided into two groups: (1) simple surrogate mixtures with up to three components and (2) complex surrogate mixtures with more than three components. We found that the modified Aachen surrogate (among the simple fluids) and the Schultz surrogate (among the complex fluids) had the best physicochemical authenticity.

DE Langmuir probe; electron density; ionosphere
AB The main goal of this work was to develop a Langmuir probe instrument for sounding rockets capable of performing high-speed absolute electron density measurements, and thereby be able to detect sub-meter ionospheric plasma density structures. The system comprises four cylindrical probes with a diameter of 0.51 mm and a length of 25 mm, each operated at a different fixed bias voltage in the electron saturation region. The probe diameter was chosen significantly less than the Debye shielding length to avoid complex sheath effects but large enough to ensure a probe area sufficiently large to accurately measure the electron currents drawn by the probes (in the range 1 nA to 1 mu A). The crucial feature of the University of Oslo's multi-needle Langmuir probe (m-NLP) is that it is possible to determine the electron density without the need to know the spacecraft potential and the electron temperature T-e. The m-NLP instrument covers a density range from n(e) = 10(9) m(-3) to 10(12) m(-3), with sampling rates up to 9 kHz. The m-NLP instrument was successfully tested on the ICI-2 (Investigation of Cusp Irregularities) sounding rocket flight from Svalbard on 5 December 2008.

AB Solid locket propellants are modeled as Maxwell Fluid with single spring and single dashpot in series Complete stress-strain curve is generated for case-bonded composite propellant formulations by taking suitable values of spring constant and damping coefficient Propellants from same lot are tested at different strain rate It is observed that change in spring constant, representing elastic part is very small with strain rate but damping constant varies significantly with variation in strain rate For a typical propellant formulation, when strain rate is varied from 0 00037 to 0 185 per second. spring constant (K) changed nom 5 5 to 7 9 M Pa. but damping coefficient (D) varied from 1400 to 4 M Pas For all strain rates, stress-strain curve is genetated using developed Maxwell model and close matching with actual test curve is observed This indicates validity of Maxwell fluid model for case-bonded solid propellant formulations It is observed that with increases in strain rate, spring constant increases but damping coefficient decreases representing solid rocket propellant as a title viscoelastic material It is also established that at higher strian rate. damping coefficient becomes negligible as compared to spring constant It is also observed that variation of spring constant is logarithmic with strain rate and that of damping coefficient follows cl power law The correlation coefficients are introduced to ascertain swing, constants and clamping coefficients at ally strain rate from that at a reference strain rate Correlation for spring constant needs a coefficient "H" which is function of propellant formulation alone and not of test conditions and the equation developed is K(2) = (K(1)-H) x {In(d epsilon(2)/(dt)/In(d epsilon(1)/dt)} + H Similarly lot damping coefficient (D) also another constant "S" is introduced and prediction formula is given by D(2) = D(1) x {(d epsilon(2)/dt)/(d epsilon(1)/dt)} Evaluating constants "H" and "S" at different strain rates validate this mathematical formulation for different propellant formulations Close matching of test and predicted stress-strain cur ye indicates propellant behavior as viscoelastic Maxwell Fluid Uniqueness of approach is to pi edict complete stress-strain curves. which are not attempted by any other researchers

AB The coupling effects among lateral mode, longitudinal mode and torsional mode of a launch vehicle cannot be taken into account in traditional dynamic analysis using lateral beam model and longitudinal spring-mass model individually. To deal with the problem, propellant analogy methods based on beam model are proposed and coupled mass-matrix of liquid propellant is constructed through additional mass in the present study. Then an integrated model of launch vehicle for free vibration analysis is established, by which research on the interactions between longitudinal and lateral modes, longitudinal and torsional modes of the launch vehicle can be implemented. Numerical examples for tandem tanks validate the present method and its necessity.

AB A new automated multi-level of fidelity Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) methodology has been developed at the MDO Laboratory of K.N. Toosi University of Technology. This paper explains a new design approach by formulation of developed disciplinary modules. A conceptual design for a small, solid-propellant launch vehicle was considered at two levels of fidelity structure. Low and medium level of fidelity disciplinary codes were developed and linked. Appropriate design and analysis codes were defined according to their effect on the conceptual design process. Simultaneous optimization of the launch vehicle was performed at the discipline level and system level. Propulsion, aerodynamics, structure and trajectory disciplinary codes were used. To reach the minimum launch weight, the Low LoF code first searches the whole design space to achieve the mission requirements. Then the medium LoF code receives the output of the low LoF and gives a value near the optimum launch weight with more details and higher fidelity.

AB Taking inspiration from the orbital dynamics of dust, we find that spacecraft length scaling is a means of enabling infinite-impulse orbits that require no feedback control. Our candidate spacecraft is a 25 mu m thick, 1 cm square silicon chip equipped with signal transmitting circuitry. This design reduces the total mass to less than 7.5 mg and enables the spacecraft bus itself to serve as a solar sail with characteristic acceleration on the order of 0.1 mm/s(2). It is passive in that it maneuvers with no closed-loop actuation of orbital or attitude states. The unforced dynamics that result from an insertion orbit and a launch-vehicle separation determine its subsequent state evolution. We have developed a system architecture that uses solar radiation torques to maintain a sun-pointing heading and can be fabricated with standard microfabrication processes. This architecture has potential applications in heliocentric, geocentric, and three-body orbits. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Control over drop size distributions, injection rates, and geometrical distribution of fuel and oxidizer sprays in bi-propellant rocket engines has the potential to produce more efficient, more stable, less polluting rocket engines. This control also offers the potential of an engine that can be throttled, working efficiently over a wide range of output thrusts. Inkjet printing technologies, MEMS fuel atomizers, and piezoelectric injectors similar in concept to those used in diesel engines are considered for their potential to yield a new, more active injection scheme for a rocket engine. Inkjets are found to be unable to pump at sufficient pressures, and have possibly dangerous failure modes. Active injection is found to be feasible if high pressure drop along the injector plate is used. A conceptual design is presented and its basic behavior assessed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   rocket engine cooperation 40 years ago
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
DE Rocket engine; Man-rated; History; Astronautics
AB The Ludion was a French concept for a military one-man rocket-powered "hopper" aimed at giving troopers the ability to cross rivers or trenches. Sud Aviation was awarded in 1965 the development contract together with Bertin (for the jet pumps) and SEPR was to develop the rocket propulsion system. The propulsion system selected for the "Ludion" was based on the British extensive experience in handling and using isopropyl nitrate as a way of obtaining large amounts of gas able to drive jet engines at start. The idea was to use such a fluid as monopropellant for the propulsion system's gas generator. SEPR integrated this system with pipes and Bertin ejector nozzles and developed a thermally insulated generator able to fulfil all requirements. The main challenges laid in the successful integration of all components and the management of a multi-partners programme and in the design of a highly efficient thermal insulation protecting both generator and pilot from the intense heat generated by the thermal decomposition of isopropyl nitrate (used as a propellant). The first ground test of a Ludion with its rocket propulsion system took place on January 24, 1968, on the test airfield of Villaroche. After 59 tethered and five free flights, the programme was abandoned. It was deemed to be too impractical due to its size, the noise generated and changes in tactical considerations in favour of helicopters and amphibious transports. The first prototype is now displayed at the Paris Le Bourget Air & Space Museum. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A great challenge for the success of intercropping systems is the ability in determining which species should be used and, especially, the management of the cultivars or varieties to be associated. The objective of the present research was to evaluate the effect of the association of two cultivars of carrot (Daucus carota L.) with two cultivars of rocket (Eruca sativa M.) in two crops in strip-intercropping system and sole crops on the productive performance of these vegetables. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks in a 2x2+2 factorial with five replications. Treatments were the association of two carrot cultivars (Brasilia and Esplanada) with two rocket cultivars (Cultivada and Folha Larga) plus two additional treatments (two carrot cultivars or two rocket cultivars as sole crops in each block). The major results were: the rocket cultivars Cultivada and Folha Larga showed similar (p>0.05) productive performances in sole crop and intercropping system. The best performance (p <= 0.05) of the rocket was observed in the second cultivation. The carrot cultivar Brasilia showed the best productive performance (p <= 0.05) in both sole crop and intercropping system. The intercropped systems of carrot Brasilia + rocket Cultivada and carrot Brasilia + rocket Folha Larga were the best association based on agri-economic efficiency.

AB The HERSCHEL (helium resonant scattering in the corona and heliosphere) experiment is a rocket mission that was successfully launched last September from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, USA. HERSCHEL was conceived to investigate the solar corona in the extreme UV (EUV) and in the visible broadband polarized brightness and provided, for the first time, a global map of helium in the solar environment. The HERSCHEL payload consisted of a telescope, HERSCHEL EUV Imaging Telescope (HEIT), and two coronagraphs, HECOR (helium coronagraph) and SCORE (sounding coronagraph experiment). The SCORE instrument was designed and developed mainly by Italian research institutes and it is an imaging coronagraph to observe the solar corona from 1.4 to 4 solar radii. SCORE has two detectors for the EUV lines at 121.6 nm (HI) and 30.4 nm (HeII) and the visible broadband polarized brightness. The SCORE UV detector is an intensified CCD with a microchannel plate coupled to a CCD through a fiber-optic bundle. The SCORE visible light detector is a frame-transfer CCD coupled to a polarimeter based on a liquid crystal variable retarder plate. The SCORE coronagraph is described together with the performances of the cameras for imaging the solar corona.

ID ATTITUDE-CONTROL
AB Flexibility and aeroelastic behaviors in large space structures can lead to degradation of control system stability and performance. The model reference adaptive notch filter is an effective methodology used and implemented for reducing such effects. In this approach, designing a model reference for adaptive control algorithm in a flight device such as a launch vehicle is very important. In this way, the vibrations resulting from the structure flexibility mostly affects the pitch channel, and its influences on the yaw channel are negligible. This property is used and also the symmetrical behavior of the yaw and pitch channels. In this paper, by using this property and also the symmetrical behavior of the yaw and pitch channels, a new model reference using identification on the yaw channel is proposed. This model behaves very similar to the rigid body dynamic of the pitch channel and can be used as a model reference to control the vibrational effects. Simulation results illustrated applies the proposed algorithm and considerably reduces the vibrations in the pitch channel. Moreover, the main advantage of this new method is the online tuning of the model reference against unforeseen variations in the parameters of the rigid launch vehicle, which has not been considered in the previous works. Finally, robustness of the new control system in the presence of asymmetric behavior is investigated. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4001709]

AB This experimental research characterized the modes of combustion instability produced by an impinging-jet pentad injector burning in an open cylindrical chamber. The device is being explored as a laboratory analog for unsteady mixing processes in supercritical rocket injectors. The injector burned gaseous oxygen and gaseous methane at equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 2.0 and total mass flow rates from 0.33 to 4.9 grams per second. The radial position of the injector was also varied from 0 to 76% of the chamber radius. Six high-frequency pressure transducers located around the circumference and end of the chamber simultaneously recorded pressure fluctuations at each operating point. A detailed phase analysis among the transducers allowed determination of the modes of instability. Fast Fourier transforms determined the amplitude and frequency of the primary instability at each operating point. The results show that this single-element injector exhibits spontaneous first radial, first radial-first tangential, or second tangential modes at fluctuation amplitudes up to 17% of chamber pressure. Changing the radial location of the injector changed the operating points at which maximum instability occurred. The tangential instability modes occurred with only one injector element operating under the conditions described and therefore were not driven by injector-to-injector interactions.

AB Self-pressurizing propellant feed systems, due to their overall simplicity, offer attractive options for propulsion system designers. These systems inherently exhibit transient properties as the tank-fluid mass bleeds down, and modeling the two-phase blow-down or evacuation process using first-principle physics is an extremely complex and time-intensive problem. As an alternative, a simple engineering model is developed for self-pressurized saturated-propellant feed systems. The model assumes an adiabatic expansion for which, during evacuation, the current tank. fluid entropy and the fluid entropy that has escaped through the feed system equate to the initial tank-fluid entropy. Mass flow through the outlet orifice is modeled as a two-phase nonhomogeneous nonequilibrium process. The evacuated entropy is subtracted from the total entropy at the state of the fluid leaving the tank, then the new state with the existing mass and entropy is calculated using two-phase thermodynamic property tables. In this manner, the tank-fluid state is calculated continuously during the evacuation. This propellant feed-system evacuation model is developed using saturation fluid properties for nitrous oxide, but it is readily extensible to other saturated propellants. Model results are compared with data derived from cold-flow tests conducted on a small-scale hybrid rocket motor. The comparisons show excellent agreement.

AB We examined data on 117 return strokes in 31 rocket-and-wire-triggered lightning flashes acquired during experiments conducted from 1999 through 2004 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding, Florida, in order to compare the peak currents of the lightning return strokes with the corresponding charges transferred during various time intervals within 1 ms after return stroke initiation. We find that the determination coefficient (R-2) for lightning return stroke peak current versus the corresponding charge transfer decreases with increasing the duration of the charge transfer starting from return stroke onset. For example, R-2 = 0.91 for a charge transfer duration of 50 mu s after return stroke onset, R-2 = 0.83 for a charge transfer duration of 400 mu s, and R-2 = 0.77 for a charge transfer duration of 1 ms. Our results support the view that (1) the charge deposited on the lower portion of the leader channel determines the current peak and that (2) the charge transferred at later times is increasingly unrelated to both the current peak and the charge deposited on the lower channel section. Additionally, we find that the relation between triggered-lightning peak current and charge transfer to 50 mu s in Florida is essentially the same as that for subsequent strokes in natural lightning in Switzerland, further confirming the view that triggered-lightning strokes are very similar to subsequent strokes in natural lightning.

ID EQUATORIAL; REGION
AB We present here the first comparison of in situ ion density fluctuations measured by the Planar Langmuir Probe on Communication\Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) with coincident ground-based measurements of scintillation from the Scintillation Decision Aid (SCINDA) network and coherent scatter radar located on Christmas Island (3 degrees N, 157 degrees W) over a 15 month period from May 2008 through June 2009. The Planar Langmuir Probe on C/NOFS measures absolute ion densities from 10 to 10(8) cm(-3) at a rate up to 1024 Hz. The instrument is conceptually similar to ion traps and retarding potential analyzers that have flown on many past satellite and rocket missions. However, the present design includes advances in electronic capability compared with past designs. Initial results from this study show that in situ density fluctuations observed on magnetic flux tubes that pass over Christmas Island can be used as an indicator of ionospheric radio wave scintillation at that site. This is true even when the measurements are made at horizontal ranges of over 1000 km away from the ground site as long as the field line apex altitudes are less than similar to 600 km.

AB CD8+ T cells play important roles in clearing viral infections and eradicating tumors. Designing vaccines that elicit effective CD8+ T cell responses requires a thorough knowledge of the pathways of antigen presentation in vivo. Here, I review recent progress in understanding the activation of naive CD8+ T cells in vivo, with particular emphasis on cross-priming, the presentation of protein antigens acquired by dendritic cells from their environment. With the rapid advances in this area of research, the dawn of rational vaccine design is at hand.

AB CD8+ T cells play important roles in clearing viral infections and eradicating tumors. Designing vaccines that elicit effective CD8+ T cell responses requires a thorough knowledge of the pathways of antigen presentation in vivo. Here, I review recent progress in understanding the activation of naive CD8+ T cells in vivo, with particular emphasis on cross-priming, the presentation of protein antigens acquired by dendritic cells from their environment. With the rapid advances in this area of research, the dawn of rational vaccine design is at hand.

AB Currently, there is a desire to extend or enhance petroleum-derived diesel fuel with biodiesel fuel. Biodiesel fuel is a renewable, biomass-derived fluid that is biodegradable and nontoxic and can impart increased lubricity to petroleum-derived diesel fuels. In this paper, we analyze the properties of two biodiesel fuels produced from different feedstocks by use of the advanced distillation curve (ADC) method. The biodiesel fuels include a soybean-derived biodiesel fuel. SME, and a cuphea-derived biodiesel fuel, CME. Specifically, we present the thermodynamically consistent distillation curves and use the composition channel to characterize the curves in terms of composition and available energy content. This work provides a basis of comparison among these fuels in terms of the fundamental thermophysical properties. This comparison will be critical in determining the applicability and suitability of feedstocks designed for the production and manufacturing of biodiesel fuel to enhance or extend current petroleum-derived diesel fuels.

AB Understanding injector dynamics in the presence of strong pressure pulsations in Liquid Fueled Rocket Engines (LFRE) is important due to its strong association with the combustion instability phenomena. Lack of generators of strong periodical pulsations, particularly in the high frequency range, is problematic. To overcome this deficiency, a hydro-mechanical pulsator has been built to generate controlled periodic pressure oscillation, which simulates pressure pulsations in the feed lines of rocket motor injector systems. The present numerical analysis effort utilizes the unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach, to model the pulsating turbulent flow inside the hydro-mechanical pulsator as a preliminary design study to estimate optimum operating conditions for the proposed experimental study. Numerical results obtained from the study using sliding/deforming grids coupled with a two-layer low-Reynolds number RNG k-epsilon model indicated that the form of pulsation could be controlled based on the geometry of the orifices of the rotating valve in order to define its main parameters, and in the determination of the optimum geometry for obtaining a sinusoidal harmonic response. The results of the computations to evaluate the effect of varying mass flow rates to examine the influence of change in amplitude and phase characteristics of standard injectors on the boundaries, frequencies and amplitude of high frequency combustion instability are presented in the paper.

AB The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is one of the high performance electric propulsion devices for future interplanetary applications. Helicon sources can produce high-density plasmas with high-ionization efficiency suitable for VASIMR, which usually use two electromagnets to produce the required magnetic field configuration. How to optimal design the solenoids and how to create the requisite B-field are the key factors to affect the characteristics and performance of the helicon plasma. In this paper, the magnets were designed and fabricated, and an experimental helicon source was presented. Two solenoids situated around the cylindrical quartz tube were used to create an expanding magnetic field of about 250 G in the center decreasing to a few tens of Gauss in the downstream diffusion region. The antenna was powered by a radio-frequency (RF) system of 13.56 MHz, which maximum changeable power is 500 W. Our helicon device was installed with vacuum chamber that is pumped down to a base pressure of about 0.001 Pa using cryopumps. Langmuir probe is mounted on to measure the plasma parameters. It is found that, when increasing the radio-frequency power or varying the magnetic field, both the plasma density and operating mode of helicon-wave ion are also changed. Permanent magnets (PM) and High temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets are also considered to use in the helicon source, and relative analyses are discussed. The details of further research are to investigate the relationship that the applied magnets affect on the efficiency and performance of the helicon plasma.

AB The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is one of the high performance electric propulsion devices for future interplanetary applications. Helicon sources can produce high-density plasmas with high-ionization efficiency suitable for VASIMR, which usually use two electromagnets to produce the required magnetic field configuration. How to optimal design the solenoids and how to create the requisite B-field are the key factors to affect the characteristics and performance of the helicon plasma. In this paper, the magnets were designed and fabricated, and an experimental helicon source was presented. Two solenoids situated around the cylindrical quartz tube were used to create an expanding magnetic field of about 250 G in the center decreasing to a few tens of Gauss in the downstream diffusion region. The antenna was powered by a radio-frequency (RF) system of 13.56 MHz, which maximum changeable power is 500 W. Our helicon device was installed with vacuum chamber that is pumped down to a base pressure of about 0.001 Pa using cryopumps. Langmuir probe is mounted on to measure the plasma parameters. It is found that, when increasing the radio-frequency power or varying the magnetic field, both the plasma density and operating mode of helicon-wave ion are also changed. Permanent magnets (PM) and High temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets are also considered to use in the helicon source, and relative analyses are discussed. The details of further research are to investigate the relationship that the applied magnets affect on the efficiency and performance of the helicon plasma.

AB The mixed pixels are treated as noise or uncertainty in class allocation of a pixel and conventional hard classification algorithms may thus produce inaccurate classification outputs. Thus application of sub-pixel or soft classification methods have been adopted for classification of images acquired in complex and uncertain environment. The main objective of this research work has been to study the effect of feature dimensionality using statistical learning classifier - support vector machine (SVM with sigmoid kernel) while using different single and composite operators in fuzzy-based error matrixes generation. In this work mixed pixels have been used at allocation and testing stages and sub-pixel classification outputs have been evaluated using fuzzy-based error matrixes applying single and composite operators for generating matrix. As sub-pixel accuracy assessment were not available in commercial software, so in-house SMIC (Sub-pixel Multispectral Image Classifier) package has been used. Data used for this research work was from HySI sensor at 506 m spatial resolution from Indian Mini Satellite-1 (IMS-1) satellite launched on April 28, 2008 by Indian Space Research Organisation using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C9, acquired on 18(th) May 2008 for classification output and IRS-P6, AWIFS data for testing at sub-pixel reference data. The finding of this research illustrate that the uncertainty estimation at accuracy assessment stage can be carried while using single and composite operators and overall maximum accuracy was achieved while using 40 (13 to 52 bands) band data of HySI (IMS-1).

ID X-RAYS; MISSION
AB The Cute-1.7+APD II, 10 x 15 x 20 cm(3) in size and 5 kg in mass, is the third picosatellite developed by students at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. One of the primary goals of the Cute-1.7+APD II mission is to validate the use of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) as a radiation detector for the first time in a space experiment. While the mission itself is immature compared to the forefront satellites of space plasma physics, use of APDs offers various possibilities regarding a brand-new electron energy analyzer for medium-energy electrons and ions (1-100 keV), as well as a high-performance light sensor for the future X-ray astronomy missions. The satellite was successfully launched by ISRO PSLV-C9 rocket on 28 April 2008 and has since been in operation for more than a year. The Cute-1.7+APD II carries two reverse-type APDs to monitor the distribution of low-energy particles (mainly electrons and protons) down to 9.2 keV trapped in a low Earth orbit (LEO), including the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) as well as aurora bands. We present the design parameters and various preflight tests of the APDs prior to launch, particularly, the high counting response and active gain control system for the Cute-1.7+APD II mission. Examples of electron/proton distribution, obtained in continuous 12 h observations, will be presented to demonstrate the initial flight performance of the APDs in orbit.

AB Application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to the identification of security threats is a growing area of research. This work presents LIBS spectra of vapor-phase chemical warfare agent simulants and typical rocket fuels. A large dataset of spectra was acquired using a variety of gas mixtures and background pressures and processed using partial least squares analysis. The five compounds studied were identified with a 99% success rate by the best method. The temporal behavior of the emission lines as a function of chamber pressure and gas mixture was also investigated, revealing some interesting trends that merit further study.

AB In recent years, civilian and military users of aviation kerosene have been interested in expanding the scope of fuel feed stocks to include nonpetroleum sources. There are many reasons for this, the most important of which are the potential minimization of supply disruptions, the minimization of dependence on foreign sources of petroleum, the vulnerability of large centralized refineries, and the rising costs of current fuel streams. It is unlikely that a completely new, drop-in replacement fuel will be successful in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, however, the goal is to extend or enhance present petroleum-derived stocks. For this to be done on a rational basis, careful attention must be paid to fuel design parameters, one of the most important of which is the fluid volatility as expressed by the distillation curve. We have recently introduced several important improvements in the measurement of distillation curves of complex fluids. The modifications to the classical measurement provide for (1) a composition explicit data channel for each distillate fraction (for both qualitative and quantitative analysis); (2) temperature measurements that are true thermodynamic state points that can be modeled with an equation of state; (3) temperature, volume, and pressure measurements of low uncertainty suitable for equation of state development; (4) consistency with a century of historical data; (5) an assessment of the energy content of each distillate fraction; (6) trace chemical analysis of each distillate fraction; and (7) a corrosivity assessment of each distillate fraction. The composition explicit channel is achieved with a new sampling approach that allows precise qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of each fraction, on the fly. We have applied the new method to the measurement of rocket propellant, gasolines, jet fuels, and hydrocarbon crude oils. In this paper, we present the application of the technique to compare the characteristics of several new synthetic isoparaffinic kerosenes that are being used or tested as turbine fuels. These fuels include synthetics made from natural gas, coal, and waste greases.

AB This paper discusses design methods of solar sail transfer trajectories in Hill's restricted three-body problem. Based on the premise that the sail attitude is kept fixed with respect to the sunlight, the concepts of the general energy constant and solar sail invariant manifolds are proposed. The invariant manifolds are used to design transfer trajectories from Earth orbits to equilibrium points and trajectories between equilibrium points. Firstly, the general energy constant is employed to evaluate the energy requirement analytically for transfer trajectories from Earth orbits to equilibrium points. It is compared with a direct transfer using a rocket propellant as power source, and eventually the conclusion is reached that a velocity increment of hundreds of meters per second could be saved. For no-impulse transfer trajectories, active control and passive flying stage are incorporated to achieve transfer trajectories. The design problem is converted into a parameter optimization problem, and different objective functions are optimized for comparisons and analysis. The results of comparisons show that the total transfer time is insensitive to different objective functions. Finally, using the symmetry of the dynamical system, the invariant manifolds are patched to develop symmetrical transfer trajectories between symmetrical equilibrium points. Simulations are given for each case to validate the design method.

AB Few mutants conferring herbicide tolerance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L) have been developed Imazamox (2-[(RS)-4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl]-5-methoxymethylnicotinic acid) is a broad spectrum imidazolinone herbicide that could give growers a new tool to control many troublesome annual broadleaf and grass weeds Our objective was to identify imazamox tolerance in chemical mutation derived cotton lines Four imazamox tolerant mutant cotton (G hirsutum) genetic stocks, SCM(3)-4-3 (Reg No GS-3, PI 657941), SCM(3)-7-3 (Reg No GS-4, PI 657942), RM(3)-8-1 (Reg No GS-5, PI 657943), and EM(4)-3-1 (Reg No GS-6, PI 657944) were developed and jointly released by Texas Tech University, Department of Plant and Soil Science, and USDA-ARS Crop Genetics and Production Research Unit, Stoneville, MS, in July, 2009 These genetic stocks were obtained through ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of seeds of three High Plains cotton cultivars (SC 9023, Rocket, and Explorer) and selection with imazamox herbicide Application of five rates of imazamox (0, 88, 175, 350, and 700 g a (-1) ha(-1)) has shown that these mutants have elevated levels of tolerance to imazamox These genetic stocks are available for use by the cotton industry and public researchers to create hybrids, parental lines, or germplasm lines with resistance to the imazamox herbicide The identification of these mutants is expected to increase weed management options available to conventional growers who have become heavily dependent on glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] based crop production systems

AB A hybrid rocket is considered as the third stage of a three-stage launcher. The design of the hybrid rocket motor and the trajectory are simultaneously optimized by means of a nested direct/indirect procedure. Direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with indirect trajectory optimization to maximize the launcher payload for assigned characteristics of the first and second solid-propellant stages and final orbit. A mission profile based on the Vega launcher is considered. The feed system exploits a pressurizing gas, namely, helium, with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer and polyethylene as the fuel. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant oxidizer tank pressure. The optimization provides the optimal values of the main engine design parameters (pressurizing gas mass, nozzle expansion ratio, and initial values of tank pressure, mixture ratio, and thrust), the corresponding grain and engine geometry, and the control law (thrust direction during the ascent trajectory and engine switching times). Results show that a hybrid rocket may be a viable option for small launchers.

AB By the application of film cooling in addition to regenerative cooling, a considerable reduction in thermal and structural loads of rocket combustion-chamber walls can be reached. This paper discusses important influence parameters on film cooling in terms of efficiency of the injected film and wall temperature reduction. For the experimental investigations a high-pressure subscale combustion chamber operated with the cryogenic propellant combination LOX/GH(2) was used. A gaseous film with ambient tempered hydrogen was injected in the axial direction at the face plate. Typical film-cooling parameters such as film blowing rate, velocity ratio between film injection velocity and hot-gas velocity, circumferential slot positioning, and film injection slot height were investigated systematically at the European Research and Technology Test Facility P8.

AB The present paper describes a steady one dimensional model of the hydrogen peroxide decomposition flow in a pellet-type catalytic bed and its application to the parametric design of a typical reactor for small rocket propellant thrusters. The two-phase liquid-gas-vapor flow through the bed is treated as a homogeneous, adiabatic, chemically reacting flow, for which the properties depend on the local composition. Fast equilibrium hydrogen peroxide adsorption and first-order finite-rate desorption is assumed for the one-step hydrogen peroxide decomposition reaction on the catalyst surface. Standard viscous/aerodynamic correlations for porous media are used to account for pressure losses. The predictions of the model depend on a limited number of uncertain parameters, for which the values can be readily determined by comparison with the available experimental data. Good agreement has been attained between the model predictions and the results of hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thruster firings. The model provides a rational framework for identifying the main operational parameters of catalytic pellet beds, understanding their interactions, and efficiently guiding the reactor sizing and design, using the indications easily obtained from sensitivity analyses.

TI Control Effects of Baffle on Combustion Instability in a LOX/GH(2)

DT Article
ID INJECTION
AB The combustion instability encountered unexpectedly in hot-firing tests of the YF-960 liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (LOX/GH(2)) rocket engine was numerically researched. Here, the emphasis was on evaluating the control effects of two kinds of baffle configurations on combustion instability. The integrated physical model and numerical method were presented to solve the turbulent, three-dimensional, two-phase, and full-size LOX/GH(2) rocket combustion process. The dominant oscillation frequency characteristics that appeared in the hot-firing tests were reproduced and confirmed first, which validated the computational fluid dynamics code to a certain extent. The baffle effects were investigated by the developed mass flow flux perturbing model. Results show that the control effect of the hub-and-six-blade baffle on the one-order tangential-mode oscillation frequency of 5800 Hz is better than that of the hub-and-three-blade baffle. Although the two kinds of baffles have similar effects on the radial-mode instability, the control effect is better for damping the 5800 Hz oscillation than the 2900 Hz oscillation. This research has provided direct design data for engineers, and it is valuable in further understanding the baffle-eliminating mechanisms.

AB We present a mid-infrared coronagraph to target the direct observation of extrasolar planets, for Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) SPICA is a proposed JAXA-ESA mission, which will carry a telescope cooled to 5 K with a 3 5 m diameter aperture, and is planned to be launched in 2018 by an H II family rocket. The SPICA mission gives us a unique opportunity for high-contrast observations because of the large telescope aperture, the simple pupil shape, and the capability for infrared observations from space. We have commenced studies for a coronagraph for SPICA, in which this coronagraph is currently regarded as an option of the focal plane instruments The primary target of the SPICA coronagraph is the direct observation of Jovian exo-planets. A strategy of the baseline survey and the specifications for the coronagraph instrument for the survey are introduced together. The main wavelengths and the contrast required for the observations are 3.5-27 mu m, and 10(-6), respectively. Laboratory experiments were performed with a visible laser to demonstrate the principles of the coronagraphs In an experiment using binary-shaped pupil coronagraphs, a contrast of 6 7 x 10(-8) was achieved, as derived from the linear average in the dark region and the core of the point spread function (PSF). A coronagraph by a binary-shaped pupil mask is a baseline solution for SPICA because of its feasibility and robustness On the other hand, a laboratory experiment of the phase induced amplitude apodization/binary-mask hybrid coronagraph has been executed to obtain an option of higher performance (i.e., smaller inner working angle and higher throughput), and a contrast of 6 5 x 10(-7) was achieved with active wavefront control Potentially important by-product of the instrument, transit monitoring for characterization of exo-planets, is also described We also present recent progress of technology on a design of a binary-shaped pupil mask for the actual pupil of SPICA, PSF subtraction, the development of free-standing binary masks, a vacuum chamber, and a cryogenic deformable mirror Considering SPICA to be an essential platform for coronagraphs and the progress of key technologies, we propose to develop a mid-infrared coronagraph instrument for SPICA and to perform the direct observation of exo-planets with it.

DE Ares V
AB When NASA's Arcs V cargo launch vehicle (Fig. 1) begins flying late next decade, its capabilities will significantly exceed the 1960s-era Saturn V. It will send more crew and cargo to more places on the lunar surface than Apollo and provide ongoing support to a permanent lunar outpost that will open the Moon to greater exploration, science and adventure than ever before. Moreover, it will restore the United States' heavy-lift capability, which can support human and robotic exploration for decades to come. Arcs V remains in a pre-design analysis cycle stage pending a planned Authority to Proceed (ATP) in late 2010. Arcs V benefits from the decision to draw from heritage hardware and its commonality with the Arcs I crew launch vehicle, which completed its preliminary design review (PDR) in September 2008. Most of the work on Arcs V to date has been focused on refining the vehicle design through a variety of internal studies. This paper will provide background information on the Arcs V evolution, emphasizing the vehicle configuration as it exists today. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A precooled turbojet engine has been developed by JAXA used for the hypersonic airplane and spaceplane. The subscale engine named "S-engine" whose thrust and weight are about 1.2 kN and 100 kg was designed, fabricated and tested. The components and the system firing tests under the sea-level-static condition were successfully conducted. In the next phase, a flight test of the S-engine is planned using a stratospheric balloon in 2010 called balloon-based operation vehicle (BOV). The vehicle is dropped from an altitude of 40 km by a high altitude balloon. After 40 s free-fall, the vehicle is pulled up and the S-engine operates for 30 s at about Mach 2. High-altitude tests of the core-engine verified the performance and healthiness of the engine under the condition corresponding to the BOV flight trajectory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Mass growth in space vehicle and exploration architecture development
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
DE Design; Launch vehicle; Spacecraft; Mass growth; Margin
AB Inert or dry mass in aerospace systems has historically grown during aerospace vehicle development because of a number of factors: changing requirements, uncertainty in the performance of the initial technology selection, addition of redundancy, errors in the original design, as well as uncertain masses and loads. In the case of exploration architectures for lunar missions, compounding effects of a multi-staged mission design makes mass-efficient vehicles a necessity for achieving the total delta-V performance required to reach the lunar surface and return to Earth. Current standards and guidelines for mass growth risk mitigation are compared, including the industry and NASA standard methods for risk management and mitigation through the application of mass margin. Historical mass growth trends are analyzed, and average levels of growth are compared to the standard margin allocation levels. Analysis of the available historical data shows that the mean inert mass growth is 28%, and 30% of historical programs experience inert mass growth in excess of the allowable growth and margin recommended level of 32.5%. As an illustrative example of the mass growth of lunar exploration architectures the mass growth sensitivity of the Apollo architecture is calculated. Results show that a kilogram of mass growth on the lunar ascent stage is compounded over 800 times in gross mass. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In over 50 years the United Kingdom has designed, built, launched, operated or otherwise contributed to hundreds of spacecraft and space missions. Its scientists, engineers and officials have carved centres of astronautical excellence around the country, participated in a great number of international space programmes and missions and played a leading role in the establishment of the world's main pannational space agency (ESA) and its two precursors, the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). With its Skylark sounding rocket launch of November 1957 the UK was one of the first nations to gather new scientific data as part of the International Geophysical Year. Fifty years on, the UK is an enthusiastic supporter of the Global Exploration Strategy with major commitments to future missions to the moon and to the Mars that exploit the nation's expertise in small satellite and planetary robot technology. And while such mission involvement takes UK space technologies out into the solar system as never before the nation continues to excel in Earth orbit with its development and manufacture of large, increasingly powerful telecommunications satellites. The UK's space heritage and its ongoing and directed activities are rich and productive. And yet-the representation of UK space endeavour is all too often skewed-misleading and unduly pejorative: '...British space... more romance than reality."(1) Why does such partisan commentary occur and why has such an attitude prevailed for so long? This paper seeks some answers by reviewing UK space activity and its historiography in the wider and global context of astronautics between 1957 and 2007.

AB In over 50 years the United Kingdom has designed, built, launched, operated or otherwise contributed to hundreds of spacecraft and space missions. Its scientists, engineers and officials have carved centres of astronautical excellence around the country, participated in a great number of international space programmes and missions and played a leading role in the establishment of the world's main pannational space agency (ESA) and its two precursors, the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organization (ESRO). With its Skylark sounding rocket launch of November 1957 the UK was one of the first nations to gather new scientific data as part of the International Geophysical Year. Fifty years on, the UK is an enthusiastic supporter of the Global Exploration Strategy with major commitments to future missions to the moon and to the Mars that exploit the nation's expertise in small satellite and planetary robot technology. And while such mission involvement takes UK space technologies out into the solar system as never before the nation continues to excel in Earth orbit with its development and manufacture of large, increasingly powerful telecommunications satellites. The UK's space heritage and its ongoing and directed activities are rich and productive. And yet-the representation of UK space endeavour is all too often skewed-misleading and unduly pejorative: '...British space... more romance than reality."(1) Why does such partisan commentary occur and why has such an attitude prevailed for so long? This paper seeks some answers by reviewing UK space activity and its historiography in the wider and global context of astronautics between 1957 and 2007.

AB This article proposes a multidisciplinary design and optimization (MDO) strategy for the conceptual design of a multistage ground-based interceptor (GBI) using hybrid optimization algorithm, which associates genetic algorithm (GA) as a global optimizer with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as a local optimizer. The interceptor is comprised of a three-stage solid propulsion system for an exoatmospheric boost phase intercept (BPI). The interceptor's duty is to deliver a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) to the optimal position in space to accomplish the mission of intercept. The modules for propulsion, aerodynamics, mass properties and flight dynamics are integrated to produce a high fidelity model of the entire vehicle. The propulsion module comprises of solid rocket motor (SRM) grain design, nozzle geometry design and performance prediction analysis. Internal ballistics and performance prediction parameters are calculated by using lumped parameter method. The design objective is to minimize the gross lift off mass (GLOM) of the interceptor under the mission constraints and performance objectives. The proposed design and optimization methodology provide designers with an efficient and powerful approach in computation during designing interceptor systems.

AB Our study evaluated changes in nutritional content of leafy vegetables at harvest and during postharvest in response to nutrient solutions of increasing salinity using a recirculating ebb and flow irrigation system within a controlled environment (CE). Two antioxidants, ascorbic acid (AsA) and total phenolics (TP), were used as proxies for nutrition as determined by the 2,6-dichloroindolphenol titrimetric and the Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively. Two arugulas, Diplotaxis tenuifolia (L.) DC cv. Sylvetta and Eruca sativa (P. Mill.) Thell. cv. Astro, and a garden cress, Lepidium sativum L. CV. Presto, were grown with five salinity levels ranging from 1.5 to 9.5 dS.m(-1) electrical conductivity (EC) during two trials. We observed no difference in TP at harvest in response to salinity treatments in Trial 1 for all species collectively evaluated: however, during Trial 2, the TP at harvest responded to salinity treatments. In contrast, we observed a response in AsA at harvest to salinity treatments during both trials. The response of both TP and AsA to treatments was characterized by variability, both increases and decreases, when contrasting species and trials. We concluded that the variability in the nutritional content of the specific crucifers evaluated might reflect both individual species responses and the modest CE microclimate changes we recorded between trials. In addition, our research suggests that salinity levels greater that an EC of 9.5 dS.m(-1) may be required to define the salinity tolerance of these specific crucifers within a CE.

AB Current methods for uncertainty propagation suffer from their limitations in providing accurate and efficient solutions to high-dimension problems with interactions of random variables. The sparse grid technique, originally invented for numerical integration and interpolation, is extended to uncertainty propagation in this work to overcome the difficulty. The concept of Sparse Grid Numerical Integration (SGNI) is extended for estimating the first two moments of performance in robust design, while the Sparse Grid Interpolation (SGI) is employed to determine failure probability by interpolating the limit-state function at the Most Probable Point (MPP) in reliability analysis. The proposed methods are demonstrated by high-dimension mathematical examples with notable variate interactions and one multidisciplinary rocket design problem. Results show that the use of sparse grid methods works better than popular counterparts. Furthermore, the automatic sampling, special interpolation process, and dimension-adaptivity feature make SGI more flexible and efficient than using the uniform sample based metamodeling techniques.

AB This article develops and presents a technology engineering framework for the selection, development, and insertion of space transportation technologies concurrent with the systems engineering of the space transportation system(s) in which the technology will eventually be employed. The technology engineering framework developed and presented in this article draws on existing systems engineering processes, tools, and methods; takes into account the differences between systems engineering and technology engineering; and accounts for the high degree of interaction required between the concurrent technology and system development programs. The components of this technology engineering framework are discussed, and the major steps in the technology engineering process are outlined. An investigation is also conducted into facilitating the implementation of key portions of the framework using a state-of-the-art relational computer database referred to as the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Technology Database (RTDB). This database is demonstrated to provide an invaluable tool to collect, manipulate, analyze, document, and disseminate technology-related information, including previous research results, key technical parameters and characteristics, technology readiness levels, relationships to other technologies, costs, and potential barriers and risks.

TI Robust terminal area energy management guidance using flatness approach
SO IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS
AB This study deals with the design of a guidance scheme based on flatness theory and dedicated to the terminal area energy management phase of a reusable launch vehicle. The proposed guidance strategy is based on a non-linear dynamic inversion technique to handle the large flight envelope that characterises the reentry mission. This inversion takes advantage of a particular choice of linearising terms called flat outputs, that are used to perform an input-to-state linearisation. First, it is shown that the coupled in-plane and out-of-plane vehicle dynamics admits a set of flat outputs. The flatness property of this model is then used to compute the nominal control input profiles corresponding to a single reference trajectory computed off-line. Based on the linearised model obtained by dynamic inversion, a linear tracking controller is then designed so as to circumvent off-nominal flight conditions. Finally, robustness and performances of the proposed guidance scheme are assessed by performing Monte Carlo runs within an industrial simulation environment.

TI A Failure Mechanism of Pressure Vessels from Filament-wound Hoop Layer
SO JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
DE filament winding; cylindrical shell; transverse crack; debonding; stress
   concentration
AB This article studied a possible mechanism of a failure from a thick hoop layer of a filament-wound rocket motor case with long cylindrical portion analytically and numerically. The hoop-wound fibers at the cylindrical portion was slightly inclined from the circumferential direction as a finite width prepreg tape was wound without overlapping or gap by alternately feeding in forward and backward direction. Fiber stress concentration in the hoop layer due to possible damage states was assessed through analytical studies and a rough estimate of the stress concentration was given by explicit functions. The possible damage consisted of transverse cracks slightly inclined from each other and debonding of the interface between the hoop layer and the base layer. The approximate analytical solution agreed well with the numerical results in spite of simplification. The results could show the possibility of stress enhancement due to damage in the thick hoop layer made of two slight inclined fibers and important guideline for the design of filament winding pressure vessels.

AB Composite material usage is necessary on NASA's future launch vehicles in order to obtain a low mass vehicle. While aircraft and launch vehicles that utilize load-bearing composite components have many similar damage tolerance requirements, the distinct differences between a part that has a lifetime of similar to 500 s (one launch) and can be inspected in detail before use and one that has a lifetime of many tens of thousands of flight hours and can only undergo a 'walk around' inspection before each flight (commercial transport) needs to be taken into account. This article presents these differences and uses data from the ARES I composite interstage as an example of how to arrive at preliminary compression after impact strength values for the sandwich structure in the acerage of this part using residual strength curves. Results show that if severity of damage can be quantified by a nondestructive method (other than dent depth), the mass of the structure can be reduced due to better characterization of the damage.

AB The design and operational parameters of rocket exhaust diffusers equipped to simulate high-altitude rocket performance on the ground were investigated and characterized using a comprehensive approach (theoretical, numerical, and experimental). The physical model of concern includes a rocket motor, a vacuum chamber, and a diffuser, which have axisymmetric configurations. Further, the operational characteristics of a rocket exhaust diffuser were analyzed from a flow development point of view. Emphasis was placed on detailed flow structure in the diffuser, to observe the pressure oscillation in both the vacuum chamber and diffuser, which determines the minimum rocket-motor pressure required to start the diffuser. Numerical simulations were compared with experimental data on startup and in operational conditions to understand the effects of major design parameters, including the area ratio of diffuser to rocket-motor nozzle throat, the rocket-motor pressure, and the vacuum-chamber size.

AB A modified sheet breakup model was applied to a thin, viscous liquid film generated by a swirl injector similar to that installed in a liquid propellant rocket engine combustor. The sheet breakup model consists of three steps: determination of the swirl injector characteristics for the prediction of initial sheet conditions at the injector exit as input, linear stability analysis for primary sheet breakup, and the Taylor analogy breakup model for final drop formation. Under atmospheric pressure, the liquid sheet breakup occurs under a long-wave regime, sometimes according to simple theoretical analysis. But in high ambient pressure conditions, like a liquid propellant rocket engine combustor, the sheet breakup regime changes from a long wave to a short-wave regime due to a high gas Weber number (We(2) > 27/16), although the same injector was used. The sheet breakup model was, therefore, modified to be applicable to both long- and short-wave regimes and validated by the comparison of breakup length and Sauter mean diameter to experimental results. In both experimental and computational results, the spray cone angle and breakup length decreased as the ambient pressure increased, even though the pressure difference of the injector was constant. Local Sauter mean diameters, predicted by computation, were smaller at high ambient pressures. The comparative results show that the computational model is able to accurately predict sheet breakup length, spray cone angle, local Sauter mean diameter, and overall spray shape. Therefore, the model can be used as a design tool, ahead of analyzing spray characteristics of an injector in both atmospheric and high ambient pressure conditions.

TI Operability Benefits of Airbreathing Hypersonic Propulsion for Flexible
   Access to Space
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Hypersonic airbreathing propulsion has been considered as an enhancement for access-to-space systems for decades. However, previous research using metrics such as takeoff gross weight and payload weight fraction has not shown conclusive benefits for airbreathing systems when compared with all-rocket launch vehicles. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory has developed new operability-based metrics relevant to U.S. Air Force missions: time to rendezvous with a target spacecraft, number of launch opportunities per day, and launch-window duration. Computation of the new metrics requires launch vehicle ascent trajectory optimization, orbital transfer solutions, and Monte Carlo analysis. Ascent optimization uses propulsion throttling, aerodynamic turning, and pitch control to command downrange and crossrange at the orbital insertion point while using minimum propellant. Then the two-point boundary-value problem is solved to find a minimum-propellant transfer orbit to rendezvous with the target. Monte Carlo analysis assigns the orbital target a random starting position over the Earth and then propagates the orbit until rendezvous is accomplished and the metrics can be computed. The Air Force's Reusable Military Launch System all-rocket launch vehicle RMLS 102 is compared against Alliant Techsystems' rocket-based combined-cycle launch system ATK-RBCC. The results of the Monte Carlo analysis show that ATK-RBCC featuring airbreathing propulsion combined with a high lift-over-drag airframe exhibits significant operability benefits. The developed operability metrics could help to transform access to space by demonstrating clear payoffs from airbreathing propulsion.

TI Orbital Propellant Depots Enabling Lunar Architectures Without
   Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Many human lunar exploration architectures, both flown and conceptual, use at least one heavy-lift launch vehicle to deliver flight hardware to low Earth orbit. There exists a technology, however, that allows these large exploration missions to be performed without the use of a heavy-lift launch vehicle: propellant transfer. This study presents a methodology to incorporate propellant transfer into conceptual design of lunar architectures through the use of a low-Earth-orbit propellant depot. This technology is then applied to a two-launch human lunar architecture without a heavy-lift launch vehicle. The results show that not only is a lunar architecture without a heavy-lift launch vehicle feasible with a propellant depot, but it can also improve the capability to deliver payload to the surface over an architecture that includes a heavy-lift launch vehicle without a propellant depot. The optimal lunar lander for this architecture is a hypergolic lander with a deck height of only 1.53 meters that performs only a portion of the descent burn, while the trans-lunar injection stage performs the other portion. The hypergolic propellant allows for a simpler, less expensive propulsion system, a volumetrically smaller lander, and enables the use of the existing hypergolic propellant transfer technology.

AB LISA Pathfinder, formerly known as SMART-2, is the second of the European Space Agency's Small Missions for Advance Research and Technology, and is designed to pave the way for the joint ESA/NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, by testing the core assumption of gravitational wave detection and general relativity: that free particles follow geodesics. The new technologies to be demonstrated in a space environment include: inertial sensors, high precision laser interferometry to free floating mirrors, and micro-Newton proportional thrusters. LISA Pathfinder will be launched on a dedicated launch vehicle in late 2011 into a low Earth orbit. By a transfer trajectory, the sciencecraft will enter its final orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point. First science results are expected approximately 3 months thereafter.
   Here, we give an overview of the mission including the technologies being demonstrated.

AB The Ares V Cargo launch vehicle that is being designed by NASA for the Constellation Program, with its 10 m diameter fairing and ability to place 130,000 kg in low earth orbit, will enable telescopes with apertures much larger than the 6.5 m of the James Webb Space Telescope to be placed in orbit.
   In this paper we revisit our designs for large aperture telescopes that could be launched with today's expendable launch vehicles and show what aperture sizes would be enabled by the Ares V. Our assessment includes both monolithic and autonomously deployed telescopes, as well as those which could be assembled on orbit. We also address the requirements these payloads might impose on the Ares V design. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
DE Expansion deflection nozzle; Experimental rocket engine; Altitude

ID PLUG NOZZLES; THRUST
AB This paper provides an overview of results generated by the static test expansion-deflection rocket nozzle (STERN) project. The engine propellants were gaseous air and hydrogen, with a design chamber pressure and thrust of 102 bar and 5 kN respectively. The maximum chamber pressure achieved was restricted to 55 bar absolute, due to a conservative approach in the test programme dictated by the uncertainty in heat transfer to the pintle. Despite this, the programme achieved many successes, including the first tests of an ED nozzle in the UK: the production of significant amounts of data for both the analysis of the performance of the nozzle and the verification of analysis codes; and an improved compensation performance over that apparent from earlier work, including demonstration of attached flow to the exit plane for all chamber pressures. Whilst the wake pressure was not as high as hoped, ranging between 70% and 95% of ambient and apparently inversely related to chamber pressure, this result is still sufficiently encouraging to warrant further investigation of the type. As importantly, the data derived from the experiments, including performance analysis and wall pressure variations in time and space, are now being made available to the wider academic community, something which for commercial reasons appears to be a unique occurrence for this type of nozzle.

AB Atmospheric and space launch stage separation depends on the aerodynamic interference between separating bodies. Quick means of estimating and controlling repulsion or attraction lift associated with this interaction are an important enabling technology to achieve the best compromise between launch separation rocket motor weight and safe staging. Asymptotic methods, scattering, and slender-body theories are used to obtain systematic approximation schemes that advantageously couple with computational methods. Theoretical solutions for the lift interference between two bodies in supersonic flow agree well with numerical solutions. The theory sheds light on import-ant scattering phenomena not previously recognized as relevant to this problem. The analysis helps to identify lumped dimensionless parameters and provides scaling laws as well as closed-form expressions for the interference not accessible solely from computations. These results can be used for interpolation and extrapolation of computational fluid dynamics solutions as well as efficient testing and design of flight vehicles.

AB Nanomaterials are a topic of increased interest, since they have properties which differ from their macroscopic counterparts. Many applications nowadays take advantage of the new functionalities which natural and manufactured nanoparticles possess. Based on these developments, also the research on energetic nanomaterials is receiving more and more attention. Apart from the synthesis of energetic nanomaterials, another area of interest is the coating of energetic (nano)powders, in order to be able to modify their properties or to add new functionalities to these particles. (Modified) energetic materials find applications in explosives, gun and rocket propellants and pyrotechnic devices. The modified energetic materials are expected to yield enhanced properties, e.g. a lower vulnerability towards shock initiation, enhanced blast, enhanced shelf-life and environmentally friendly replacements of currently used materials.
   An experimental set-up for the coating of existing powders has been designed and constructed. The experimental technique is based on a special plasma application which, contrary to more general plasmas, can be operated at relatively low temperatures and ambient pressure. This allows the handling of heat-sensitive materials, which would otherwise readily decompose or react at higher temperatures. The facility used for the coating of energetic powders in the lower micron range is based on a fluidized bed reactor in which the powder circulates.
   In this paper, the experimental technique will be described and experimental results will be shown of CuO powders that have been coated with a very thin, nanoscale deposit of a SiO-containing layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Nitrous oxide cooling in hybrid rocket nozzles
SO PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Review
AB The Department of Mechanical Engineering at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, has developed an innovative program of experimental research and development on hybrid rocket motors (where the fuel and the oxidizer are in different phases prior to combustion). One project currently underway involves the development of aerospike nozzles for such motors. These nozzles, however, are even more susceptible to throat ablation than regular converging-diverging nozzles, due the nature of their flow expansion mechanism. This paper presents the result of a recent development project focused on reducing throat ablation in hybrid rocket motor nozzles. Although the method is specifically targeted at increasing the life and operating range of aerospike nozzles, this paper describes its proof-of-concept implementation on conventional nozzles. The method is based on a regenerative cooling mechanism that differs in practice from that used in liquid propellant motors. A series of experimental tests demonstrate that this new method is not only effective at reducing damage in the most ablative region of the nozzle, but that the nozzle can survive multiple test runs.

AB For the last 50 years solid propulsion has successfully created a multitude of small launchers and many first stages or boosters for heavy launchers with low risk, high performance. competitive cost, superb storability, and "instant" readiness in many countries. Technical Support for these successes arose from simple designs, very high thrust levels, and low development and operation costs/risks. The first solid propulsion roadmap based on these foundations and rational projections was published in 2000 [A. Davenas, D. Boury, M. Calabro, B. D'Andrea, A. McDonald, Solid propulsion for space applications: a roadmap, in: 51st International Astronautical Congress, paper IAA-00-IAA.3.3.02, October 2000]. Moreover, subsequent information Supports its enabling technologies (high strength composite cases. energetic material processing based on continuous mixing, low density insulation, reduced actuator energy requirements, and advanced detailed simulations) and applications (first stages, strap-on, add-ons, small launchers, and niche space applications). Missions currently devoted to solid propulsion and plans for present and future launchers and exploration mission developments in the USA, Japan, and Europe are sketched and targeted improvements, and potential breakthroughs are discussed.

   exploration missions
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
DE Lunar lander; Secondary payload
AB The development of low cost missions for lunar exploration has emerged as a topic of increasing interest. Recently a study team from JPL was tasked to consider potential high-value lunar surface science and exploration missions that could be performed with small, low cost landed assets, with particular emphasis on missions that could be flown as secondary payloads on evolved expendable launch vehicle (EELV) launches. A mission concept and flight system design was developed in the course of this study that would deliver a network of up to six individual landers to a local lunar region, utilizing the full capabilities of the EELV secondary payload adapter (ESPA). The braking burn of the six landers would be performed by a single solid rocket motor integral with the ESPA ring, following which the landers would separate from the ESPA and perform final descent and precision landing using their own onboard propulsion systems. The six landers would initiate a one year mission, performing site survey and environmental science measurements including illumination, temperature, radiation, soil mechanics, and seismometry. Additional payload accommodation would be available on each lander to include unique experiments. The lander design was constrained to fit within the requirements for accommodation on the ESPA. These include a wet mass of no more than 180 kg, and dimensions that fit in an envelope of 61x71x96cm. The total landed mass of the conceptual spacecraft is similar to 140kg which would deliver a total of similar to 15 kg of payload mass to the lunar surface, per lander. In addition to the multi-lander ESPA-based design, a single lander flight system variant was developed that could enable globally distributed network science at very low cost. This paper discusses the mission concepts, flight system designs and numerous system engineering challenges that led to the development of this uniquely flexible and cost effective lunar mission concept.

   separation
AB An analysis was made about the flow characteristics and the rocket motion during supersonic separation of a air-launching rocket from the mother plane. The three-dimensional Euler equations were numerically solved to analyze the steady/unsteady flow fields around the rocket. The simulation results clearly demonstrated the effect of shock-expansion wave interaction between the rocket and its mother plane. A comprehensive analysis showed that the presence of properly designed fins can make the pitch-up motion be more stabilized, and design parameters such as fin size and location of the center of gravity of the rocket are essentially important factors for safe separation. Finally, a guideline about the supersonic air-launching rocket design for safe separation is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Launch vehicle noise is broadband in nature and the noise transmitted into the payload fairing is reduced by treating its interior with an acoustic absorption layer. The latest generation payload fairings are made from composite material which offer poor noise attenuation at low frequencies. One possible solution for reducing the low frequency noise is to use Helmholtz resonators tuned to a few of the dominant low frequency components, such as shell ring frequency or the first few cavity modes of the fairing. The paper presents a simplified modelling approach for numerical simulation of a coupled cavity-resonator system which is validated by experiments. The influence of damping and resonator volume fraction on the coupled system performance, to suppress the first axial mode in a cylindrical cavity, is shown and the resonator volume fraction required for significantly (more than 5 dB) suppressing the cavity axial mode is established.

AB A direct detection Doppler lidar for measuring wind speed in the middle atmosphere up to 80 km with 2 h resolution was implemented in the ALOMAR Rayleigh/Mie/Raman lidar (69 degrees N, 16 degrees E). The random error of the line of sight wind is about 0.6 m/s and 10 m/s at 49 km and 80 km, respectively. We use a Doppler Rayleigh Iodine Spectrometer (DoRIS) at the iodine line 1109 (similar to 532.260 nm). DoRIS uses two branches of intensity cascaded channels to cover the dynamic range from 10 to 100 km altitude. The wind detection system was designed to extend the existing multi-wavelength observations of aerosol and temperature performed at wavelengths of 355 nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm. The lidar uses two lasers with a mean power of 14 W at 532 nm each and two 1.8 m diameter tiltable telescopes. Below about 49 km altitude the accuracy and time resolution is limited by the maximum count rate of the detectors used and not by the number of photons available. We report about the first simultaneous Rayleigh temperature and wind measurements by lidar in the strato- and mesosphere on 17 and 23 January 2009.

AB This paper reviews the current status of understanding, theory, and models for the physics of liquid fuel atomization, particularly as it applies to gas turbine and rocket applications. The paper covers five areas pertinent to atomization issues in gas turbine and rocket combustors: (1) major references in subtopic areas, (2) state-of-the-art understanding of the physical mechanisms in atomization and vaporization for gas turbine and rocket combustors, (3) models and limitations of such models, (4) references to available data sets, and (5) identification of research gaps. Although written specifically to address the requirements for rocket and gas turbine atomization, this paper identifies issues and concerns that are of interest to other users and practitioners of atomization devices, as well as developers of custom and commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. Members of the Institute for Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems (ILASS), Americas' Rocket and Air Breathing Power Fuel Atomization Committee, made the bulk of the contributions to this paper. This paper is revised from the version presented by Benjamin and Jensen at the Eighth International Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems (ICLASS-2000), Pasadena, California, July 16-20, 2000.

TI Modeling of Solid Propellants Viscoplastic Behavior Using Evolutionary

DE solid rocket fuel; experimental studies; modeling; constitutive law;
   evolutionary algorithms; numerical simulation
AB In the paper an initial attempt to the experimental analysis of viscous effects, characteristic for homogeneous solid rocket fuels is proposed. For this reason uniaxial tensile experiments, carried out on dumbbell homogeneous solid propellants have been chosen. Laboratory tests have been carried out on INSTRON tensile testing machine. Research schedule involved destructive tensile tests with various strain rates. Three different values of strain rates have been taken into consideration. Experimentally obtained hardening curves are presented in suitable diagrams.
   Basing on obtained results, authors confirm the viscoplastic behavior of studied materials. Essential impact of the applied strain rate on the position of experimental hardening curves is observed. Acquired results are the base for the further stage of investigations of homogeneous solid propellants - the modeling of their physical properties.
   Additionally, numerical modeling of studied phenomena, using the viscoplastic Chaboche's model, identified on the basis of experimental data, is presented. The material parameters of the constitutive law are determined numerically using an evolutionary algorithm procedure. The efficiency of the model and the identification approach are discussed.

AB The rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a new engine system using detonation, which may provide a higher performance and smaller and simpler design in comparison with the pulse detonation engine (PDE) and other traditional engines. However the research on RDE stands just at the first step now. The authors perform a numerical analysis to understand about RDE in terms of features of rotating detonation and its propagation limit. The lower threshold pressure of detonation limit was 2.6MPa and the upper threshold pressure of detonation limit was 7.1MPa. The engine performance analysis shows that the maximum mixture based specific impulse (Ispm) was about 440s, which is comparable with that of the present typical rocket engine.

AB The application of high-velocity impact machines, designed to realize different technological processes (as a closed-die forging of steel details, pile tamping of soils by pile foundation, etc.) that are related to use in rocket engines for driving of impact devices (hammer rams) is a new modern field in industry. Based on the mathematical model and algorithms (discussed in [(4)]), that describe dynamic behaviour of a rocket impact device in the preparatory phase, a programme is written for calculation of the situational and dynamic characteristics of the pile tamping process preparatory phase. The organization of the developed computer programme for characteristics calculation and their visualization is illustrated.

DE Lactuca sativa; Eruca sativa; competition; agronomic efficiency
AB Productivity of lettuce and rocket in intercropping system under organic and mineral fertilization Two experiments were carried out at Federal University of Lavras Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from April to September, 2006, aiming to evaluate the lettuce and rocket intercropping system, under organic and mineral fertilization in different spatial arrangements. For each experiment, the experimental design was randomized complete blocks with five treatments and four replicates. The treatments consisted of four spatial arrangements of lettuce (a) and rocket (r), planted in alternate rows 1A: 1R; alternate double rows 2A: 2R; alternate triple rows 3A: 3R, alternate four rows 4A: 4R and lettuce and rocket in sole crop. Evaluations for diameter (lettuce), plant height, number of leaves per plant, leaf yield and leaf dry matter were made in the lettuce and rocket crop. The highest yield of lettuce leaves was registered in the organic farming. The yield of rocket fresh mass, in sole crop was higher than the others although statistically similar to the spatial arrangements 3A: 3R and 4A: 4R for the number of leaves. In organic farming, significant differences between first rocket growth and regrowth were observed in plant height and shoot dry mass, with the highest average of plant height registered in the growth and the highest shoot dry mass in the regrowth. The intercropping systems of lettuce and rocket in the spatial arrangements of IA: 1 R and 3A: 3R had the highest efficiency (LER), ranging from 55 to 63%, respectively, in the organic farming. Biological efficiency increased up to 62 and 70% in these same arrangements, with the regrowth of the rocket in the organic farming. All the associations of the lettuce and rocket as well as their sole crop had better productive performance under the organic fertilization and the regrowth of rocket increased the agronomic efficiency of the intercropping system.

TI Fifty years of fluidic injection for jet noise reduction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROACOUSTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MIXING ENHANCEMENT; WATER INJECTION; MICROJETS; TURBULENCE
AB The paper reviews 50 years of research investigating jet noise reduction through fluidic injection. Both aqueous and gaseous injection concepts for supersonic and subsonic jet exhausts are discussed. Aqueous injection reduces jet noise by reducing main jet temperature through evaporation and main jet velocity through momentum transfer between water droplets and the main jet. In the launch vehicle environment where large quantities of fluid do not have to be carried with the vehicle, water injection is very effective at reducing excess overpressures. For in-flight use, aqueous injection is problematic as most studies show that either large quantities of water or high injection pressures are required to achieve noise reduction. The most effective noise reduction injection systems require water pressures above 2000 kPa (290 psi) and water-to-main-jet mass flow rates above 10% to achieve overall sound pressure level reductions of roughly 6 dB in the peak jet noise direction. Injection at lower pressure (roughly 1034 kPa or 150 psi) has resulted in a 1.6 EPNdb reduction in effective perceived noise level. Gaseous injection reduces noise through jet plume modifications resulting from the introduction of streamwise vorticity in the main jet. In subsonic single-stream jets, air injection usually produces the largest overall sound pressure level reductions (roughly 2 dB) in the peak jet noise direction. In dual-stream jets, properly designed injection systems can reduce overall sound pressure levels and effective perceived noise levels but care must be taken to choose injector designs that limit sound pressure level increases at high frequencies. A reduction of 1.0 EPNdB has been achieved with injection into the fan and core streams. However, air injection into dual-stream subsonic jets has received little attention and the potential for noise reduction is uncertain at this time. For dual-stream supersonic jets, additional research needs to be conducted to determine if reductions can be achieved with injection pressures available from current aircraft engines.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TURBO & JET-ENGINES

DE Multiobjective optimization; turbopump design
AB Designers of aerospace turbopumps have to decide which specifications should be given to the machine geometry so that it performs the desired tasks in the best possible way. The aim of this work is to develop an useful tool helping the designer to obtain the best pump performance without using computationally expensive codes, e.g. those based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Therefore, a meanline pump model, based on theoretical equations and empirical correlations is implemented to provide a fast means of modeling pumps for cryogenic rocket engines; anyway it can predict the performance of pumps when they operate within design as well as off-design operative conditions. Moreover, the pump model can simulate axial inducer, mixed-flow and centrifugal pumps and also multistage pumps in series which are very common in aerospace applications. The pump model is tested and calibrated against experimental data using an appropriate optimization genetic algorithm which searches the best parameters set enabling the maximum superposition between the simulated and the experimentally measured operative points. Next, a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) using a combination of three population evolution methods searches the best turbopump geometrical configurations which, for a given head curve, improve the pump efficiency as much as possible. Such multi-objective genetic optimizer is based on the ordination of nominated, solutions into a non-dominated set of solutions, which in turn are based on the dominance concept. The overall procedure allows finding a great number of optimal and feasible constructive configurations for the considered turbopumps.

AB Boron carbide is a strategic material, finding applications in nuclear industry, armour for personnel and vehicle safety, rocket propellant, etc. Its high hardness makes it suitable for grinding and cutting tools, ceramic bearing, wire drawing dies, etc. Boron carbide is commercially produced either by carbothermic reduction of boric acid in electric furnaces or by magnesiothermy in presence of carbon. Since many specialty applications of boron carbide require dense bodies, its densification is of great importance. Hot pressing and hot isostatic pressing are the main processes employed for densification. In the recent past, various researchers have made attempts to improve the existing methods and also invent new processes for synthesis and consolidation of boron carbide. All the techniques on synthesis and consolidation of boron carbide are discussed in detail and critically reviewed.

ID DESIGN
AB System design of liquid rocket engines must consider engine performance, weight, cost, and reliability requirements. A general design optimization framework has been developed in this paper to select the best system parameters for liquid rocket engines with gas-generator cycles. The object is to maximize the specific impulse and vacuum thrust-to-weight ratio of the engine with given system requirements and design assumptions by changing thrust-chamber pressure and mixture ratio. The system analysis, along with the engine weight estimation, is based on a modular scheme. Multidisciplinary design optimization formulations including multidisciplinary feasible and collaborative optimization are used, evaluated, and compared during the optimization process. Several techniques of multi-objective processing are also used to identify the Pareto frontier and the optimal compromise solutions. A proposed cryogenic-propellant engine using liquid oxygen and hydrogen with a gas-generator cycle is studied as a specific example. Moreover, uncertainties in the engine operation, such as thrust-chamber pressure and mixture ratio, are taken into account as random variables in the reliability-based optimization. Results are presented to illustrate the tradeoff between the engine performance and reliability requirements.

TI It's NOT rocket science: rethinking our metaphors for research in health
   professions education
SO MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION; QUALITY
AB Context
   The health professional education community is struggling with a number of issues regarding the place and value of research in the field, including: the role of theory-building versus applied research; the relative value of generalisable versus contextually rich, localised solutions, and the relative value of local versus multi-institutional research. In part, these debates are limited by the fact that the health professional education community has become deeply entrenched in the notion of the physical sciences as presenting a model for 'ideal' research. The resulting emphasis on an 'imperative of proof' in our dominant research approaches has translated poorly to the domain of education, with a resulting denigration of the domain as 'soft' and 'unscientific' and a devaluing of knowledge acquired to date. Similarly, our adoption of the physical sciences''imperative of generalisable simplicity' has created difficulties for our ability to represent well the complexity of the social interactions that shape education and learning at a local level.
   Methods
   Using references to the scientific paradigms associated with the physical sciences, this paper will reconsider the place of our current goals for education research in the production and evolution of knowledge within our community, and will explore the implications for enhancing the value of research in health professional education.
   Conclusions
   Reorienting education research from its alignment with the imperative of proof to one with an imperative of understanding, and from the imperative of simplicity to an imperative of representing complexity well may enable a shift in research focus away from a problematic search for proofs of simple generalisable solutions to our collective problems, towards the generation of rich understandings of the complex environments in which our collective problems are uniquely embedded.

AB Liquid propellants, which are typically used for regenerative cooling of rocket thrust chambers, can flow in channels at supercritical pressures and in the neighborhood of pseudocritical temperature (near-critical fluid). This could be for instance the case for the envisioned liquid-oxygen/liquid-methane engines with chamber pressures larger than about 50 bar. When the fluid is in such a near-critical condition, deterioration in heat transfer can occur if the heat transfer level is higher than a threshold value. Aiming to improve flow prediction capabilities for the design of such systems, the present study is devoted to numerical simulations of near-critical fluids flowing in uniformly heated straight tubes. After code validation against experimental data of near-critical-hydrogen flow, numerical simulations of near-critical-methane flow in heated tubes are carried out, each characterized by a different wall heat flux. Results are discussed in detail and the near-critical-methane flow condition that exhibits the heat transfer deterioration is identified and emphasized.

AB A CO2 thermal rocket that utilizes an indigenous resource directly for propulsion in Mars is proposed. The cycle of the proposed novel CO2 thermal rocket combines a CO2 power cycle with a cryogenic cycle, which is driven by solar energy. Filling CO2 after every hop enables the concept hopper with the CO2 thermal rocket to visit several regions of the planet. The energy available for consumption in the processes of the proposed CO2 thermal rocket is analysed; the simulation results obtained by applying the first law of thermodynamics show that the performance of the cycle of the CO2 thermal rocket is improved by properly designing such a system for the recovery of freezing CO2 cold energy and waste heat during the cryogenic cycle. Furthermore, the effect of thermodynamic parameters on the performance of the cycle of the CO2 thermal rocket is evaluated through parametric analysis; the results show that environmental temperature, nozzle inlet temperature, helium mass flowrate, etc. are the factors affecting thrust-specific power consumption.

AB The control system design and experimental investigation of the gas regulating system for a ducted rocket are studied in this article. First, the dynamic model of the gas regulating system for the ducted rocket was established, and comparison of the two regulating modes regarding non-linearity and uncertainty was done. In contrast with the area-regulated mode, the non-linearity of the pressure-balanced mode is smaller and the robustness is stronger. Then, the study of the the gas control system is performed based on the model established in this article. The introduction of high-gain feedback suppresses the effects of non-linearity and uncertainty in the pneumatic servo system. Also, a proportional-integral controller for the gas regulating system based on linear matrix inequality is designed. Lastly, an experimental investigation of the gas flow control system is done to verify the validity of the gas control system. The experimental result shows that the gas flow control system has good performance. The turndown ratio of mass flow through the control valve was up to 3.7:1.

AB The maximum performance of a supersonic inlet will be achieved when operating as close as possible to its buzz boundary In order to maintain high performance without crossing the buzz boundary, an active buzz margin predictor and controller is necessary. The goal of a control system is to acquire inlet buzz margin and maintain it as the designated value and predict inlet buzz before it occurs and then take some measures to buzz mitigation or inlet restart. The inlet buzz boundary and the margin of ducted rockets were first discussed and analysed. Then the dynamic mathematical model of a gas flow control system was established. Lastly, the inlet buzz margin controller of a ducted rocket was designed. Simulation results show that there exist antiregulation characteristics for gas flow control for ducted rockets, and it leads to the particularity of inlet buzz margin control for ducted rockets in contrast to liquid ramjet. The designed inlet buzz margin has to be bigger to avoid the appearing of inlet buzz because of anti-regulation characteristics; otherwise, the inlet buzz phenomenon probably appears. If the inlet buzz of the ducted rocket appears, the command of decreasing fuel flow could not be given immediately; otherwise, the inlet buzz will aggravate.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper investigates the use of an L-1 adaptive controller direct approach to solve the attitude control problem of a launch vehicle (LV) during its atmospheric phase of flight. One of the most important difficulties in designing a controller for launch vehicles (LVs) is the widely changing system parameters during launch. Aerospace systems such as aircraft or missiles are subject to environmental and dynamical uncertainties. These uncertainties can alter the performance and stability of these systems. Unknown variations in thrust and atmospheric properties, eccentricities of nozzles, and other unknown conditions cause changes in a system. The L-1 adaptive controller ensures uniformly bound transient and asymptotic tracking for the system's signals - input and output - simultaneously. This adaptive control technique quickly compensates for large changes in the LV dynamics. The effect of feedback gain selection and robustness of this approach against system uncertainties and actuator disturbances are also discussed. The adaptive control method is then simulated with representative LV longitudinal motion. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes is demonstrated through hardware-in-the-loop simulation.

AB Conceptual design of aerospace devices with low weight and high performance has currently been the aim of many researches and this has led to appearance of the flexibility in structures of these devices. These flexible behaviours have considerable effects on the flight dynamic and this problem in launch vehicles with cluster bodies is more important. Nonetheless, in the previous works, this aerospace device is only modelled as a single flexible body which is not enough for complete vibrational analysis. Hence, in this article, a non-linear dynamic model of a flexible clustered launch vehicle with one central core and two symmetrical clusters is extracted in the vector matrix format via the quasi-coordinate Lagrange method. Continuously, in order to verify the extracted dynamic model, the system is also modelled as a flexible multi-body in ADAMS software. Finally, parameters of the equation-based model and the ADAMS model are compared. Investigation on the results of this comparison shows satisfactory validation of the equations of motion.

TI ORGANIC CROP OF ROCKET IN NO-TILLAGE ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF MULCHING AND
   DOSES OF COMPOST
SO REVISTA CAATINGA

DT Article
DE Soil covering; Organic matter; Organic crop
AB The objective of that work was to evaluate the influence of different soil mulching and doses of organic compost in the culture of the rocket. The experimental design was used in randomized blocks, in split-plot arrangement with four replications. The plot corresponded to the soil mulching (no-tillage with living mulch of Arachis pintoi, living mulch of native weed, straw mulch of native weed and conventional tillage without mulching). The plots represent the doses of organic compost (10, 20 and 30 t ha(-1) in the dry compost). The variables analyzed were yield, commercial fresh matter, and dry matter of the aerial part. The dose of 30 t ha(-1) provided the largest yield values and commercial fresh mass for the conventional system and straw mulch. The dose 20.49 t ha(-1) increased yield and commercial fresh mass for A. pintoi mulch. The dose 20.85 t ha(-1) showed greater increase in yield and commercial fresh mass for the live native weed. The tillage and straw mulch presented higher yield values for all the studied doses. The dose of 23.1 t ha(-1) it promoted the largest dry mass of the aerial part. The tillage and no-tillage with straw mulch it contributed with the largest dry matter of the aerial part.

AB The Very high Angular resolution ULtraviolet Telescope (VAULT) is a sounding rocket payload built to study the crucial interface between the solar chromosphere and the corona by observing the strongest line in the solar spectrum, the Ly alpha line at 1216 angstrom. In two flights, VAULT succeeded in obtaining the first ever subarcsecond (0.5 '') images of this region with high sensitivity and cadence. Detailed analyses of those observations contributed significantly to new ideas about the nature of the transition region. Here, we present a broad overview of the Ly alpha atmosphere as revealed by the VAULT observations and bring together past results and new analyses from the second VAULT flight to create a synthesis of our current knowledge of the high-resolution Ly alpha Sun. We hope that this work will serve as a good reference for the design of upcoming Ly alpha telescopes and observing plans.

   Lilley whose efforts contributed enormously to the success of the NRL
   sounding rocket programs. We are grateful to V. Yurchyshyn for providing
   calibrated BBSO H alpha images, and to J. Cook, J. Koza, S. Martin, R.
   Rutten, and J. C. Vial for useful discussion and constant encouragement.
   The achievements presented in this article are the product of many years
   of development work at the Naval Research Laboratory Solar Physics
   Branch and the NASA sounding rocket program. The VAULT instrument
   borrows heavily from the High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph. The
   NRL rocket team of J. Smith, R. Moye, R. Hagood, R. Feldman, J. Moser,
   D. Roberts, T. Spears, and R. Waymire did a superb job in preparing and
   launching the instrument. We would like to acknowledge the efforts of
   the sounding rocket support team that made the VAULT launches possible.
   We would like to particularly acknowledge the following individuals.
   Tracy Gibb did a superb job managing the launch of the VAULT payload.
   Frank Lau managed the development of the Mark 7 digital SPARCS attitude
   control system. We would like to acknowledge the SPARCS team for their
   superb efforts in the support of our launch. Jesus and Carlos Martinez
   developed and operated the Mark 7 SPARCS. Richard Garcia, Shelby Elborn,
   and Kenneth Starr developed the VAULT telemetry section. The support
   from the White Sands Missile Range and Wallops Flight Facility NASROC
   personnel was of the highest caliber. The VAULT instrument development
   work was supported by the ONR task area SP033-02-43 and by NASA defense
   procurement request S-84002F. SOHO (EIT, MDI, and SUMER data) is a
   project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA.

AB The Indian Space programme took birth on November 21, 1963, with the launch of Nike-Apache, an American sounding rocket from the shores of Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram on the west coast of India. From a family of operational Sounding rockets known as the Rohini Sounding Rockets, India's launch vehicles have now grown Lip through SLV-3 and Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) to the current gigantic satellite launchers, PSLV and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Though we had failures in the initial launches of SLV-3, ASLV and PSLV, these failures gave Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) a thorough and in depth understanding of the nuances Of launch vehicle technology that later led to Successful missions. An entirely new dimension was added to the Indian space programme when a space capsule was recovered very precisely after it had orbited the Earth for 12 days. The future for launch vehicles in ISRO looks bright with the GSLV MKIII, Which is Currently under development and the pursuit Of Cutting edge technologies Such as reusable launch vehicles and air-breathing propulsion.

AB High energy pulses of a CO(2) laser are focused in a parabolic mirror yielding to a laser-supported detonation. The generated thrust acting on the reflector as a bell nozzle is Studied in multiple Pulse free flight experiments with respect to axial, lateral and angular momentum Coupling. The employment of an ignition pill oil the reflector's axis of symmetry lowering the ignition threshold by several orders of magnitude is found to provide tor a reproducible detonation process. The axial momentum coupling of each Pulse is analyzed with respect to initial lateral of Net and tilt during the flight. High speed analyses of recorded flights indicate that lateral momentum components occur re-centering the thruster oil the beam. Thrust vector steering can be realized by tilt of the ignition pin inside the thruster, thus shifting the detonation. A design model of a laser-driven rocket including a remotely accessible steering gear was developed and tested successfully. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Launch vehicle development; Similitude
AB The Ares I-X Flight Test Vehicle is the first in a series of flight test vehicles that will take the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle design from development to operational capability. Ares I-X is scheduled for a 2009 flight date, early enough in the Ares I design and development process so that data obtained from the flight can impact the design of Ares I before its Critical Design Review. Decisions on Ares I-X scope, flight test objectives, and FTV fidelity were made prior to the Ares I systems requirements being baselined. This was necessary in order to achieve a development flight test to impact the Ares I design. Differences between the Ares I-X and the Ares I configurations are artifacts of formulating this experimental project at an early stage and the natural maturation of the Ares I design process. This paper describes the similarities and differences between the Ares I-X Flight Test Vehicle and the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle. Areas of comparison include the outer mold line geometry, aerosciences, trajectory, structural modes, flight control architecture, separation sequence, and relevant element differences. Most of the outer mold line differences present between Ares I and Ares I-X are minor and will not have a significant effect on overall vehicle performance. The most significant impacts are related to the geometric differences in Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle at the forward end of the stack, These physical differences will cause differences in the flow physics in these areas. Even with these differences, the Ares I-X flight test is poised to meet all five primary objectives and six secondary objectives. Knowledge of what the Ares I-X flight test will provide in similitude to Ares I-as well as what the test will not provide-is important in the continued execution of the Ares I-X mission leading to its flight and the continued design and development of Ares I.

DE Thermoelastic finite element analysis; Composite rocket nozzle; Dynamic
   response
AB The finite element method, in the form of the commercial finite element code ADINA, is used to investigate the dynamic thermostructural response of a composite rocket nozzle throat. ADINA's thermoelastic analysis capability is validated by the comparison of its solution for the thermoelastic response of a thick, homogeneous, cylindrically orthotropic tube heated internally, to an analytical one. The spatially reinforced Carbon-Carbon nozzle throat examined here forms part of a low-erosion solid rocket motor nozzle model that is subjected to structural and thermal loading, with the effects of material ablation being neglected. An initial transient quasi-static thermostructural analysis is performed to determine the validity of the nozzle design, following which, an uncoupled dynamic thermostructural analysis of the nozzle's throat and entrance section for the initial transient phase of the nozzle's operation, is carried out. The results of this analysis are then compared to those of the equivalent transient quasi-static analysis to assess the degree of variance in either solution. It is found that the dynamic response oscillates about the quasi-static response in all cases, and that, in general, the variance in stress magnitudes between the two solution techniques is significant.

DT Article
ID MESOSPHERE
AB The resonance transition P-2-S-2 of the atomic hydrogen (Lyman-alpha emission) is the strongest and most conspicuous feature in the solar EUV spectrum. The Lyman-alpha radiation transfer depends on the resonance scattering from the hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere and on the O-2 absorption. Since the Lyman-alpha extinction in the atmosphere is a measure for the column density of the oxygen molecules, the atmospheric O-2 density and temperature profiles can be calculated thereof. A detector of solar Lyman-alpha radiation was manufactured in the Stara Zagora Department of the Solar-Terrestrial Influences Laboratory (STIL). Its basic part is an ionization camera, filled in with NO. A 60 V power supply is applied to the chamber. The produced photoelectric current from the sensor is fed to a two-channel amplifier, providing analog signal. The characteristics of the Lyman-alpha detector were studied. It passed successfully all tests and the results showed that the so-designed instrument could be used in rocket experiments to measure the Lymanalpha flux. From the measurements of the detector, the Lyman-alpha vertical profile can be obtained. Programs are created to compute the O-2 density, atmospheric power and temperature profiles based on Lymanalpha data. The detector design appertained to ASLAF project (Attenuation of the Solar Lyman-Alpha Flux), a scientific cooperation between STIL-Bul.Acad.Sci., Stara Zagora Department and the Atmospheric Physics Group at the Department of Meteorology (MISU), Stockholm University, Sweden. The joint project was part of the rocket experiment HotPay I, in the ALOMAR eARI Project, EU's 6th Framework Programme, Andoya Rocket Range, Andenes, Norway. The project is partly financed by the Bulgarian Ministry of Science and Education.

AB The number of jet and rocket noise studies has increased in recent years as researchers have sought to better understand aeroacoustic source and radiation characteristics. Although jet and rocket noise is finite-amplitude in nature, little is known about the existence of shock formation and coalescence close to the source. A numerical experiment is performed to propagate finite-amplitude noise and determine the extent of the nonlinearity over short distances with spherical spreading. The noise is filtered to have a haystack shape in the frequency domain, as is typical of such sources. The effect of the nonlinearity is compared in both the temporal and frequency domains as a function of distance. Additionally, the number of zero-crossings and overall sound pressure level is compared at several distances. The results indicate that the center frequency plays a particularly important role in the amount of coalescence and spectral redistribution that occurs. The general applicability of these results to actual near-field finite-amplitude jet and rocket noise experiments is also presented.

AB In spite of the increasing importance of heat treatment technology as a way to retard yellowing in green vegetables and retain postharvest quality, data on rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.) are still absent. The aim of this research was to find an effective combined temperature-time treatment to retard yellowing and to determine how that treatment affects ethylene production in packaged salad rocket leaves. An effective temperature-time heat treatment of dipping leaves in a thermostatically controlled tap water bath at 50 degrees C for 20-40s was found to retard yellowing without damaging rocket leaves. Although heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 30s accelerated ethylene production in packaged rocket leaves, it extended their postharvest life at 8 degrees C from 5 to 10 d, without any appreciable effect on quality attributes.

AB Nanoenergetic gas-generator (NGG) mixtures may have various potential military applications from aircraft fuels to rocket propellants, explosives, and primers. To find reactions generating the highest pressure peak, we studied eight nanoenergetic reactions. The Al/Bi(2)O(3) reaction generated the highest pressure pulse among the eight thermite reactions. We developed a highly efficient, one step process for synthesis of Bi(2)O(3) nanostructured particles. Its use generated about a three times higher peak pressure (similar to 10 MPa) than when using commercial bismuth oxide nanoparticles (3 MPa). The pressure in the vessel rose very rapidly to a peak value for a duration of similar to 0.02 ms and Delta P/Delta t of up to 500 GPa s(-1). Increasing the crystallinity of the bismuth oxide nanoparticles increased the peak gas pressure by 25%. The maximum pressure x volume (PV) value obtained at m = 0.1 g with our synthesized Bi(2)O(3) was 707 Pa m(3) much higher than that reported in the literature (33 Pa m(3)) for the same sample mass. Addition of carbon to the reactant mixtures did not increase the peak pressure. Addition of up to 3 wt.-% of boron to the thermite systems increased the peak pressure by similar to 50%.

DT Article
AB The Indian Space capsule (SRE-1) launched aboard PSLV-C7 rocket, was recovered successfully in the Bay of Bengal on January 22, 2007 after its orbital sojourn of 12 days. Apart from serving as a platform for micro-gravity experiments, SRE-1 demonstrated ISRO's capability in the field of orbital reentry and recovery technologies. Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC SHAR), the Spaceport of India was given the prime responsibility of assessment of mission risk, formulation and execution of safety plans and procedures, design and conduct of trials for validating the mission-critical sub-systems as well as the physical recovery of the capsule. To achieve these objectives, a number of drop tests were designed and conducted by SDSC SHAR involving real time computer network, ground-based tracking and telemetry stations, communication systems, safety and material handling systems, target identification and recovery systems. Dissemination of relevant information and coordination with multiple external organizations such as Indian Coast Guard, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy is an important aspect of these experiments. This paper delineates the methodologies designed and implemented at SDSC SHAR for validating those critical systems whose functionality finally culminated in the Success of the mission, enabling India to join the elite group of nations with reentry module recovery capability.

AB This paper describes design, ground testing, an in-orbit experiment, and a novel in-orbit operation for large deployable antenna reflectors (LDRs). Two LDRs (TX-LDR for transmitting and RX-LDR for receiving) are installed on Engineering Test Satellite VIII (ETS-VIII). The reflector design features that the antenna reflector whose aperture is 13 m in diameter (the mechanical dimension is 19 m x 17 m) consists of 14 basic modules, and each basic module consists of a gold-plated molybdenum mesh, a system of cables, and a deployable frame structures. Several ground tests had been performed using a modular nature to advantage. Prior to the launch of ETS-VIII, we performed an in-orbit deployment experiment using LDREX-2 which consists of seven half-scale modules of LDR, to confirm evaluation accuracy. The LDREX-2 was launched by ARIANE 5 launch vehicle as a piggy-back payload. Deployment characteristics were measured to evaluate the accuracy of analytical prediction obtained by ground deployment testing. ETS-VIII was launched by H-IIA launch vehicle on 18 December 2006. After the successful injection into Geo Synchronous Orbit, the RX-LDR and the TX-LDR were successfully deployed on December 25th and 26th, respectively. We confirmed adequacy of the proposed design and ground verification methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a little over four decades, the Indian Space Program has carved a niche for itself with the unique application driven program oriented towards National development. The end-to-end capability approach of the space projects in the country call for innovative practices and procedures in assuring the quality and reliability of space systems. The System Reliability (SR) efforts initiated at the start of the projects continue during the entire life cycle of the project encompassing design, development, realisation, assembly, testing and integration and during launch. Even after the launch, SR groups participate in the on-orbit evaluation of transponders in communication satellites and camera systems in remote sensing satellites. SR groups play a major role in identification, evaluation and inculcating quality practices in work centres involved in the fabrication of mechanical, electronics and propulsion systems required for Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO's) launch vehicle and spacecraft projects. Also the reliability analysis activities like prediction, assessment and demonstration as well as de-rating analysis, Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and worst-case analysis are carried out by SR groups during various stages of project realisation. These activities provide the basis for project management to take appropriate techno-managerial decisions to ensure that the required reliability goals are met. Extensive test facilities catering to the needs of the space program has been set up. A system for consolidating the experience and expertise gained for issue of standards called product assurance specifications to be used in all ISRO centres has also been established.

AB The knowledge of the flow behavior inside asymmetrically heated channels is of great importance to improve design and performance of regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The modeling of the coolant flow is a challenging task because of its particular features, such as the high wall temperature gradient, the high Reynolds number, the three-dimensional geometry of the passages, and the possible supercritical conditions of the fluid. In the present work, a numerical approach to study the turbulent How of supercritical fluids is presented and validated by comparison with experimental data. Solutions of the supercritical nitrogen flowfield in an asymmetrically heated three-dimensional channel with a high-aspect ratio (channel height-to-width ratio) are presented and discussed. Emphasis is given to the analysis of the peculiar behavior and cooling performance of the supercritical fluid as compared with perfect gas. In particular, a long channel is considered, such that entrance effects are negligible, to analyze in detail wall heat-flux evolution throughout the channel.

AB Drug administration through transdermal delivery is restricted by the top layer of skin, the stratum corneum. One possible solution to overcome the barrier function of the stratum corneum is to employ microneedle arrays. However, detailed theoretical models relating drug-coated microneedles and their geometry to the drug concentration in the blood are limited. This article aims to address this issue by examining the blood concentration profiles for a model drug, insulin, that has been administered via coated microneedles. A mathematical model is introduced and applied to predict theoretical blood concentrations. Furthermore, the insulin concentration was a rocket-shaped needle with a constant up angle of 90 degrees. Also, it has been found that the number of microneedles in an array is the most significant factor in determining maximum insulin concentration in the blood (C(h) (max)). Penetration depth of the microneedle, centre-to-centre spacing and microneedle thickness had a less significant effect on the maximum insulin concentration concentration in the blood. It is envisaged that the current study will help in designing microneedles of optimum size and shape for transdermal drug delivery (C) 2009 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The decomposition kinetics of the kerosene-based rocket propellants RP-1 and RP-2 was studied. For RP-2, decomposition reactions were performed at 375, 400, 425, and 450 degrees C. For RP-1, decomposition reactions were only performed at 450 degrees C because we had previously studied decomposition at 375, 400, and 425 degrees C. All of the decomposition reactions were performed in stainless-steel ampule reactors. At each temperature, the extent of decomposition as a function of time was determined by analyzing the thermally stressed liquid phase by gas chromatography. These data were used to derive global pseudo-first-order rate constants that approximate the overall rate of decomposition for the fuel. For RP-2, the rate constants ranged from 1.33 x 10(-5) s(-1) at 375 degrees C to 5.47 x 10(-4) S(-1) at 450 degrees C. The rate constants for the decomposition of RP-1 are not significantly different in that temperature range. One use of these rate constants is for the design and planning of physical property measurements at high temperatures. On the basis of the amount of time required for 1% of the sample to decompose (t(0.01)), we found that allowable instrument residence times ranged from 15 min at 375 degrees C to 0.3 min at 450 degrees C.

AB This paper investigates the development of fault detection and isolation (FDI) filters for distributed time-delay systems. The notion of a finite unobservability subspace is introduced for distributed time-delay systems and an algorithm for its construction is presented. A bank of residual generators is designed based on our developed geometric framework so that each residual is affected by one fault and is decoupled from the others while the H(infinity) norm of the transfer function between the disturbance and the residual signals are kept at less than a prespecified value. Simulation results for a combustion system in a rocket motor chamber demonstrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed FDI algorithm.

AB Based on the piezoelectric effect, a new type of piezoelectric thrust vector-measuring system for a rocket engine is designed, which is made up of four three-component piezoelectric force sensors, so that 12 output force signals can be generated. Using the theoretical mechanics, the reverse formulas for the thrust vector (namely, the misalignment angle and the offset) are deduced. In order to calibrate the measuring system, a special calibration platform is designed. The calibration results show that the non-linearity and cross talk of the designed piezoelectric thrust vector-measuring system are less than 1 and 5%, respectively. Finally, a practical loading experiment is performed to test the application performance of the thrust vector-measuring system, and the experimental results prove that the thrust vector-measuring system can accurately measure both the magnitude and the direction of the thrust vector.

AB Excluding speculations about future breakthrough discoveries in physics, it is shown that with what is at present known, and also what is technically feasible, manned space flight to the limits of the solar system and beyond deep into the Oort cloud is quite possible. Using deuterium as the rocket fuel of choice, abundantly available on the comets of the Oort cloud, rockets driven by deuterium fusion can there be refuelled. To obtain a high thrust with high specific impulse favours the propulsion by deuterium micro-bombs, and it is shown that the ignition of deuterium micro-bombs is possible by intense GeV proton beams, generated in space by using the entire spacecraft as a magnetically insulated billion volt capacitor. The cost to develop this kind of a propulsion system in space would be very high, but it can also be developed on Earth by a magnetically insulated Super Marx Generator. Since the ignition of deuterium is theoretically possible with the Super Marx Generator, making obsolete the ignition of deuterium-tritium with a laser, where 80% of the energy goes into neutrons, this would also mean a breakthrough in fusion research, and therefore would justify the large development costs.

AB In the present research, we experimentally verified the partial-fill effect in a multicycle pulse detonation rocket engine. The intermittent thrust of a pulse detonation rocket engine was measured by using a spring-damper mechanism that smoothed this intermittent thrust in the time direction. The intermittent mass flow rates were assessed by gas cylinder pressure or mass difference measurement. The maximum specific impulse was 305 +/- 9 s at an ethylene and oxygen propellant fill fraction of 0.130 +/- 0.004. When the fill fraction was greater than 0.130, the specific impulse was increased as the partial-fill fraction was decreased. When the fill fraction was less than 0.130, the specific impulse was sharply decreased as the partial-fill fraction was decreased. This decrease was due to diffusion between propellant and purge gases and the short length of the transition from deflagration to detonation. The multicycle pulse detonation rocket engine had a partial-fill effect that may have been mainly due to the suctioned air and was consistent with the single-cycle partial-fill model of Endo et al.

AB The internal and external flowfield variation of a launch vehicle has been simulated in an e-Science environment. To analyze the igniting process of a solid-rocket propellant, a fluid-structure interaction code has been developed using an ALE (arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) kinematical description and a staggered fluid-structure interaction algorithm. Also, unsteady motion of a detached rocket booster has been predicted by using an external flow analysis with an aerodynamic-dynamic coupled solver. A Korean e-Science environment designed for aerospace engineering, e-AIRS [15], supplies a user-friendly interface for such individual work and it can advance to an integrated rocket simulation of internal combustion and external flow variation by controlling the execution and data flow of two flow solvers. As a consequence, e-Science facilitates multi-disciplinary collaborative research, and makes individual work more convenient.

ID DESIGN
AB The three-axis active attitude control method with a momentum wheel and magnetic coils for a pico-satellite is considered. The designed satellite is a 2.5 kg class satellite stabilized to nadir pointing. The momentum wheel performs a pitch-axis momentum bias, nominally spinning at a particular rate. Three magnetic coils are mounted perpendicularly along the body axis for precise attitude control through the switch control mechanism. Momentum wheel start up control, damping control and attitude acquisition control are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed combined control laws for the pico-satellite is reliable and has an appropriate accuracy under different separation conditions. The proposed strategy to start up the wheel after separation from the launch vehicle shows that its pitch momentum wheel can start up successfully to its nominal speed from rest, and the attitude convergence can be completed within several orbits, depending on separation conditions.

DE pseudospectral method; solid launch vehicle; trajectory optimization;

AB The problem of real-time trajectory optimization for small solid launch vehicle of operational responsive space (ORS) was studied by using pseudospectral method. According to the characteristic of the trajectory design, the dynamics model was set up in the inertia right-angled reference frame, and the equation and parameter at the orbit injection point were simplified and converted. The infinite dimension dynamic optimal control problem was converted to a finite dimension static state optimization problem and the algorithm reduced the complexity so as to become a general algorithm in trajectories optimization. With the trajectories optimization of a three-stage solid vehicle with a liquor upper stage as example, the model of the trajectory optimization was set up and simulations were carried out. The results demonstrated the advantage and validity of the pseudospectral method. The rejection time of fairing was also analyzed by the simulation results, and the optimal flight procedure and trajectory were obtained.

DE trans-aerosphere vehicle X-34; climbing phase; characteristic modeling;
   adaptive control; robustness
AB In this paper, a characteristic model based longitudinal control design for the trans-aerosphere vehicle X-34 in its transonic and hypersonic climbing phase is proposed. The design is based on the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and the curves it is to track in this climbing phase. Through a detailed analysis of the aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics during this climbing phase, an explicit description of the tracking curve for the flight path angle is derived. On the basis of this tracking curve, the tracking curves for the two short-period variables, the angle of attack and the pitch rate, are designed. An all-coefficient adaptive controller is then designed, based on the characteristic modeling, to cause these two short-period variables to follow their respective tracking curves. The proposed design does not require multiple working points, making the design procedure simple. Numerical simulation is performed to validate the performance of the controller. The simulation results indicate that the resulting control law ensures that the vehicle climbs up successfully under the restrictions on the pitch angle and overloading.

AB The quality control of the electrodeposit is one of the keys to extending the application of electroforming technology. In this paper, experimental equipment was developed to electroform revolving parts. The conformal anode, high frequency pulse current and well chosen electrolyte were employed to carry out Ni-Mn alloy electroforming for a model of the rocket nozzle. The reasons why the electrodeposits broke and pores existed in the deposits were found. By adding additives to the electrolyte and improving agitation of the electrolyte, the break and pore of the deposits were eliminated. Finally, the acceptable electroforms were obtained.

AB Current knowledge concerning the lower ionosphere (D- and E-region) is reviewed with an emphasis on new aspects of empirical results. Starting with an overview of experimental techniques and corresponding data bases, both regarding charged as well as the most relevant neutral constituents of this altitude range, the ionospheric variability is discussed both concerning regular (e.g. diurnal and seasonal) as well as irregular variations (e.g. driven by the variability of nitric oxide). We then turn to 'new players' in the lower ionosphere, i.e. charged aerosol particles such as mesospheric ice particles in noctilucent clouds or polar mesospheric summer echoes and meteor smoke particles originating from ablated meteoric matter. These species have received considerable attention in recent years, in part because it is speculated that observations of their properties might be useful for the detection of climate change signals. The available experimental data base regarding these species is reviewed and we show that there is now compelling evidence for the ubiquitous presence of these very heavy charge carriers throughout the lower ionosphere. While many fundamental details regarding these charged species are not yet completely understood, this emphasizes that charged aerosol particles may not be neglected in a comprehensive treatment of the lower ionospheric charge balance and related phenomena. Finally, we close with suggestions for future research.

TI Development of the RFBB "Bargouzine" concept for Ariane-5 evolution
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the study of a concept of Ariane-5 evolution by means of replacement of two solid-propellant boosters EAP with two liquid-propellant reusable fly-back boosters (RFBBs) called "Bargouzine". The main design feature of the reference RFBB is LOX/LH2 propellant, the canard aerodynamic Configuration with delta wings and rocket engines derived from Vulcain-2 identical to that of the central core except for the nozzle length. After separation RFBBs return back by use of air breathing engines mounted in the aft part and then landing on a runway.
   The aim of the study is a more detailed investigation of critical technology issues concerning reliability, re-usability and maintenance requirements. The study was performed in three main phases: system trade-off, technical consolidation, and programmatic synthesis. The system trade-off includes comparative analysis of two systems with three and four engines on each RFBB and determination of the necessary thrust level taking into account thrust reservation for emergency Situations. Besides, this phase contains trade-off on booster aerodynamic Configurations and abort scenario analysis.
   The second phase includes studying of controllability during the ascent phase and separation, thermo-mechanical design, development of ground interfaces and attachment means, and turbojets engine analysis taking into account reusability. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A technique for computationally determining the thermophysical properties of high-energy-density matter (HEDM) propellants is presented. HEDM compounds are of interest in the liquid rocket engine industry due to their high density and high energy content relative to existing industry-standard propellants. In order to accurately model rocket engine performance, cost and weight in a conceptual design environment, several thermodynamic and physical properties are required over a range of temperatures and pressures. The approach presented here combines quantum mechanical and molecular dynamic (MD) Calculations and group additivity methods. A method for improving the force field model coefficients used in the MD is included. This approach is used to determine thermophysical properties for two HEDM compounds of interest: quadricyclane and 2-azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine (DMAZ). The modified force field approach provides results that more accurately match experimental data than the unmodified approach. Launch vehicle and Lunar lander case studies are presented to quantify the system level impact of employing quadricyclane and DMAZ rather than industry standard propellants. In both cases, the use of HEDM propellants provides reductions in vehicle mass compared to industry standard propellants.

SO AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Air-launching rocket; Sequential optimization; System trade study;
   Multi-disciplinary feasible
AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, a comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. For the selection of the best system alternative, a trade study for the first stage engine type and launching speeds is performed using a sequential optimization technique, confirming the feasibility of the baseline air-launching rocket. Then, a system design has been performed using the multi-disciplinary feasible (MDF) design optimization method. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis. configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of multi-disciplinary system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1244.9 kg, total length of 6.36 m, outer diameter of 0.60 m has been successfully designed to launch a satellite of 7.5 kg to the 700 km circular orbit.

TI Comparison of Hot-Fire and Cold-Flow Observations of Nitrogen
   Tetroxide/Monomethylhydrazine Impinging Combustion
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTICAL PATTERNATOR; TRIPLET INJECTORS; JETS; ELEMENTS
AB The combustion phenomena of doublet impingements of nitrogen tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine were observed in this research. The total How rates of the propellants were controlled at similar to 8.00 g/s to simulate the operation of a 5 Ibf rocket, and the ratios of the mass How rates (O/F) of nitrogen tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine were varied from 1.0 to 2.5. With a two-axis translation module, a C-type thermocouple was used to measure the two-dimensional temperature distributions or the flames at 20 mm downstream of their impinging points. The observations showed that induction distances always appeared from the positions of propellants' impingement to ignition, and the ignition was induced by the local concentrations of gaseous monomethylhydrazine. The maximum flame length of similar to 80 mm appeared at the best mixing condition of O/F = 1.2, and diffusion-type flames at higher O/F showed shorter flame lengths for poor mixing after the flames had been ignited. Comparing to the previous cold-flow observations by the planar laser induced fluorescence technique with simulants of water- and chloroform-based solutions to match the densities, viscosities, and surface tensions of monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, the locations of high-temperature zones in hot-fire experiments were adequately described by the calculated two-dimensional temperature distributions from the observed local mixture ratio data at the corresponding ignition positions in the cold-flow experiments. These results inferred that the mixture ratio profile was almost conserved after ignition. That is, by properly analyzing the mass distribution of the cold-flow observation with simulants, the temperature distribution of the impinging combustion of nitrogen tetroxide/monomethylhydrazine can be predicted.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The ablation in solid-propellant rocket nozzle is a coupling process resulted by chemistry, heat and mass transfer. Based on the heat and mass transfer theory, the aero-thermo-dynamic, and thermo-chemical kinetics, the thermal-chemical ablation model is established. Simulations are completed on the heat flow field and chemical ablation in the nozzle with different concentrations, frequency factors and activation energy of H(2). The calculation results show that the concentration and the activation energy of H(2) can provoke the transformation of control mechanism, whereas the influence brought by the frequency factor of H(2) is feeble under a high-temperature and high-pressure combustion circumstance. The discrimination for ablative control mechanism is dependent on both concentration and activation energy of H(2). This study will be useful in handling ablation and thermal protection problem in the design of solid-propellant rocket.

AB The Thunderstorm Energetic Radiation Array (TERA) is located at the University of Florida, Florida Tech International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, Florida. The array includes forty-five 7.6-cm-diameter NaI/photomultiplier tube detectors enclosed in 24 separate aluminum boxes that shield the detectors from light, moisture, and RF noise. The array covers the similar to 1 km(2) ICLRT facility, centered on the rocket launch tower, used to trigger lightning. From 2005 to 2007, TERA recorded seven rocket-triggered lightning flashes. In this paper we present an analysis of the X-ray emission of three of these flashes. The X-ray emission is observed to occur during the dart leader phase of each stroke, just prior to the time of the return stroke. Significant X-rays are observed on all the detectors to a distance of 500 m from the lightning channel for times up to 200 mu s prior to the start of the return stroke. Using Monte Carlo simulations to model the X-ray propagation, we find that the energetic electrons that emit the X-rays have a characteristic energy of about 1 MeV for one particular dart-stepped leader event. The X-ray emission for all three events has a radial fall off proportional to [exp (-r/120)]/r and is most consistent with the energetic source electrons being emitted isotropically from the leader. It is also found that the X-ray and energetic electron luminosities of the leader channel decreases with increasing height above the ground. These results help shed light onto the mechanism for producing energetic radiation from lightning. For instance, a characteristic energy of 1 MeV is not consistent with the relativistic runaway electron avalanche mechanism, suggesting that so-called cold runaway electrons, produced by very strong electric fields, dominate the production of the X-rays.

AB The 'particles-in-a-box' (PIB) model introduced by Talent [Talent, D.L. Analytic model for orbital debris environmental management. J. Spacecraft Rocket, 29 (4), 508-513, 1992.] removed the need for computer-intensive Monte Carlo simulation to predict the gross characteristics of an evolving debris environment. The PlB model was described using a differential equation that allows the stability of the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment to be tested by a straightforward analysis of the equation's coefficients. As part of an ongoing research effort to investigate more efficient approaches to evolutionary modelling and to develop a suite of educational tools, a new PlB model has been developed. The model, entitled Fast Debris Evolution (FADE), employs a first-order differential equation to describe the rate at which new objects >= 10 cm are added and removed from the environment. Whilst Talent [Talent, D.L. Analytic model for orbital debris environmental management. J. Spacecraft Rocket, 29 (4), 508-513, 1992.] based the collision theory for the PlB approach on collisions between gas particles and adopted specific values for the parameters of the model from a number of references, the form and coefficients of the FADE model equations can be inferred from the outputs of future projections produced by high-fidelity models, such as the DAMAGE model.
   The FADE model has been implemented as a client-side, web-based service using JavaScript embedded within a HTML document. Due to the simple nature of the algorithm, FADE can deliver the results of future projections immediately in a graphical format, with complete user-control over key simulation parameters. Historical and future projections for the >= 10 cm. LEO debris environment under a variety of different scenarios are possible, including business as usual, no future launches, post-mission disposal and remediation. A selection of results is presented with comparisons with predictions made using the DAMAGE environment model. The results demonstrate that the FADE model is able to capture comparable time-series of collisions and number of objects as predicted by DAMAGE in several scenarios. Further, and perhaps more importantly, its speed and flexibility allows the user to explore and understand the evolution of the space debris environment. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper is concerned with the response of confined low-Reynolds-number jets to external modulations of large amplitudes. The jet formed inside a duct by an orifice plate is submitted to flow perturbations impinging on the constriction from the upstream side. Vortices are generated in the downstream region, giving rise to conversion from acoustic oscillation to convective modes. Experiments and simulations are carried out to characterize this important mode conversion process. It is shown that the convective perturbation phase is a linear function of the distance from the orifice plate and of the operating frequency. Data can be collapsed into a single curve with some scatter providing a scaling rule for the phase. Numerical simulations are carried out and a method is developed to decompose the local velocity perturbations into acoustic and convective components. This is used to determine the amplitudes of upstream and downstream acoustic velocities and of the convective perturbations on the downstream side of the orifice. It is shown that the acoustic velocity approximated by a bulk oscillation in the orifice vicinity is reduced at the constriction and that this is simultaneously compensated by the generation of convective perturbations. The conversion efficiency of this process is characterized. Results obtained can be used to design How control devices; they provide insight into the generation of vortices in orifice plate systems submitted to large pressure oscillations and could be useful to the analysis of vortex instabilities in segmented solid rocket engines.

AB With the objective of evaluating the effect of different substrates in the production of vegetable biomass on rocket (Eruca sativa) seedlings cv. cultivated, an experiment was carried out at the Federal University of Acre, in the period from September to November of 2006, using the following treatments: T(1) -Plantmax (R) (control), T(2) -organic compost + triturated ripe coconut shells (1: 1 v/v), T(3) -organic compost + poultry litter + carbonized rice hulls (1: 1: 1 v/v), T(4) -organic compost + bovine manure + carbonized rice hulls (1: 1: 1 v/v), T(5) -organic compost + earthworm casting + carbonized rice hulls (1: 1: 1 v/v), T(6) -organic compost + earthworm casting + triturated a a pit (1: 1: 1 v/v), T(7) -organic compost + earthworm casting + triturated ripe coconut shells (1: 1: 1 v/v) e T (8) -organic compost + bovine manure + triturated ripe coconut shells (1: 1: 1 v/v). Ten percent triturated charcoal, 1.0 kg.m(-3) of lime and 1.5 kg.m(-3) of thermophosphate were added, except in T(1) treatment. The sowing was done using three seeds per cell in expanded polystyrene trays containing the different substrates. Eight days after sowing, thinning was done leaving just 1 plant per cell. On the 26th day after sowing, the fresh mass of the aerial part, the dry mass of the aerial part, root, and the whole plant were appraised. The experimental design was entirely randomized with 8 treatments and 3 repetitions, and with 4 plants per plot. Treatments T(4), T(5) and T(7) were the ones that promoted a higher yield of fresh and dry plant mass, and did not differ statistically among themselves, nor from the control treatment (T(1)), for all the characteristics evaluated.

AB The design of the CAPE I satellite was underway for approximately three years. This interdisciplinary project incorporates electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineering, as well as computer science and physics. The project hoped to teach students how to design, develop, and maintain a lower Earth orbiting satellite. This satellite was delivered to San Luis Obispo, California, December 5, 2006, where it passed the final integration test in order to qualify for launch. After qualification, the satellite was loaded into the poly-picosatellite orbital deployer or P-POD, which is the deployment system for the satellite. The P-POD holds three CubeSats. Once all three satellites were integrated, it was delivered to Kazakhstan and loaded into the DNEPR Russian Rocket on March 17, 2007. After a few delays, the rocket was launched on April 17,2007. The team is currently monitoring and decoding the CW beacons transmitted by the satellite.
   The project was broken into several subsystems including mechanical, communications, control and data handling, and power. Each of the systems proved to have their own unique challenges. Being that the majority of the team was electrical engineering students, the mechanical subsystem presented the most difficulty.
   There is currently a design in progress for the next satellite project, CAPE II. This new satellite will attempt a new benchmark by incorporating more advanced technologies than CAPE I and include other campus entities such as The Wetlands Research Center. The team hopes to deploy buoys into the Gulf of Mexico that will communicate to the CAPE II satellite in space and then send data to the ground station at the University. This data will include subjects such as coastal erosion, water temperatures, and drift currents throughout the Gulf. With this data, we can give other organizations the information obtained for their use as well.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center's E-3 test facility.

AB Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center's E-3 test facility.

AB Since more than twenty five years, composite materials have been with continuously increasing spatial and aeronautical applications requirements. The thermostructural composites materials are of utmost importance for satisfying the needs of mechanical and thermal characteristics at very high temperature and in severe environments. This paper deals with a large variety of applications concerning the aerospace and nuclear applications like nozzles and hot gas valves for Solid Rocket Motor (SRM), brake disks for planes, aerospace turbine engine exhaust nozzles, thermal protection system for reentry vehicles, but also Divert and Attitude Control System (DACS) for interceptors, heat exchangers for hypersonic propulsion systems, plasma facing components for nuclear fusion applications and special components for nuclear fission applications. We will see that Carbon/Carbon and Ceramic Matrix Composites are leading candidate materials for these high-temperature structural applications. This lecture will identify the current state-of-the-art and new technological developments. A description of the main steps of the manufacturing processes will be made.

AB The US is entering into a new era in space. The Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) (Bush. 2004) announced by the US President has been fleshed out during the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) (ESAS Team Final Report, 2005) and work has been underway since then to develop a generation of launch vehicles to implement the preferred 1.5 launch architecture identified in the study The 0 5 part of the launch set indicates the smaller Crew Launch Vehicle in the new set designated Ares I by NASA. The Ares I was selected by the team because analysis had shown that its complement of a solid first stage, with a liquid H(2)/O(2) cryogenic second stage offered the best potential balance among cost, risk and performance In particular the risk that this conceptual design would impose on the crew once matured was forecasted to be an order of magnitude better than the current matured crewed launcher set, the Soyuz and the Space Shuttle (Isakowitz, 2004). This forecast relied heavily oil the experience of the heritage systems upon which the concept was based, specifically the heritage of the Shuttle solid rocket boosters and the experience with cryogenic upper stage engines from the Apollo and Shuttle era. Even with this strong heritage in play, it was recognized by the ESAS Risk Analysts that it would be necessary to mature the design with a set of test flights prior to placing the crew at risk. However the question was and is. "How many test flights are necessary before a crewed flight should be attempted?"
   This is the question that this paper addresses That is, it is clear that the number of test flights is related to the desired safety level and that this, in turn, is related to what safety goal should be assigned to enable the crewed flight. Further, demonstration of goal achievement is again in turn related to how much of the heritage base can be captured in the new design In the extreme, for a completely "new" design, the demonstration would be bounded by the requirements of the identical, repeatable experiments of classical probability theory (Mises, 1957). Even if the tens, or even hundreds of launches that this would require would be financially possible, tests of developmental systems are seldom, if ever, identical and repeatable because the design is modified to address the failure events observed. On the other hand, if the design was completely identical to the heritage then the heritage demonstrated reliability could be subsumed compared to the goal without further testing. This paper addresses the role of heritage in a developmental environment in the establishment of a minimum goal for the initiation of crewed missions and the testing required for its demonstration (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The authors present a new method for predicting combustion instabilities in liquid rocket engines. This method is based on the solution of the linearized governing equations for a three-dimensional combustor geometry in the time domain. The aim of this paper is to show the general feasibility of the approach and to explain the general behavior of the model. The computational domain comprises the combustion chamber itself and the convergent part of the nozzle. The heat release is included via a source term in the linearized energy equation. In the example of the European Aestus engine, it is shown that the model is able to predict the different oscillation modes without any preliminary assumptions about them. An analysis of the influence of the nozzle illustrates that its behavior is automatically included in the approach by design. In comparison to the solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations, the method has the advantage of a much lower numerical cost.

AB This paper deals with the problem of the instability regions of a free-free flexible jointed bipartite beam under the follower and transversal forces as a realistic simulation of a two-stage aerospace structure. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of the characteristics of a flexible joint on the beam instability to use maximum bearable propulsion force. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of the stiffness and the location of the joint on the critical follower force by the Ritz method and the Newmark method, then to research the vibrational properties of the structure. It has been shown that the nature of instability is quite unpredictable and dependent on the stiffness and the location of the joint. The increase of the follower force or the transversal force will increase the vibration of the model and consequently cause a destructive phenomenon in the control system of the aerospace structure. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new concept of the parametric approach to analyze the characteristics effects of a flexible two-stage aerospace structure joint design.

AB This paper deals with the problem of the instability regions of a free-free flexible jointed bipartite beam under the follower and transversal forces as a realistic simulation of a two-stage aerospace structure. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of the characteristics of a flexible joint on the beam instability to use maximum bearable propulsion force. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of the stiffness and the location of the joint on the critical follower force by the Ritz method and the Newmark method, then to research the vibrational properties of the structure. It has been shown that the nature of instability is quite unpredictable and dependent on the stiffness and the location of the joint. The increase of the follower force or the transversal force will increase the vibration of the model and consequently cause a destructive phenomenon in the control system of the aerospace structure. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new concept of the parametric approach to analyze the characteristics effects of a flexible two-stage aerospace structure joint design.

AB Turbopumps which pressurize fuels and oxidizers are generally used to operate liquid rocket engine for space launch vehicles. It is considered very important to predict fatigue properties at elevated temperatures for the design and manufacturing of reliable turbopump systems. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is one of the most promising manufacturing methods for gas turbine rotors. In this research, five kinds of Ni-based superalloys (Inconel 718 HIP, Inconel 718 HIP and heat treated, MAR-M-247 HIP. MAR-M-247 HIP and heat treated and Rene 95 HIP) were investigated at elevated temperatures. Original universal slopes method, modified universal slopes method, Mitchell's method, Baumel and Seeger's method, and Ong's method have been used for predicting the high temperature low-cycle fatigue performance. Among these methods, Mitchell's method showed the best adaptation results for the life prediction of Ni-based HIP superalloys. A novel equation was suggested by modification of Mitchell's method to predict Ni-based HIP superalloys at elevated temperature more accurately. The equation predicted well the low-cycle fatigue of HIP superalloys as well as of cast Rene 80 at elevated temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A free-standing space elevator structure: A practical alternative to the
   space tether
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Review
DE Space elevator; Cantilevered beam; Pneumatic structure
AB Space tethers have been investigated widely as a means to provide easy access to space. However, the design and construction of such a device presents significant unsolved technological challenges. We propose an alternative approach to the construction of a space elevator that utilizes a free-standing core structure to provide access to near space regions and to reduce the cost of space launch. The structure is comprised of pneumatically inflated sections that are actively controlled and stabilized to balance external disturbances and support the structure. Such an approach avoids problems associated with a space tether including material strength constraints, the need for in-space construction, the fabrication of a cable at least 50,000 km in length, and the ageing and meteorite-damage effects associated with a thin tether or cable in Low Earth Orbit. An example structure constructed at 5 km altitude and extending to 20 km above sea level is described. The stability and control of the structure, methods for construction and its utility for space launch and other applications are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic optimization of electromechanical coupling system is a significant engineering problem in the field of mechatronics. The performance improvement of electromechanical equipment depends on the system design parameters. Aiming at the spindle unit of refitted machine tool for solid rocket, the vibration acceleration of tool is taken as objective function, and the electromechanical system design parameters are appointed as design variables. Dynamic optimization model is set up by adopting Lagrange-Maxwell equations, Park transform and electromechanical system energy equations. In the procedure of seeking high efficient optimization method, exponential function is adopted to be the weight function of particle swarm optimization algorithm. Exponential inertia weight particle swarm algorithm(EPSA), is formed and applied to solve the dynamic optimization problem of electromechanical system. The probability density function of EPSA is presented and used to perform convergence analysis. After calculation, the optimized design parameters of the spindle unit are obtained in limited time period. The vibration acceleration of the tool has been decreased greatly by the optimized design parameters. The research job in the paper reveals that the problem of dynamic optimization of electromechanical system can be solved by the method of combining system dynamic analysis with reformed swarm particle optimization. Such kind of method can be applied in the design of robots, NC machine, and other electromechanical equipments.

AB We have recently introduced several important improvements in the measurement of distillation Curves of complex fluids, The modifications to the classical measurement provide for (1) a composition-explicit data channel for each distillate fraction (for qualitative, quantitative, and trace analysis): (2) temperature measurements that are true thermodynamic state points that can be modeled with an equation of state; (3) temperature, volume, and pressure measurements Of low uncertainty Suitable for equation of state development (4) consistency with a century of historical data; (5) an assessment of the energy content of each distillate fraction and (6) a corrosivity assessment of each distillate fraction. We hive applied the new method to the measurement of rocket propellant, gasolines, jet fuels, and hydrocarbon crude oils. In this paper. we present the application of the technique to representative batches of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) and mixtures of this diesel fuel with two of the more promising oxygenating agents; namely, dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate. The addition of oxygenates, although more familiar in gasoline fuel systems, is also of great interest in the diesel fuel community, since it provides an opportunity to decrease particulate emissions. The potential of designing new fuel mixtures critically depends oil knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the fluids. The volatility, its provided by the distillation curve method we apply, is part of that knowledge base. We present herein the distillation curves its a function of additive starting concentration and the concurrent analytical information. We noted that even after the oxygenates have distilled out of the mixtures. there is a persistent depression in the temperature. Ail explanation in terms of the Helmholtz free energy equation of state model is advanced.

AB The Hubble Space Telescope has been the most successful space astronomy project to date, producing images that put the public in awe and images and spectra that have produced many scientific discoveries. It is the natural culmination of a dream envisioned when rocket flight into space was first projected and a goal set for the US space program soon after NASA was created. The design and construction period lasted almost two decades and its operations have already lasted almost as long. The capabilities of the observatory have evolved and expanded with periodic upgrading of its instrumentation, thus realizing the advantages of its unique design. The success of this long-lived observatory is closely tied to the availability of the Space Shuttle and the end of the Shuttle program means that the end of the Hubble program will follow before long.

AB This paper describes the results of a sounding rocket experiment which was partly dedicated to study the heat transfer from a hot wall to a cold liquid with a free surface. Natural or buoyancy-driven convection does not occur in the compensated gravity environment of a ballistic phase. Thermo-capillary convection driven by a temperature gradient along the free surface always occurs if a non-condensable gas is present. This convection increases the heat transfer compared to a pure conductive case. Heat transfer correlations are needed to predict temperature distributions in the tanks of cryogenic upper stages. Future upper stages of the European Ariane V rocket have mission scenarios with multiple ballistic phases. The aims of this paper and of the COMPERE group (French-German research group on propellant behavior in rocket tanks) in general are to provide basic knowledge, correlations and computer models to predict the thermo-fluid behavior of cryogenic propellants for future mission scenarios. Temperature and surface location data from the flight have been compared with numerical calculations to get the heat flux from the wall to the liquid. Since the heat flux measurements along the walls of the transparent test cell were not possible, the analysis of the heat transfer coefficient relies therefore on the numerical modeling which was validated with the flight data. The coincidence between experiment and simulation is fairly good and allows presenting the data in form of a Nusselt number which depends on a characteristic Reynolds number and the Prandtl number. The results are useful for further benchmarking of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes such as FLOW-3D and FLUENT, and for the design of future upper stage propellant tanks.

AB This paper describes the experimental strategy developed to improve the modeling of liquid-vapor flows during the chill down of rocket engines by cryogenic fluid in microgravity. A similarity analysis is performed to determine the relevant dimensionless numbers for the design of an experiment similar to engine flows. A literature review on reduced gravity quenching experiments, and on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer shows the lack of validated models for microgravity. Experimental results obtained with the quenching of a glass tube by FC72 during parabolic flight are presented. Especially the impact of gravity and subcooling on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer is investigated. Results show an increase in rewetting temperature, and a decrease in film boiling heat transfer under reduced gravity in agreement with the literature. The comparison of 0 g flow pattern with corresponding tests on ground points out a behavior at 0 g closest to 1 g upflow than 1 g downflow.

AB Current developments in the aerospace Right devices have led to a control system being designed in the presence of elastic behaviour. However, there are several ways to reduce the destructive effects of vibration in flexible systems. In this paper, a practical approach called 'rigid model reference' is extended to two vibration modes based on the gradient method. Furthermore, the existence of two dominant bending vibration modes in the output of measurement devices leads to a redesign of the control system. Robust stability of the new algorithm is investigated by using Kharitonov theorem. Simulation results illustrate considerable reduction of vibration effects on the output of measurement system considering the first and the second bending vibration modes.

AB IBEX provides the observations needed for detailed modeling and in-depth understanding of the interstellar interaction (McComas et al. in Physics of the Outer Heliosphere, Third Annual IGPP Conference, pp. 162-181, 2004; Space Sci. Rev., 2009a, this issue). From mission design to launch and acquisition, this goal drove all flight system development. This paper describes the management, design, testing and integration of IBEX's flight system, which successfully launched from Kwajalein Atoll on October 19, 2008. The payload is supported by a simple, Sun-pointing, spin-stabilized spacecraft with no deployables. The spacecraft bus consists of the following subsystems: attitude control, command and data handling, electrical power, hydrazine propulsion, RF, thermal, and structures. A novel 3-step orbit approach was employed to put IBEX in its highly elliptical, 8-day final orbit using a Solid Rocket Motor, which provided large delta-V after IBEX separated from the Pegasus launch vehicle; an adapter cone, which interfaced between the SRM and Pegasus; Motorized Lightbands, which performed separation from the Pegasus, ejection of the adapter cone, and separation of the spent SRM from the spacecraft; a ShockRing isolation system to lower expected launch loads; and the onboard Hydrazine Propulsion System. After orbit raising, IBEX transitioned from commissioning to nominal operations and science acquisition. At every phase of development, the Systems Engineering and Mission Assurance teams supervised the design, testing and integration of all IBEX flight elements.

AB Spray combustors are now widely used in many technologies, spanning commodity chemical synthesis (combustion of molten sulfur en route to sulfuric acid (H(2)SO(4)) and phosphorus en route to phosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)), ... ), and nanoparticle synthesis (eg., via "spray pyrolysis"), to energy conversion (oil-fired furnaces or boilers) and chemical propulsion (aircraft gas turbines and liquid-propellant rocket motors). While important space, weight, and pollutant constraints inevitably differ from application to application, spray-"fuel"-fed combustors share certain common performance characteristics, and there is a considerable economic incentive to develop rational yet tractable design methods for them. While this intrinsically interdisciplinary Subject continues to evolve, here, we briefly review sonic of the principal contributions to these challenging goals published by chemical engineers since the inception of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry (I&EC). Not surprisingly, the earliest contributions focused oil some of the important "unit processes" (e.g., isolated droplet evaporation rates, vapor micromixing rates in spatially homogeneous turbulent flows, and steady vapor-phase laminar diffusion flames). Chemical engineers introduced "continuous mixture theory" to economically address not only phase/chemical equilibria in multicomponent mixtures, but also spatially nonuniform (nonequilibrium) flows. More-recent studies have introduced diffusion "flamelet" concepts for vapor-phase nonpremixed combustion and statistical population-balance concepts to address evolving turbulence characteristics and/or droplet size distributions. Because of the wide range of operative (length and time) scales in the full problem, in the foreseeable future, clever asymptotic methods will continue to be required to capture the essential physicochemical phenomena but still make the associated numerical simulations manageable. In this regard, a fruitful unified perspective is now emerging-one quite natural to chemical engineers. This can perhaps be best described as an interacting "multi-phase, multi-environment" approach-or simply an "interacting multivariable population balance" approach. While much remains to be done, it is hoped that this 2008/2009 perspective, and highly selective "review" Of but one class of multiphase chemical reactors, will stimulate further activity along this promising path,

   really "chemical reaction engineering", and who later championed the
   application of population balance and moment methods in the emerging
   field of "aerosol reaction engineering".

AB The space cable consists of evacuated tubes supported by fast-moving objects, called bolts, travelling inside them. The bolts are connected to the tubes via permanent magnets stabilized electronically for minimal power consumption. Version 1 was designed to replace the role of a first-stage rocket by lifting space vehicles from the ground to 50 pkm at 5800km/h. Version 2 rises to 140km and has wider applications. Comparable proposals include the space fountain and the launch loop. In the long term, such a fixed infrastructure is more economical than rockets.
   A key issue with these dynamically supported structures is lateral stability, particularly in the presence of varying cross winds in the stratosphere. The relevant partial differential equations are derived below with a set of solutions. A proposal is presented for providing stability by means of tethers, pipes, and a support structure at each end. Each support is a miniature space cable rising to 15km, and it bears the load of the tethers and pipes that would otherwise have to be carried by the main structure. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Because of their unique ablative properties, many carbon-based heterogeneous materials are used as components for thermal protection of systems used at extreme temperatures. such as atmospheric re-entry shields and rocket nozzles. Among other issues, the design of such systems relies critically on the knowledge of surface roughness evolution. This paper gives a synthetic view of an approach of ablation, either by oxidation or by sublimation, which is started from the material point of view. First, the morphology is studied: various features and scales of roughness are presented, and a classification is proposed. Second, a modelling strategy is built. It is based on the competition between bulk and heterogeneous transfer, with possible reactivity contrasts between the material constituents. Numerical results at various scales are given. Some predicted morphologies are in correct agreement with the experimental observations. A parameter variation study shows that the morphological features are dictated by the reactivity contrast of the material components, and by diffusion/reaction competitions. This allows to identify physico-chemical parameters from the roughness geometry, as in an inverse method. The approach is validated quantitatively in the case of the oxidation of a 3D C/C composite.

AB JP-7 is a hydrocarbon-based kerosene fraction with a low volatility and high thermal stability. JP-7 was developed in the 1950s to meet the more stringent requirements necessary for the development of high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that fly at speeds exceeding Much 3. The extreme temperatures encountered due to the heat transmitted from compressed air on the aircraft, and air resistance, required the development of fuels with improved thermal stability and higher flash points. Although JP-7 also meets the operational demands for hypersonic aircraft (Much 5+), this fluid is no longer produced. Currently, there is a desire in the hypersonic vehicle community to replace JP-7 with the rocket propellant RP-2 however, research and testing is necessary to determine whether this substitution will be possible. In this paper, we apply the advanced distillation curve method to a representative sample of the hypersonic vehicle fuel JP-7. Specifically, we present the thermodynamically consistent distillation Curve and use the composition channel to characterize the Curve in terms of composition and available energy content. We then compare the results with previous measurements performed on the rocket propellants RP-1 and RP-2. This work provides a basis of comparison among these fuels in terms of the fundamental thermophysical properties. This comparison will be critical in determining the applicability of substitute fuels and the refinement of future fuels for hypersonic vehicles.

AB Current from nearby rocket-triggered lightning that flowed through the soil and into an unenergized test power distribution line was studied based on experimental data acquired in 2003 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Florida. The 15-pole, three-phase line was 812 m long, was equipped with four arrester stations, at poles 2, 6, 10, and 14, and was terminated in its characteristic impedance at poles I and 15. The neutral conductor of the line was grounded at each arrester station and at both line terminations. Measurements suggest that a significant fraction of the lightning current injected into the earth a distance of 11 in from pole 15 entered the line through the grounding system of pole 15. The peak value of the microsecond-scale return stroke current entering the line through the pole 15 line ground was 7% of the peak value of the return stroke current injected into the earth. The peak value of the millisecond-scale triggered lightning initial stage current and the millisecond-scale return-stroke and initial-stage charge transfer to the line through the pole 15 line ground was between 12% and 19% of the lightning peak current/charge transfer, indicating that the percentage values for the injected peak currents are dependent on the current waveshape: for microsecond-scale return stroke currents, possibly due to electromagnetic coupling effects, a smaller fraction of the current peak enters the line compared to millisecond-scale initial stage currents. In the latter case, any influence of electromagnetic coupling to the line on ground currents is expected to be negligible.

TI Effect of Chamber Backpressure on Swirl Injector Fluid Mechanics
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Fluid mechanics of a liquid swirl injector element at various chamber backpressures were investigated. The center-jet swirling element was designed using typical liquid propellant rocket engine parameters, then manufactured and tested in a high-pressure, optically accessible, cold flow facility. Water was injected into a chamber pressurized with gaseous nitrogen at a constant swirl injector How rate of 0.09 kg/s. The chamber backpressure ranged from 0.10 to 4.81 MPa. The film thickness and spray angle near the nozzle exit were measured by shadowgraphy. The film thickness was also measured within the injector upstream of the exit through a transparent nozzle tube section. Increasing the chamber backpressure for this fixed mass How rate increased the film thickness from predicted design values. Measured discharge coefficient values increased with increasing chamber backpressure, reflecting the observed increase in internal nozzle film thickness. The spray angle decreased for increasing chamber backpressure.

TI Robust Design Optimization by First Design Method
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Launch vehicles are subjected to severe vibratory conditions during takeoff and flight ascent. The loads are not well known at the very beginning of a project, and, even at the end, some uncertainties still prevail. In spite of this, the preliminary design has to be robust with regard to the vibration levels encountered at the payload/launch vehicle interface. This paper presents a new robust design methodology called the First Design Method. This methodology has been applied to a typical launch vehicle excited by a low-frequency transient load. The First Design Method optimizes the natural frequencies of the structural configuration of interest and, subsequently, designs the structural configuration with the modes provided by the optimization procedure. Furthermore, the method, which is based on energy conservation for integrating uncertainties about excitation, is compliant with the laws of physics. In the industrial case investigated in this paper, the First Design Method has been used to design a typical launch vehicle with a very satisfactory behavior as far as the mass and vibration levels at the payload/launch vehicle interface are concerned.

TI Reliability Improvement of a Solid Rocket Motor in Early Design Phases
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
ID STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY; RESPONSE-SURFACE
AB Designing a reliable system is difficult and costly, due to the design process to be followed and test requirements. It is important to consider reliability in very early design phases, and it is essential to select a baseline design with attainable high reliability. Therefore, in early phases, it is required to predict reliability and evaluate possible improvements for the reliability of the design alternatives in a fast manner to make necessary design decisions. In this study, a solid rocket motor is considered as a case study, and it is aimed to determine important parameters that affect the solid rocket motor reliability, to assess ballistic performance and casing structural reliability, and to find a new design point to evaluate possible improvement range for its reliability. The variations in dimensions and material properties, which are obtained from the previous data, are considered as the sources of failures and the limit states for acceleration, and the total impulse and the maximum stress in the casing are approximated by the response surface method. Monte Carlo simulation is used with the response surface functions to assess the failure probability and distributions of the rocket motor performance parameters. By considering the effect of the input parameters and distribution functions of the performance parameters, a new design point is proposed to decrease the total probability of failure.

A test facility developed for the present study can handle kerosene in a temperature range of 300-1000 K, a pressure range of 2.6-5 MPa, and a mass How rate range of 10-100 g/s. In addition, the test section was uniquely designed such that both the wall temperature and the bulk fuel temperature were measured at the same location along the flowpath. The measured temperature distributions were then used to analytically deduce the local heat transfer characteristics. A 10-component kerosene surrogate was proposed and employed to calculate the fuel thermodynamic and transport properties that were required in the heat transfer analysis. Results revealed drastic changes in the fuel flow properties and heat transfer characteristics when kerosene approached its critical state. Convective heat transfer enhancement was also found as kerosene became supercritical. The heat transfer correlation in the relatively low-fuel-temperature region yielded a similar result to other commonly used jet fuels, such as JP-7 and JP-8, at compressed liquid states. In the high-fuel-temperature region, near and beyond the critical temperature, heat transfer enhancement was observed; hence, the associated correlation showed a more significant Reynolds number dependency.

AB This work describes the methodology developed to optimize the design of the combustion chamber, the thrust generating nozzle and the cooling system of a micro-rocket using numerical simulations. The coupling between combustion, subsonic/sonic/supersonic flow transition and heat transfer inside the micro-rocket is analysed using a problem decomposition strategy and state-of-the-art numerical techniques. First, the design of the thrust-generating nozzle is optimized; then, the mixing performances and the combustion efficiency are evaluated; finally, the design of the cooling system is verified calculating the heat transfer from the hot gases to the solid shell and to the cooling fluid. Results show that sub-optimal micro-rocket design alternatives can be easily identified through self-validated numerical analyses. In this way, the number of time consuming and costly experiments required for prototypes qualification in the lab can be reduced, focusing the tests on the limited set of sub-optimal alternatives identified by numerical simulations, thus speeding up the development of new devices.

AB Two experiments were conducted in the vegetable garden of the Department of Plant Sciences of the University of the Semi-Arid (UFERSA), Mossoro-RN, Brazil; the first was carried out from June to August 2005 and second in the period September-October 2005, to evaluate the influence of different spacing on two planting times on the yield performance of rocket. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with treatments arranged in a factorial 3 x 4 with four replications. The treatments consisted of a combination of three row spacing (20, 25 and 30cm) with four spacing within rows (5, 6, 7 and 10cm). The evaluated characteristics were: plant height, number of leaves per plant, shoots dry weight and yield of green mass. No significant interaction between planting times and spacing was observed for plant height, number of leaves per plant and dry weight of shoot. However, significant effect of planting times was observed in the three characteristics evaluated and of spacing in the number of leaves per plant and in the dry weight of shoot. There was significant interaction between planting times and spacing for yield of green mass of rocket. The best agronomic performances of rocket were observed in the second planting time in spacings 0,25 m x 0,05 m; 0,25 m x 0,06 m; 0,25 m x 0,07 m e 0,30 m x 0,06 m. The second time of planting was better than the first.

DE Rocket nozzle; Free shock separation; Restricted shock separation;
   Separation jump; Side-load
AB During development tests of the LE-7A prototype engine, severe side-loads were observed. The side-load peaks appeared only in certain limited conditions during start-up and shut-down transients. To investigate phenomena causing those severe side-loads observed in the LE-7A prototype engine nozzle, series of cold-flow tests and hot-firing tests as well as CFD analyses were conducted. As a result of the hot-firing tests, two different phenomena were found to cause severe side-loads in the LE-7A prototype engine nozzle. One was a restricted shock separation (RSS) flow structure and the other was a phenomenon termed "separation jump," the rapid movement of the separation location in the vicinity of the step. A step was installed in the LE-7A prototype to supply film-cooling gas. Hot-firing test results showed that RSS can occur for a limited mixture ratio. Detailed flow structure of RSS on the nozzle surface was revealed by the cold-flow tests. Measured pressures and visualized images of cold-flow tests clarified the mechanism causing the separation jump. The key phenomenon ruling the separation jump was found to be the base flow behind the step. Based on the results of the present study, the latest LE-7A engine nozzle design has been changed to eliminate the severe side-load.

TI ELV: Pressure-fed LOx/LH2 upper stage
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Cries is leading extensive studies for the future generation of ELVs. The trend is today to research easy to use, robust and reliable solutions for the propulsion of future expendable launch vehicles but also with a high level of performances associated to as low as possible recurring cost of the launch vehicle. Among the different configurations (i.e. "linear", linear with SRBs, tri stages, parallel with cross feeding) conventional two stage architecture seems the one of the best to reach these goals. In the two stage configuration, there is competition between SRB (500ton of propellant), LOx/LH2 (350ton of propellant) or even LOx/methane, but always the second stage is cryotechnic (LH2/LOx), different technological solutions are possible.
   A way could be an extensive use of composite materials both for the structures, the tanks and the engines with use, as much as possible of automatic processes. In near future breakthrough or improvement of the fiber strength may increase the interest of such technologies.
   The aim of this paper is to present the technical choices for 40ton of propellant second stage leading to cost effective configuration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SCHEME
AB A simplified design and optimization method of aerospike nozzle contour and the results of tests and numerical simulation of aerospike nozzles are presented. The primary nozzle contour is approximated by two circular arcs and a parabola; the plug contour is approximated by a parabola and a third-order polynomial. The maximum total impulse from sea level to design altitude is adopted as objective to optimize the aerospike nozzle contour. Experimental studies were performed on a 6-cell tile-shaped aerospike nozzle, a 1-cell linear aerospike nozzle and a 3-cell aerospike nozzle with round-to-rectangle (RTR) primary nozzles designed by method proposed in present paper. Three aerospike nozzles achieved good altitude compensation capacities in the tests and still had better performance at off-design altitudes compared with that of the bell-shaped nozzle. In cold-flow tests, 6-cell tile-shaped aerospike nozzle and 1-cell linear aerospike nozzle obtained high thrust efficiency at design altitude. Employing gas H-2/gas 02 (GH(2)/GO(2)) as propellants, hot-firing tests were carried out on a 3-cell aerospike nozzle engine with RTR primary nozzles. The performance was obtained under two nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) lower than design altitude. Efficiency reached 92.0-93.5% and 95.0-96.0%, respectively. Pressure distribution along plug ramp was measured and the effects of variation in the amount of base bleed on performance were also examined in the tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At the beginning of the seventies, experimental research using short duration supersonic shock driven wind tunnel were conducted and showed the efficiency of Lorentz force action on supersonic (Mach 1.4) dense (1 bar) low magnetic Reynolds number hot (10000 K) argon flows. When working as a generator, the linear Faraday MHD converter was efficient enough, due to high electrical conductivity (3000 S/m) to create a front shock wave at the intake of the constant cross-section MHD converter. Accelerations up to 5000 m/s were obtained in 10 cm long channels. This suggested the possibility to achieve complete shock wave and turbulent wake cancellation, through MHD bypass concept. Such work gave publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentation in international MHD meetings (French Academy of Sciences 1970, Moscow 1983, Tsukuba 1986, Beijing 1992). The work was conducted both through computational simulations (based on the method of characteristics) and hydraulic simulation experiments. We present the synthesis of such studies through a project of a hypersonic vehicle based on an MHD bypass concept, landing under its own steam, using classical turbojets. Then, at Mach 3 and high altitude, MHD controlled inlets axe opened. A wall converter slows down the hypersonic incoming air flow, without excessive heating, feeding a ramjet system. The subsequent electric power provides an additional impulse to the flow in the exhaust section. Cruise Mach number: 12. Local Hall parameter regime produces high voltage that, sent to the leading edges, creates a plasma cushion which prevents too high thermal flux. Lift is provided by wave riding technique. Additional rocket propeller could transform it as a reusable space launcher.

AB Sound pressure level contours and spectral sound distributions around the Vega launch system are computed by means of a standard empirical model developed by NASA and a novel hybrid empirical/computational aeroacoustics approach. The empirical prediction is validated against available noise spectra measured on a scaled mock-up, showing a fairly good agreement. when standard values for the model constants are used. The jet sources employed in the empirical prediction are then used to convolute a database of tailored Green's functions computed by means of a frequency-domain computational aeroacoustics code. This second approach allows the consideration of the real launch pad geometry and, in the limit of the grid resolution drawn by the acoustic wavelength, the mean flow refraction effects in the jet stream. The mean flow is supplied by a FLUENT simulation and projected onto the computational aeroacoustics grid. This is a Cartesian grid generated automatically and used in connection with an immersed-boundary approach. It is shown that the hybrid empirical/computational aeroacoustics prediction is able to explain some discrepancies observed between the experimental data and the empirical predictions. In addition, it generates a basis of elementary fields to be used in a source localization method under development in the framework of the Innovative Aerothermodynamic Configurations for Space Transport Systems research project, funded by the Italian Space Agency.

AB The control of ignition in a rocket engine is a critical problem for combustion chamber design. Delayed ignition may lead to high-amplitude pressure fluctuations that can damage the burner (strong ignition), whereas early ignition may fail. This paper describes a numerical study of a strong ignition sequence observed in a laboratory-scale single-injector rocket chamber ignited by a laser and fueled with gaseous oxygen and hydrogen. OH-emission images, Schlieren pictures, and pressure measurements make it possible to follow the flame propagation experimentally. The present large eddy simulation (LES) approach includes shock treatment, a six species-seven reaction chemical scheme for H-2-O-2, and a model for the energy deposition by a laser. Flame/turbulence interaction is modeled with the thickened flame concept. LES is used to compute both the filling phase (during which the gaseous hydrogen and oxygen mix) and the ignition phase. The flame location and structure, as well as the temporal evolution of the chamber pressure obtained numerically, are in good agreement with the experiment. The use of complex chemistry in the computation also allows the comparison of LES data with experimental OH-images and shows that the sensitivity of the CCD camera used to record the spontaneous emission of the OH* radical is not high enough to property locate the flame front in rich regions. The combined experimental and numerical results lead to a more detailed analysis of the ignition processes and its coupling with flow rate oscillations in the H-2 and O-2 feeding lines.

DE Combustion; Acoustic coupling; High frequency instability; Injection
AB High frequency combustion instabilities have technical importance in the design of liquid rocket engines. These phenomena involve a strong coupling between transverse acoustic modes and combustion. They are currently being investigated by combining experimentation and numerical simulations. On the experimental level, the coupling is examined in a model scale system featuring a multiple injector combustor (MIC) comprising five coaxial injectors fed with liquid oxygen and gaseous methane. This system is equipped with a novel VHAM actuator (Very High Amplitude Modulator) which comprises two nozzles and a rotating toothed wheel blocking the nozzles in an alternate fashion. This device was designed to obtain the highest possible levels of transverse oscillation in the MIC. After a brief review of the VHAM, this article reports cold flow experiments using this modulator. Velocity maps obtained under resonant conditions using the VHAM are examined at different instants during a cycle of oscillation. Experimental data are compared with numerical pressure and velocity fields obtained from an acoustic solver. The good agreement observed in the nozzle vicinity indicates that numerical simulations can be used to analyze the complex flow field generated by the VHAM. To cite this article: Y. Mery et al., C.

TI Indoor air quality impacts of an improved wood stove in Ghana and an
   ethanol stove in Ethiopia
SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Improved cookstove; Indoor air pollution; Particulate matter; Carbon
   monoxide; Ethanol; Fuel wood
AB This study was undertaken to assess the potential of two types of improved cookstoves to reduce indoor air pollution in African homes. An ethanol stove, the CleanCook, was tested in three locations in Ethiopia: the city of Addis Ababa and the Bonga and Kebribeyah Refugee Camps, while a wood-burning rocket stove, the Gyapa, was evaluated in Accra, Ghana. In both countries, kitchen concentrations of PM2.5 and CO, the two pollutants responsible for the bulk of the ill-health associated with indoor smoke, were monitored in a before and after study design without controls. Baseline ('before') measurements were made in households using a traditional stove or open fire. 'After' measurements were performed in the same households, once the improved stove had been introduced. PM2.5 was measured using UCB Particle Monitors, which have photoelectric detectors. CO was measured with Onset HOBO Loggers. In Ghana and Kebribeyah Camp, CO was also measured with Gastec diffusion tubes. In Ghana, average 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations decreased 52% from 650 mu g/m(3) in the 'before' phase to 320 mu g/m(3) in the 'after' phase (p=0.00), and average 24-hour kitchen CO concentrations decreased 40% from 12.3 ppm to 7.4 ppm (p=0.01). Including all three subgroups in Ethiopia, average PM2.5 concentrations decreased 84% from 1 250 mu g/m(3) to 200 mu g/m(3) (p=0.00) and average CO concentrations decreased 76% from 38.9 ppm to 9.2 ppm (p=0.00). 24-hour average CO levels in households using both the Gyapa and CleanCook stoves met, or nearly met, the World Health Organization (WHO) 8-hour Air Quality Guideline. PM2.5 concentrations were well above both the WHO 24-hour Guideline and Interim Targets. Therefore, despite the significant improvements associated with both of these stoves, further changes in stove or fuel type or household fuel mixing patterns would be required to bring PM to levels that are not considered harmful to health.

DT Article
DE Magnetic levitation; superconducting magnet
AB Two superconducting magnets, mounted on a rocket sled are propelled by solid fuel rocket motors. During sled motion, the field from the magnets interacts with passive copper rails embedded in a concrete guideway to produce levitation and flight stability. Six flight tests have been successfully conducted to date with the most recent in April 2008 reaching 673 kilometer per hour. The magnets consist of racetrack coils, which are wet lay-up wound with rectangular NbTi wire. They were tested to 245 A with a peak field of 7.5 T and winding current density of 38 kA/cm(2). The coils are bath cooled. A passive valving system prevents loss of liquid during rapid acceleration and deceleration. Boil-off gas cools an aluminum thermal shield and the current leads. In this paper we present the most recent magnet design, static and flight test results.

AB This paper presents the results of the first DEIMOS Liquid Methane/Oxygen rocket engine test campaign. DEIMOS is an acronym for 'Delft Experimental Methane Oxygen propulsion System'. It is a project performed by students under the auspices of DARE (Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering). The engine provides a theoretical design thrust of 1800 N and specific impulse of 287 s at a chamber pressure of 40 bar with a total mass flow of 637 g/s. It has links to sustainable development, as the propellants used are one of the most promising so-called 'green propellants'-combinations, currently under scrutiny by the industry, and the engine is designed to be reusable. This paper reports results from the provisional tests, which had the aim of verifying the engine's ability to fire, and confirming some of the design assumptions to give confidence for further engine designs. Measurements before and after the tests are used to determine first estimates on feed pressures, propellant mass flows and achieved thrust. These results were rather disappointing from a performance point of view, with an average thrust of a mere 3.8% of the design thrust, but nonetheless were very helpful. The reliability of ignition and stability of combustion are discussed as well. An initial assessment as to the reusability, the flexibility and the adaptability of the engine was made. The data provides insight into (methane/oxygen) engine designs, leading to new ideas for a subsequent design. The ultimate goal of this project is to have all operational rocket and to attempt to set all amateur altitude record.

AB Over the last twenty years, the level of international research collaboration on military energetic materials has increased significantly and has been reported in the literature. It is time to look at what has been done and to critically examine that benefits that it has produced. The range of programmes has covered the whole range of energetic materials and in addition to the study of ne,x materials and new forms of materials, it has covered modelling as well as standards and protocols. Programmes have ranged from pressed explosives to rocket propellants and from IM technology to environmental and life management. It can be argued that these programmes have provided the participating nations with materials as well as the understanding to better manage their behaviour and use. Without this range of activity significantly less Would have been achieved. This will be discussed in the light of a selection of published papers and reports.

AB Numerical simulation of cavitation in cryogenic fluids is important in improving the stable operation of the propulsion system in liquid-fuel rocket. It also represents a broader class of problems where the fluid is operating close to its critical point and the thermal effects of cavitation are pronounced. The present article focuses on simulating cryogenic cavitation by implementing the "full cavitation model", coupled with energy equation, in conjunction with iterative update of the real fluid properties at local temperatures. Steady state computations are then conducted on hydrofoil and ogive in liquid nitrogen and hydrogen respectively, based on which we explore the mechanism of cavitation with thermal effects. Comprehensive comparisons between the simulation results and experimental data as well as previous computations by other researchers validate the full cavitation model in cryogenic fluids. The sensitivity of cavity length to cavitation number is also examined.

AB Explorative knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune function and regulation has provided optimism in developing cancer immunotherapy. However, three decades of experimental and clinical investigations to offer powerful immunotherapeutic strategies against solid tumors, with the possible exception of monoclonal antibody-targeted therapies, have not succeeded in significantly prolonging patient survival. Nonspecific immune approaches, including cytokine-based therapies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, have so far produced consistent, although limited, results. In this review, we present the developments of cell transfer-based strategies that, in preclinical studies, have demonstrated potential efficacy, but have only established tumor regression in limited numbers of patients. The key to success demands creative combinations of tumor antigens, adjuvance, gene modification and various administration strategies in the development of cell-based therapies together with other cancer-treatment principles, often in a stepwise 'space-rocket-type' approach. Combined efforts of several scientific disciplines, such as tumor biology and immunology, as well as cell and gene research in transplantation, will open new venues. New regulation for clinical trials with advanced therapy medicine products to ensure patient safety will be highlighted.

AB To study wall temperature distribution, film cooling effectiveness, and wall heat flux reduction due to film cooling in the circumferential direction, experimental investigations have been carried out, using gaseous hydrogen as a film coolant with tangential slot injection in close proximity to the injector face plate. A Vulcain-2-like test case has been performed, using a combustion chamber pressure up to 11.5 MPa at a high-mixture ratio of 6 with ambient temperatures of hydrogen. The experimental investigations have shown significant variations of wall temperatures due to injector design, as well as a distribution of film cooling effectiveness which persists far downstream from the film coolant injection slots. Circumferential variations of wall temperature and film cooling effectiveness are much more pronounced at higher combustion chamber pressures.

AB Cold-gas experiments are used to study the pressure oscillations occurring in solid rocket motors and the performance of different ways of passive control of these oscillations. Previous studies stated that flow-acoustic coupling is mainly observed for nozzles including a cavity. The nozzle geometry has an effect on the pressure oscillations through a coupling between the acoustic fluctuations induced by the cavity volume and the vortices traveling in front of the cavity entrance. An important reduction of pressure oscillations (I order of magnitude) is obtained, both for the axial and radial flow injection configurations, by removing the cavity located around the nozzle head. However, the nozzle integration cannot be avoided and this solution then cannot be implemented on a real flight. A permeable membrane (with holes to allow the combustion gas to pass through) placed in front of the cavity allows a reduction by a factor 1.5. The Helmholtz resonator shows a small attenuation of the pressure oscillations; however, its design could be optimized to maximize the acoustic damping. The three-dimensional-shaped inhibitors show a good attenuation of the pressure fluctuations, especially when the opening cross section is increased. This increase results in a shift of the Mach number associated with excitation. For a similar cross section, the asymmetric inhibitor (crenel-shaped) provides a reduction of pressure oscillations by a factor of 2 compared with an axisymmetric inhibitor. Therefore, the asymmetry of the inhibitor seems to be the best candidate for reducing the pressure oscillations.

AB A nozzle boundary-layer control system is under consideration for application in high-pressure rockets to mitigate the erosion rates of a graphite nozzle. The current design contains multiple center-perforated solid grains of fuel-rich materials consisting of succinic acid and polyvinyl acetate. This combination of the fuel-rich grains was selected due to high carbon and hydrogen contents along with relatively low evaporation temperature for generating fuel-rich gases. The characterization of the pyrolysis behavior or fuel-rich grains is a requirement for any subsequent quantitative analysis pertaining to the effect of the nozzle boundary-layer control system on graphite rocket nozzle erosion rates. Two separate experiments were conducted: 1) to determine the regression rate of solid fuel-rich grains under controlled heat flux or temperature conditions, and 2) to characterize its chemical decomposition and/or evaporation behavior. An empirical correlation between beat flux and surface regression rate of fuel-rich grains was developed. From Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, the fuel-rich grains were found to melt and evaporate at temperatures up to 773 K. These results have been used in parallel study nozzle throat erosion processes using computational simulation.

ID PROPELLANT; IGNITION; FLOW
AB To accurately predict the overall ignition transient for the reusable solid rocket motors of the space shuttle booster with head-end fin slots, it is necessary to have the knowledge of the flame-spreading rates in the fin-slot region. This paper is the second of a two part study and deals with the development of a flame-spreading correlation in the fin-slot region. A subscale (1:10) pie-shaped fin-slot motor was designed to perform diagnostic measurements for studying the flame-spreading behavior on the exposed propellant surface. Dynamic similarity was considered in the igniter design so the impinging jet had a similar exit angle onto the propellant surface in the fin-slot section. Flame-spreading measurements were gathered using a high-speed digital camera and nonintrusive optical measurement methods through an array of 36 near-infrared fast-response photodetectors; installed perpendicular to representative regions of the propellant surface. Results showed that the flame-spreading phenomena was highly nonuniform, starting in the downstream portion of the fin-slot region before traveling back toward the igniter. A correlation was developed for the dimensionless flame-spreading time interval showing that it was inversely proportional to the pressurization rate to a power of 0.62, which depends strongly upon the flow parameters of the igniter induced flow and local propellant grain geometry.

AB The ageing of double base rocket propellants (DB rocket propellants), which is a consequence of chemical reactions and physical processes that take place over time, has significant effect on their relevant properties (e. g. chemical composition, mechanical properties, ballistic properties, etc.). The changes of relevant properties limit the safe and reliable service life of DB rocket propellants. This is the reason why numerous research efforts are devoted to finding out reliable methods to measure the changes caused by ageing, to assess the quality at a given moment of time, and to predict remaining life-time of DB rocket propellants.
   In this work we studied dynamic mechanical properties of DB rocket propellant artificially aged at elevated temperatures, in order to detect and quantify changes in dynamic mechanical properties caused by the ageing. Dynamic mechanical properties were studied using dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA).
   The results obtained have shown that the ageing causes significant changes of DMA curve's shape and positions. These changes are quantified by following some characteristic points on DMA curves (e. g. glass transition temperatures; storage modulus, loss modulus and tan delta at characteristic temperatures, etc.). It has been found out that the most sensitive parameters to the ageing process are: storage modulus at viscoelastic and softening region, peak width and height on loss modulus curve, glass transition and softening temperature, and tan delta at viscoelastic region.

AB Effect of reduced gravity on heat transfer and rewetting temperature during quenching: application to rocket engines reignition. This paper describes the experimental strategy developed to improve the modeling of liquid-vapor flows during the chill down of rocket engines by cryogenic fluid in microgravity. A similarity analysis is performed to determine the relevant dimensionless numbers for the design of an experiment similar to engine flows. A literature review on reduced gravity quenching experiments, and on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer shows the lack of validated models for microgravity. Experimental results obtained with the quenching of a glass tube by FC72 during parabolic flight are presented. Especially the impact of gravity and subcooling on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer is investigated. Results show an increase in rewetting temperature, and a decrease in film boiling heat transfer tinder reduced gravity in agreement with the literature. The comparison of 0g flow pattern with corresponding tests on ground point out a behavior at 0g closer to 1g upflow than 1g downflow.

AB The reasons for studying single flexible body dynamics are that on one hand, it is the basis of flexible multi-body dynamics. If the theory of the single flexible body dynamics has been deeply studied, the theory of flexible multi-body dynamics will be researched easily. On the other hand, it has its unique and important applications. Quasi-variational principle of non-conservative single flexible body dynamics is established under the cross-link of particle rigid body mechanics and deformable body mechanics. Taking the interceptor as an example, this paper has explained the physical meaning of the quasi-stationary value condition of the quasi-variational principle in non-conservative single flexible body dynamics. Taking the launch of rocket as an example, it has illustrated the features of "one force for two effects" in a single flexible body dynamics. With an example of the extending flexible beam coupled with the spacecraft attitude, it has shown the transition from the single flexible body dynamics to the flexible multi-body dynamics. Finally, a number of related problems are discussed.

AB Computer experiments often are performed to allow modeling of a response surface of a physical experiment that can be too costly or difficult to run except by using a simulator. Running the experiment over a dense grid can be prohibitively expensive, yet running over a sparse design chosen in advance can result in insufficient information in parts of the space, particularly when the surface calls for a nonstationary model. We propose an approach that automatically explores the space while simultaneously fitting the response surface, using predictive uncertainty to guide subsequent experimental runs. We use the newly developed Bayesian treed Gaussian process as the surrogate model; a fully Bayesian approach allows explicit measures of uncertainty. We develop an adaptive sequential design framework to cope with an asynchronous, random, agent-based supercomputing environment by using a hybrid approach that melds optimal strategies from the statistics literature with flexible strategies from the active learning literature. The merits of this approach are borne out in several examples, including the motivating computational fluid dynamics simulation of a rocket booster.

AB An adhesive bonding structure around a metallic mouthpiece of a cryogenic composite tank was analyzed with fracture mechanics. The energy release rate was formulated analytically by considering difference in strain energies in tension and bending before and after crack growth based on a simplified mathematical model. The analytical results were compared by finite element method calculations for five example tanks; there was a fairly good match between the analytical and numerical results. This analysis provides a guideline for the initial optimal design of a cryogenic composite tank based on fracture mechanics.

ID DESIGN
AB The traditional payload attaching fitting (PAIF) does not provide any vibration isolation, because of its large stiffness. Whole-spacecraft vibration isolation is a direct and effective approach to assure the successful launching and orbit insertion of a spacecraft. In view of the problems of stiffness and vibration isolation design, for which the designers care most, the study of whole-spacecraft vibration isolator (WSVI) consists of two parts. In the first part, the stiffness feature of the WSVI is studied with reliability analysis and experimental data. In the second part, the problems induced by stiffness feature are discussed. The simulated and experimental data show that the transmissibility, which is coupled with stiffness, can be reduced by attaching the vibration isolator between the spacecraft and the launch vehicle.

AB A theoretical investigation of the coupling between the core How process and combustion sublayer process in a rocket chamber flow is presented. The focus of the investigation is on penetration of chamber disturbances into the sublayer and on the burn rate characteristic responses. Characteristic solutions to the local non-parallel instability problem supported by gasifying propellant in a double slab geometry are sought. In the fully decoupled limit the only characteristic solution response is a pressure response, thus comparisons between coupled and decoupled pressure responses are presented. The propellant is typified by a set of burning characteristics, and their effect on the coupling is explored. The goal of the analysis is to clarify the extent strand burning characteristics (i.e., in zero cross flow conditions) can affect burn rate perturbations leading to the phenomenon of erosive burning. The findings of this research agree with experimental Studies as it regards the effect of burning parameters on erosive behavior change in erosive sensitivity with propellant characteristics is thus correlated with a change in the core-sublayer interaction.

AB Composite materials are actively being used in the aerospace industry as a means of reducing weight. In particular, polymer matrix composites (PMC) are good candidates due to their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. A fundamental step to understand how a PMC will behave in a cryotank's extreme environmental is to first understand how the constituents (namely, the polymer matrix) behave in that same environment. Therefore, both stress-based and fracture-based experiments were conducted to evaluate four candidate polymers supplied by NASA Langley Research Center. Each type of test was conducted at approximately -196 degrees C (-320 degrees F), 24 degrees C (76 degrees F), and 160 degrees C (320 degrees F). Based on the results of the four polymer systems, a recommendation as to the best candidate for polymer matrix and adhesive bonding for Reusable Launch Vehicle's (RLV's) composite cryotanks is made.

The QSAT project began in 2006 as an initiative by graduate students of Kyushu University, and has the potential to contribute greatly to IHY (International Heliophysical Year) by showing to the world the beauty, importance, and relevance of space science. The primary objectives of the QSAT mission are (1) to investigate plasma physics in the Earth's aurora zone in order to better understand spacecraft charging, and (2) to conduct a comparison of the field-aligned current observed in orbit with ground-based observations. The QSAT project can provide education and research opportunities for students in an activity combining space sciences and satellite engineering. The QSAT satellite is designed to be launched in a piggyback fashion with the Japanese launch vehicle H-IIA. The spacecraft bus is being developed at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Kyushu University with collaboration of Fukuoka Institute of Technology. Regarding the payload instruments, the Space Environment Research Center of Kyushu University is developing the magnetometers, whereas the Laboratory of Spacecraft Environment Interaction Engineering of Kyushu Institute of Technology is developing the plasma probes. We aim to be ready for launch in 2009 or later.

LA English

DE Heat exchangers; precoolers; combined cycle engines; SABRE engine
AB Combined cycle engines employing both pre-cooled air-breathing and rocket modes of operation are the most promising propulsion system for achieving single stage to orbit vehicles. The air-breathing phase is purely for augmentation of the mission velocity required in the rocket phase and as such must be mass effective, re-using the components of the rocket cycle, whilst achieving adequate specific impulse. This paper explains how the unique demands placed on the air-breathing cycle results in the need for sophisticated thermodynamics and the use of a series of different heat exchangers to enable precooling and high pressure ratio compression of the air for delivery to the rocket combustion chambers. These major heat exchanger roles are; extracting heat from incoming air in the precooler, topping up cycle flow temperatures to maintain constant turbine operating conditions and extracting rejected heat from the power cycle via regenerator loops for thermal capacity matching. The design solutions of these heat exchangers are discussed.

   vibration isolation; vibrations
ID DESIGN
AB The problem of flexible structure vibration isolation on a flexible foundation is analytically investigated by simplifying the vibration isolation as single axis isolation, which can be realized by a proper design, and the problem of the whole spacecraft vibration is taken as an example for the application as both the spacecraft (isolated structure) and the launch vehicle (foundation) are flexible structures. A numerical example of the whole spacecraft vibration isolation is also provided for further explaining those conclusions derived from the analytical studies. It is found from the study that the isolator's damping is important for attenuating the vibration and that weakening the isolator's stiffness has the same effect as increasing its damping. However, a weaker stiffness means a weaker coupling among the structures and may magnify the vibration at some resonant frequencies, which are close to those of individual structures. The coupling effect of the structure's flexibility on the isolation may be significant in some cases and a coupling analysis is essential for ensuring the isolation performance. Because of the importance of the isolator's damping in reducing the vibration transmissibility and the vibration of the coupled structure, it is more appropriate to describe the vibration isolation of the flexible structure as vibration attenuation.

ID DEBRIS REMOVAL SYSTEM; SATELLITE; SURVIVABILITY; MODEL
AB By using electrodynamic drag to greatly increase the orbital decay rate, an electrodynamic space tether can remove spent or dysfunctional spacecraft from low Earth orbit (LEO) rapidly and safely, Moreover, the low mass requirements of such tether devices make them highly advantageous compared to conventional rocket-based de-orbit systems. However, a tether system is much more vulnerable to space debris impacts than a typical spacecraft and its design must be proved to be safe up to a certain confidence level before being adopted for potential applications. To assess space debris related concerns, in March 2001 a new task (Action Item 19.1) on the "Potential Benefits and Risks of Using Electrodynamic Tethers for End-of-life De-orbit of LEO Spacecraft" was defined by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). Two tests were proposed to compute the fatal impact rite of meteoroids and orbital debris on space tethers in circular orbits, at different altitudes and inclinations, as it function of the tether diameter to assess the survival probability of an electrodynamic tether system during typical de-orbiting missions. IADC members from three agencies, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), participated in the study and different computational approaches were specifically developed within the framework of the IADC task. This paper summarizes the content of the IADC AI 19.1 Final Report. In particular, it introduces the potential benefits and risks of using tethers in space, it describes the assumptions Made in the study plan, it compares and discusses the results obtained by ASI, JAXA and NASA for the two tests proposed, Some general conclusions and recommendations are finally extrapolated from this massive and intensive piece of research.

IADC members from three agencies, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), participated in the study and different computational approaches were specifically developed within the framework of the IADC task. This paper summarizes the content of the IADC AI 19.1 Final Report. In particular, it introduces the potential benefits and risks of using tethers in space, it describes the assumptions Made in the study plan, it compares and discusses the results obtained by ASI, JAXA and NASA for the two tests proposed, Some general conclusions and recommendations are finally extrapolated from this massive and intensive piece of research.

DE Launch vehicle control loop; Architectures; Unstable attitude angle
   feedback; Acceleration feedback
AB Most of architectures used for the control loop of launch vehicles are based on attitude angle, attitude rate and lateral acceleration feedbacks. Related controllers are usually chosen to be stable. The main purpose of this paper is to give a comparison between a few architectures, pointing out the benefits of an unstable attitude angle feedback design for the control of an aerodynamically unstable launch vehicle. Such a design indeed is appropriate to reduce significantly the aerodynamic load during atmospheric flight. This is an issue of practical interest as it has become a design driver for mechanical sizing of modern launchers.
   The paper recalls the various goals the control loop is trying to reach all along the atmospheric flight (stability, set point tracking, aerodynamic load minimization ...). For each phase of the flight, priorities are discussed. The paper then focuses on two critical phases of the atmospheric flight, i.e. high dynamic pressure period and atmospheric stages separation.

AB Interest in the domestic production of bioderived fuels, sparked by the high cost of petroleum crude oil, has led to consideration of fluids to replace or extend conventional petroleum-derived fuels. While ethanol as a gasoline extender has received a great deal of attention, this fluid has numerous problems, such as aggressive behavior toward engine components and a relatively low energy content. For these and other reasons, the butanols have been studied as gasoline extenders. For any extender to be designed or adopted, a suitable knowledge base of thermophysical properties is a critical requirement. In this paper, we provide volatility measurements of mixtures of a typical gasoline with n-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, and t-butanol, performed with the advanced distillation curve metrology. This recently introduced technique is an improvement of classical approaches, featuring (1) a composition-explicit data channel for each distillate fraction (for both qualitative and quantitative analyses), (2) temperature measurements that are true thermodynamic state points that can be modeled with an equation of state, (3) temperature, volume, and pressure measurements of low uncertainty suitable for equation of state development, (4) consistency with a century of historical data, (5) an assessment of the energy content of each distillate fraction, (6) trace chemical analysis of each distillate fraction, and (7) corrosivity assessment of each distillate fraction. We have applied the new method to fundamental work with hydrocarbon mixtures and azeotropic mixtures and also to real fuels. The fuels that we have measured include rocket propellants, gasolines, jet fuels, diesel fuels (including oxygenated diesel fuel and biodiesel fuels), and crude oils.

AB In the design of solid-propellant rocket motors, the ability to understand and predict the expected behaviour of a given motor under unsteady conditions is important. Research towards predicting, quantifying, and ultimately suppressing undesirable strong transient axial combustion instability symptoms necessitates a comprehensive numerical model for internal ballistic simulation under dynamic flow and combustion conditions. An updated numerical model incorporating recent developments in predicting negative and positive erosive burning, and transient, frequency-dependent combustion response, in conjunction with pressure-dependent and acceleration-dependent burning, is applied to the investigation of instability-related behaviour in a small cylindrical-grain motor. Pertinent key factors, like the initial pressure disturbance magnitude and the propellant's net surface heat release, are evaluated with respect to their influence on the production of instability symptoms. Two traditional suppression techniques, axial transitions in grain geometry and inert particle loading, are in turn evaluated with respect to suppressing these axial instability symptoms.

AB We present a new design of an in Situ detector for the study of meteor smoke particles (MSPs) in the middle atmosphere. This detector combines a classical Faraday cup with a xenon-flashlamp for the active photoionization/photodetachment of MSPs and the subsequent detection of corresponding photoelectrons. This instrument was successfully launched in September 2006 from the Andoya Rocket Range in Northern Norway. A comparison of photocurrents measured during this rocket flight and measurements performed in the laboratory proves that observed signatures are truly due to photoelectrons. In addition, the observed altitude cut-off at 60 km (i.e., no signals were observed below this altitude) is fully understood in terms of the mean free path of the photoelectrons in the ambient atmosphere. This interpretation is also proven by a corresponding laboratory experiment. Consideration of all conceivable species which can be ionized by the photons of the xenon-flashlamp demonstrates that only MSPs can quantitatively explain the measured currents below an altitude of 90 km. Above this altitude, measured photocurrents are most likely due to photoionization of nitric oxide. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the active photoionization and subsequent detection of photoelectrons provides a promising new tool for the study of MSPs; in the middle atmosphere. Importantly, this new technique does not rely on the a priori charge of the particles, neither is the accessible particle size range severely limited by aerodynamical effects. Based on the analysis described in this Study, the geophysical interpretation of our measurements is presented in the companion paper by Strelnikova, I., et al. [2008.

TI Flow instability due to cryogenic cavitation in the downstream of

SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Cryogenic fluid; Cavitation; Flow instability; Orifice
AB Flow instability in LRE (liquid rocket engine) occurs due to various reasons such as flow interactions with valve, orifice and venturi, etc. The inception of cavitation, especially in the propellant feeding system, is the primary cause of mass and pressure oscillations because of the cyclic formation and depletion of cavitation. Meanwhile, the main propellant in a liquid rocket engine is the cryogenic fluid, which properties are very sensitive to temperature variation. And the change of propellant properties to temperature variation by thermodynamic effect needs to be properly taken into account in the flow analysis in order to understand basic mechanisms for cryogenic cavitation. The present study focuses on the formation of cryogenic cavitation by using the IDM model suggested by Shyy and coworkers. The flow instability was also numerically investigated in the downstream of orifice with a developed numerical code. Calculation results show that cryogenic cavitation can be a primary source of flow instability, leading to mass fluctuations accompanied by pressure oscillations. The prediction of cavitation in cryogenic fluid is of vital importance in designing a feeding system of an LRE.

AB To accurately predict the overall ignition transient for the reusable solid rocket motor of the space shuttle booster with head-end fin slots, it is necessary to acquire detailed flowfield structure and energy transfer rates on the exposed inert fin-slot propellant surfaces. This paper is the first of a two-part study and deals with the Internal flowfield structure and heat-transfer characteristics In the fin-slot region, A subscale (1: 10) pie-shaped fin-slot motor was designed to perform diagnostic measurements. An array of 36 flush-mounted heat-flux gauges was installed to detect file local temperature-rise rates at representative regions perpendicular to the propellant surface. Flowfield visualizations were conducted by applying either a chalk-powder/kerosene mixture or many small threads taped to various locations on file inner surface or the sacrificial window or the fin-slot region for high-speed video camera recording. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for modeling the internal flowfield of the test rig. Results were used to develop it hod-transfer correlation governed by the internal flowfield structure within the fin-slot region. The theoretically calculated and experimentally observed internal flowfield patterns were similar in nature. The heat-transfer rates determined front the developed correlation matched the measured data trend within the experimental error. The flowfield structure and heat-transfer rate distribution are mainly governed by the major recirculating flow induced by the igniter jet.

DT Article
AB A trade study investigating the economics, mass budget, and concept. of operations for delivery of a small technology-demonstration satellite to a medium-altitude Earth orbit is presented. The mission requires payload deployment at a 19,000-km orbit altitude and tin inclination of 55 deg. Because the payload is a technology demonstrator and not part of an operational mission, launch and deployment costs are a paramount consideration. The payload includes classified, technologies; consequently a U.S.A. licensed launch system is mandated. A preliminary trade analysis is performed where all available options for Federal Aviation Administration licensed U.S. launch systems are considered. The preliminary trade study selects the Orbital Sciences Minotaur V launch vehicle, derived from the decommissioned Peacekeeper missile system, as the most favorable option for payload delivery. To meet mission objectives, the Minotaur V configuration is modified, replacing the baseline fifth stage ATK-37FM motor with the significantly smaller ATK Star 27. The proposed design change enables payload delivery to the required orbit without using a sixth stage kick motor. End-to-end mass budgets are calculated, and a concept of operations is presented. Monte Carlo simulations are used to characterize the expected accuracy of the final orbit. An optimal launch trajectory is presented.

AB A stabilizer that maintains a steady propellant mixture ratio in a liquid bipropellant rocket engine was introduced. First, a design criterion for the ideal performance of a general stabilizer was derived. A new stabilizer with bellows (bellows-type stabilizer) was proposed in the present study and relevant design parameters were identified by a mathematical model as well as a theoretical analysis. Governing equations were established to predict the static behaviour of the stabilizer. A bellows-type stabilizer was fabricated and its performance was measured. The performance predicted by the mathematical model showed satisfactory agreement with measurements and this validates the adequacy of the mathematical model proposed in the present study.

AB Multidisciplinary design optimization approaches have significant effects on aerospace vehicle design methodology. In designing next generation of space launch systems, MDO processes will face new and greater challenges. This study develops a system sensitivity analysis method to optimize multidisciplinary design of a two-stage small solid propellant launch vehicle. Suitable design variables, technological, and functional constraints are considered. Appropriate combinations of disciplines such as propulsion, weight, geometry, and trajectory simulation are used. A generalized sensitivity equation is developed and solved. These results are basis for optimization. Comparison of the developed approach with gradient optimization methods reveals that developed approach requires less computation time.

AB Chandrayaan-1, the first Indian planetary exploration mission, will carry out high resolution remote sensing studies of the moon to further our understanding about its origin and evolution. Hyper-spectral imaging in the UV-VIS-NIR region using three imaging spectrometers, along with a low energy X-ray spectrometer will provide mineralogical and chemical composition of the lunar surface at high spatial resolution. A terrain mapping camera will provide high resolution three-dimensional images of the lunar surface and will be complemented by a laser ranging instrument that will provide lunar altimetry. Three payloads - a high energy X-gamma ray spectrometer, a sub-keV atom reflecting analyser, and miniature imaging radar - will be used for the first time for remote sensing exploration of a planetary body. They will investigate transport of volatiles on the lunar surface, presence of localized lunar mini-magnetosphere and possible presence of water ice in the permanently shadowed lunar polar region respectively. A radiation dose monitor will provide information on energetic particle flux en route to the moon and in lunar orbit. An impact probe carrying an imaging system, a radar altimeter and a mass spectrometer will be released from the spacecraft to land at a predestinated lunar site. The design of the one tonne-class spacecraft is primarily adapted from flight proven Indian Remote Sensing satellite bus with several modifications that are specific to the lunar mission. The spacecraft was launched by using a variant of the indigenous Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-XL) and placed in a 100 km circular polar orbit around the moon with a planned mission life of two years. An Indian Deep Space Network and an Indian Space Science Data Center have been established as a part of Chandrayaan-1 mission and will cater to the need of future Indian space science and planetary missions.

AB We present a statistical analysis of the salient characteristics of current waveforms for 206 return strokes in 46 rocket-triggered lightning flashes. The flashes were triggered during a variety of experiments related to the interaction of lightning with power lines that were conducted from 1999 through 2004 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding, Florida. The return-stroke current, after measurement, was injected into either one of two test power lines or into the Earth near a power line via a grounding system of the rocket launcher. Statistical information is presented for return-stroke peak current, charge transfer, half-peak width, and 10%-90% risetime. Our return-stroke peak current statistics are found to be generally consistent with those reported from other triggered-lightning studies and appear to be independent of electrical properties of the strike object, as previously found in another study. We found significant correlation (R-2 = 0.76) between lightning return-stroke peak current and the corresponding charge transfer within 1 ms after return-stroke initiation. The dependence is surprisingly similar to that found by Berger and co-workers for the natural first return-stroke peak currents and 1-ms charge transfers. The means of the 10%-90% current risetimes for strikes to the power line ( geometric mean 1.2 mu s) and for strikes to the Earth ( geometric mean 0.4 mu s) are significantly different which indicates that the electrical properties of the strike object affect the risetime. This effect is likely related to the impedance seen by lightning at the strike point and/or to reflections at impedance discontinuities within the strike object, larger effective impedances apparently resulting in larger risetimes. A dependence of the return-stroke current half-peak width on the electrical properties of the strike object was not observed in our direct and nearby-strike experiments.

AB An optimum method for design of a liquid hydrogen regenerative cooling combustor for the LOX/hydrogen engine was constructed using the author's previous empirical correlation of C* efficiency and calculation model for combustion characteristics, and the present calculation model for the heat load characteristics for LOX/hydrogen combustion. Using this method, the atomization characteristics of the injected LOX jet, the combustion performance including combustion stability, and the heat load on the combustor were evaluated for LOX/hydrogen upper-stage engines such as the LE-5, RL-10 and HM-7. This method was then applied to the LE-5B engine, which is the derivative engine of the LE-5 and has been used as the second stage of the H-2A launcher, to improve combustion stability and to optimize configuration of the injector and combustor. A reduction of about 30% in chamber length of it with sufficient combustion performance was achieved by such optimization.

TI An analysis of the orbital distribution of solid rocket motor slag
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The contribution by solid rocket motors (SRMs) to the orbital debris environment is potentially significant and insufficiently studied. Design and combustion processes can lead to the emission of enough by-products to warrant assessment of their contribution to orbital debris. These particles are formed during SRM tail-off, or burn termination, by the rapid solidification of molten Al(2)O(3) slag accumulated during the burn. The propensity of SRMs to generate particles larger than 100 mu m raises concerns regarding the debris environment. Sizes as large as 1 cm have been witnessed in ground tests, and comparable sizes have been estimated via observations of sub-orbital tail-off events. Utilizing previous research we have developed more sophisticated size distributions and modeled the time evolution of resultant orbital populations using a historical database of SRM launches, propellant, and likely location and time of tail-off. This analysis indicates that SRM ejecta is a significant component of the debris environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We tested the in situ pollen transfers and allelopathic impacts of the putative pollen allelopathic spp. [Alliaria petiolata L. and Hesperis matronalis L. oil the sympatric Concurrently flowering spp. Alyssum alyssoides (L.), Cardamine diphylla (Michx.) Willd., Lepidium campestre (L.) R. Br. and Sisymbrium altissimum L]. Pearson product moment and Mann Whitney U tests indicated that regardless of whether Coulter Counters or microscope counts were used to count pollen, there was sufficient pollen transfer front the Alliaria petiolata and Hesperis matronalis to all spp. except Cardamine diphylla, where its pollinator is more fidelous. When there was a relatively low maximum of 10 pollen grains of either Alliaria petiolata or Hesperis matronalis oil stigmas of Alyssum alyssoides, Lepidium campestre and Sisymbrium altissimum, the pollen tube generation declined by 80% and the difference compared to stigmas with no heterospecific pollen was significant (Pearson product moment tests, P < 0.001). While this is typical for pollen allelopathic impacts, our conclusion is more cautious, because after 5-days in a sterilized environment, fungi that already existed on pollen and stigmas began to grow. This is unlike the situation in our research group's previous studies, where there was no "contamination" from fungi or any other organism or chemical. As Such, we conclude that while there is evidence of pollen allelopathic impacts, it is still possible that the declines in pollen tube generation in species receiving pollen from Alliaria petiolata or Hesperis matronalis may be due to immediate exudation from fungal spores carried on pollen or stigmas rather than pollen.

AB Exotic invasive plant species differ in their effects oil indigenous vegetation its evidenced by research evaluating community response to their removal. We used a removal approach to quantify file response of a mesic woodland to the removal versus retention of an invasive plant, Hesperis matronalis (dame's rocket) from paired treatment plots over 3 y. Cover of H. matronalis did not differ between control and treatment plots prior to removal, declined in the removal plots and remained significantly lower in cover compared to file control plots. Removal did not significantly affect species richness and species diversify (evenness, Shannon and Simpson) at the plot scale, but did result in increased Species richness overall in the removal plots in the last sampling year when compared to control plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis indicated a significant compositional change in the spring plant composition of plots over the 3 y, reflecting an increase in exotic woody species. Exotic Woolly plants, especially Rosa multiflora and Euonymus alatus, increased in cover in response to H matronalis removal. In the 3 y, neither native nor exotic forbs, nor native woody plains responded to the removal of H. matronalis in a statistically significant manner. The increasing cover of woody invasive plants in response to the removal of II. matronalis has important management implications for restoration of degraded communities.

TI Self-pulsation characteristics of a gas-liquid swirl coaxial injector
SO ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS
LA English
DT Article
ID ROCKET ENGINE; ATOMIZATION
AB Self-pulsation usually occurs in the gas-liquid swirl coaxial injector of a liquid rocket engine and it is accompanied by an intense scream. When self-pulsation occurs, pressure and flow rate oscillations are detected by the strong interactions between the liquid and gas phases. Because this oscillation can amplify combustion instabilities in liquid rocket, self-pulsation must be suppressed. Considerable research has been performed on self-pulsation characteristics, but the mechanism of self-pulsation has not been clarified. The main objective of this research is to understand the mechanism of self-pulsation. Toward this objective, the acoustic and spray characteristics of self-pulsation spray were investigated using the acoustic device and laser system; the dominant frequency of the liquid sheet was also measured. It was found that the frequencies of the scream and the spray oscillation are linearly proportional to the liquid and gas axial Reynolds number, and the self-pulsation frequency is determined by the unstable wave of the liquid sheet. Therefore it is concluded that self-pulsation occurs due to the dominant wave of the liquid sheet.

AB Compared with steam catapult system, electromagnetic launcher (EML) system is highly integrated, and it has high and well matching performance. It will be widely used aircraft carriers ejection, rocket launchers etc in future. Double-side tabular permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) for electromagnetic launcher can meet the requirements of big thrust and high efficiency etc. It can accelerate the launcher at the expected speed in short time. The thrust characteristic of the launcher is essential to the whole electromagnetic launcher system. Large thrust and small thrust ripple are both expected. This paper studies thrust characteristic of different pole arc coefficients, compares the series and parallel magnetic circuit structures, and analyses the method of staggering a certain distance between poles on both sides. In order to achieve the goal of large thrust, the Launcher is often designed with high current density. As a result, it is of great loss and has quick temperature rise. This paper establishes numerical model of the two-dimensional (2D) primary transient temperature field. The temperature field of the short-term system is analyzed. The calculated and experimental results of the electromagnetic launchers can provide a basis for optimum design.

AB A pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE) model with solenoid valves was designed whose diameter and length are 30mm and 850mm respectively. The model was performed with liquid C10H21 as fuel, compressed oxygen as oxidizer and nitrogen as purge gas, and was ignited by a spark with low energy. Multi-cycle detonation test showed the operation frequency Of the PDRE model can reach up to 35 Hz, which as we know is so far the maximum operation frequency of PDRE with solenoid valves and liquid fuel. The peak value of detonation wave pressure is more than 3.4 MPa and the time-averaged thrust Of PDRE is 43.9N while the operation frequency is 35Hz.

AB The paper describes the design and manufacturing of a gaseous propel I ant rocket engine. It is an undertaking of the authors, performed on project basis with fellow aerospace engineering Students under auspices of DARE (Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering). This paper describes the requirements, the engine development, and the design considerations and calculations as they were performed. Furthermore, the plans for engine tests and the parameters that will have to be measured during those tests are covered. The design process converged to a 1800 N thrust gaseous oxygen/methane (GOX/CH(4)) engine made of electrolytic copper. GOX/CH(4) was selected based oil its relatively high specific impulse, its availability and because of its potential as a green propellant. A test engine was produced with a specific impulse of 297 s and a propellant mass flow of 637 g/s. From a point of view of strength, the focus was mainly on robustness rather than light weight. The main aim now is to perform tests with the current engine, based oil which the performance can be verified and vital information for future design efforts can be acquired. The ultimate goal is to have an operational rocket and to attempt an amateur altitude record.

DT Article
AB The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission requirements presented many challenges to the observatories' mechanical design, analysis, and test program. STEREO's tight pointing stability requirements were complicated by low-frequency motion of multiple deployed appendages. Meeting launch vehicle requirements for payload stiffness and mass was difficult for the 3-m-tall, 2.1-m-wide observatory stack. The observatory stack also required precision spin balancing to fly on the Delta II third stage-a challenge with a weight limit of 1285 kg. This paper describes how the STEREO mission requirements were verified through analysis and testing. The verification methods used for STEREO spacecraft stability, strength, vibration, deployment, shock, acoustic, spin balance, and mass properties are discussed.

A physical model including a rocket motor, vacuum chamber, and diffuser, which have axisymmetric configurations was employed. Emphasis was placed on investigating the physical phenomena of very complex and oscillatory flow evolutions in the diffuser operating very close to the starting condition, i.e. at a minimum starting condition, which is one of the major important parameters from a diffuser design point of view.

DT Article
ID HYDROGEN ROCKET COMBUSTORS; SUPERCRITICAL CONDITIONS; LIQUID JET; SHEAR;
   PROPELLANTS; LAYERS
AB The global flow characteristics of the cryogenic flow injected from a single-element coaxial injector have been examined experimentally to simulate the flow and mixing behavior before ignition and combustion in characteristic rocket engines. The injector simulated one element of the cryogenic rocket engine injectors under realistic operating conditions. This work focuses specifically on the evolution of liquid nitrogen jet instability, spreading, and its atomization and mixing with the surrounding coaxial gaseous jet under steady-state atmospheric conditions. The effect of some important How parameters, such as velocity ratio and momentum ratio between jets, on the potential core length of the liquid nitrogen jet and shear angle of the flow have been analyzed. The results showed a significant role of these parameters on the instability and breakup of the liquid nitrogen jet, along with the strong heat transfer effect of the surrounding atmosphere on the cryogenic liquid nitrogen jet. The shear angle of the How remained constant along the longitudinal axis of the injector, thus confirming fully developed steady-state jet under atmospheric conditions. The mean value of the shear angle showed the transcritical nature of the liquid nitrogen jet under atmospheric conditions. The shear angle of the flow also reduced with introduction of the helium jet and decreased uniformly with increase in helium jet velocity, which supports the effect of surrounding gas density on the jet spreading as predicted by previous researchers. The potential core length of the cryogenic liquid nitrogen showed a local peak as a function of velocity of the gaseous jet and decreased exponentially with momentum ratio for values close to and higher than one.

AB A pulse detonation engine can be operated even if there are no compression mechanisms such as compressors or pistons, and a rocket engine with an extremely low combustor fill pressure (pulse detonation rocket) thus becomes possible. In this research, we made a model pulse-detonation-rocket system with increased specific impulse by partial fill. The performance predicted by this model was then confirmed experimentally. The thrust can be calculated by using the simplified pulse-detonation-engine model of Endo et al. [Endo, T., Kasahara, J., Matsuo, A., Inaba, K., Sato, S., and Fujiwara, T., "Pressure History at the Thrust Wall of a Simplified Pulse Detonation Engine," AIAA Journal, Vol. 42, No. 9, 2004, pp. 1921-1929] and the partial-filling-effect models of Sato et al. [Sato, S., Matsuo, A., Endo, T., and Kasahara, J., "Numerical Studies on Specific Impulse of Partially Filled Pulse Detonation Rocket Engines," Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2006, pp. 64-69]. The mass flow rate of the propellant supplied from the pressurized cylinders is considered in this calculation. As a result, the thrust performance can be determined by the kind of propellant, the initial conditions of the gas in the cylinders, the supply-valve-orifice and pulse-detonation-engine-tube volume, and the operation frequencies. We fabricated a pulse detonation rocket named Todoroki and verified the thrust calculation model via a horizontal sliding test. We confirmed that the stability of the pulse-detonation-engine operation depends on the ratio between the purge-gas thickness and the tube diameter. The thrust predicted by the model was identical to experimental results within 4%.

ID ELLIPTIC SHAPE TRANSITION
AB Scramjet engines promise significantly higher specific impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase if low-Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difficulty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system Includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 6-12 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled final-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled In deliver approximately 100 log to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5 % with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efficient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most significant improvement to their use for space access.

AB The use of computer programs driven by genetic algorithms has become an increasingly popular method for optimizing engineering designs. This paper focuses on the modeling and optimization of liquid-rocket-engine-propelled misslles with a computer program that is composed of a series of codes that simulate the performance of liquid-propelled rockets and are controlled by a genetic algorithm. Because the entire missile design is considered, the complete system performance must be modeled accurately and efficiently. The methodology described fit this paper fins been extended to both the preliminary design and reverse-engineering or liquid-propelled missiles. The performance model has been validated against the performance of a liquid- propelled missile and the results are provided. Two different fast-acrodynamic-prediction codes are used and their results are compared. A complete preliminary design or a liquid-propelled missile system is considered with a variety or goals and constraints. Results from the preliminary design optimization tire also shown and discussed in detail.

AB The military is pursuing a low-cost, responsive reusable launch vehicle that can rapidly place payloads in orbit in response to national defense requirements. The reusable launch vehicle is currently in the early stages of its design phase, when it is critical to assess design alternatives in terms of their operational capabilities as well as their life cycle support requirements. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory developed the space access vehicles mission and operations simulation (SAVMOS) model suite to assist in evaluating the mission cycle of the reusable launch vehicle. Part of the functionality of SAVMOS is the maintenance, integration, and launch pad operations simulation and test (MILEPOST) model. MILEPOST allows the user to evaluate candidate designs and perform tradeoff studies for the impact of design characteristics on regeneration time and support personnel requirements. We discuss MILEPOST development and present insights on process time and workforce sizing for several design alternatives.

AB The military is pursuing a low-cost, responsive reusable launch vehicle that can rapidly place payloads in orbit in response to national defense requirements. The reusable launch vehicle is currently in the early stages of its design phase, when it is critical to assess design alternatives in terms of their operational capabilities as well as their life cycle support requirements. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory developed the space access vehicles mission and operations simulation (SAVMOS) model suite to assist in evaluating the mission cycle of the reusable launch vehicle. Part of the functionality of SAVMOS is the maintenance, integration, and launch pad operations simulation and test (MILEPOST) model. MILEPOST allows the user to evaluate candidate designs and perform tradeoff studies for the impact of design characteristics on regeneration time and support personnel requirements. We discuss MILEPOST development and present insights on process time and workforce sizing for several design alternatives.

AB High-technology, direct, ditchless underground pipe laying is a challenge because there still are improved solutions to be applied to the specifically designed pneumatic rocket FORI 80. Analyzing the internal structure of the experimental model, you can notice the technical opportunities if replacing a certain rigid steel part by a flexible one. Replacing the rigid (steel)feeding rod by an elastic one (made of combined rubber and Teflon) is something original in the present-day Romanian technology of building pneumatic rocket improved models.

AB One of the main components of a carbonic material for rocket propulsors is coke [1, 2]. The coke characteristic should fulfill the requirements of application. Thus, the coke used as filler for rocket nozzle should meat some specific characteristic as powdering, soft packing for SiC and other ranforsants and a certain degree of graphitization at elevate temperature. Under these and other considerations there were performed researches on laboratory scale to obtain cokes using available cheap precursors. There were obtained six coke sorts using two coke precursor charge compositions and three different heat treatments. The clasical coke characteristics of the six new cokes were mesured For a better understanding of the coke characteristics there were performed advanced investigations by SEM, WAXD and ED(P)XRFS.
   The morphologie of coke lump or/and coke fines were revelead by SEM while the atomic coke structures were investigated by WAXD, The coke particle morphology and structure data are directly regarded to the coke packing efficiency and its mechanical strengts. The ED(P)XRF is used to check the residual impurities in coke that may have a significant environmental risk as Pb, Cd, Zn, As etc. The same, the impurities could react with matrix at elevate temperatures causing unpredicted effects. The paper emphasises the existence of a specific correlation between coke morphology and coke atomic structure which should be established for each sort if one wants to achieve optimum coke perforances for a specifific application.
   By the authors knowledge, the paper is among the few in this field that use clasical means toghether with modern WAXD and ED(P)XRFS techniques for advaced characterisanon of coke.

AB Ballistic imaging is the name applied to a category of optical techniques that were originally developed for medical applications. Recently, ballistic imaging was adapted to acquire instantaneous images of the liquid core inside atomizing sprays; a region that has been heretofore inaccessible to spray researchers. An important difference between spray research and the medical imaging problem is the need for high fidelity single-shot (within 10 mu s) imaging in a spray whereas stationary tissue images can be averaged. Transient ballistic imaging diagnostics have been used to reveal details of the primary breakup process in it LOX injector. a turbulent water jet, a water jet in cross-flow, a transient diesel fuel spray, a rocket fuel injector, and an aerated spray. This paper briefly discusses various methods for imaging the liquid core, it introduces ballistic imaging and provides specific examples, it describes detailed studies of photon transmission through dense media, and it then discusses incorporation of those results into a model for a ballistic imaging instrument that can evaluate and optimize various concepts.

TI Material considerations in the STEREO solar array design

LA English
DT Article
AB Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), the third mission in NASA's Solar Terrestrial Probes program, launched aboard a single Delta 11 7925 launch vehicle on October 25, 2006 from Cape Canaveral. This two-year mission employs two nearly-identical, space-based observatories, one ahead of the Earth in its orbit, and the other trailing behind, to provide the first stereoscopic measurements of the sun and its coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. The STEREO observatories utilize four sets of solar arrays, each of which experienced a two-stage deployment on-orbit. This paper illustrates material considerations in the solar array subsystem design. It first focuses on the solar array substrate, considering material coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) concerns when choosing a substrate laminate to which the solar cells will adhere. It then explores a similar issue when choosing a substrate insert material. Next, the focus shifts to material considerations in the solar array hinge design. This design was driven not just by function, but by a host of different material considerations, ranging from mass savings to fabrication time and cost. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Solid propellant; Rocket motor; Finocyl grain; Static firing
AB The performance prediction of solid rocket motors is an important phase during the design process and it can be achieved easily if the burnback steps of the solid propellant are known. A method was developed by the authors to analyze and determine the grain burnback of solid propellants in rocket motors. To verify the predictions from the model, subscale ballistic rocket motor tests were performed in this study. An existing rocket motor was modified in terms of insulation, ignition delay, and sealing. Composite propellants containing Aluminum/HTPB/AP were cast into 3-D finocyl grains. Five different finocyl geometries were selected for static firings to obtain different boost and Sustain thrust profiles. For all the grains to be tested. finite element stress analyzes were conducted before they were manufactured and fired. Also, X-ray photography of each propellant grain was taken before the test to make sure that the grains were free of cracks and air bubbles. Recorded pressure-time traces from the tests showed that, depending on the requirements of the mission, different boost and sustain profiles Could be achieved by changing the geometrical parameters of the finocyl grain. This study Supplied a significant knowledge on static firings of rocket motors with complex 3-D grain geometries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Determination of the grain geometry is an important step in the design of solid propellant rocket motors. The performance prediction of the solid rocket motor can be achieved easily if the burnback steps of the grain are known. fit this study, grain burnback analysis for 3-D grain geometries wits investigated. The method used was solid modeling of the propellant grain for predefined intervals of burnback. In this method, the initial grain geometry was modeled parametrically using CAD software. For every burn step, the parameters were adapted and the new gram geometry was modeled. By analyzing these geometries, burn area change of the grain geometry was obtained. Using this data and internal ballistic parameters, the performance of the solid propellant rocket motor in terms of motor pressure was achieved. The comparison between the results from this study and the results front the actual rocket motor tests shows that the procedure that was developed can be Successfully used for the preliminary design of a solid propellant rocket motor.

AB This article presents a method to design and optimize 3D FINOCYL grain (FCG) configuration for solid rocket motors (SRMs). The design process of FCG configuration involves mathematical modeling of the geometry and parametric evaluation of various independent geometric variables that define the complex configuration. Virtually infinite combinations of these variables will satisfy the requirements of mass of propellant, thrust, and burning time in addition to satisfying basic needs for volumetric loading fraction and web fraction. In order to ensure the acquisition of the best possible design to be acquired, a sound approach of design and optimization is essentially demanded. To meet this need, a method is introduced to acquire the finest possible performance. A series of computations are carried out to formulate the grain geometry in terms of various combinations of key shapes inclusive of ellipsoid, cone, cylinder, sphere, torus, and inclined plane. A hybrid optimization (HO) technique is established by associating genetic algorithm (GA) for global solution convergence with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for further local convergence of the solution, thus achieving the final optimal design. A comparison of the optimal design results derived from SQP, GA, and HO algorithms is presented. By using HO technique, the parameter of propellant mass is optimized to the minimum value with the required level of thrust staying within the constrained burning time, nozzle and propellant parameters, and a fixed length and outer diameter of grain.

AB THEMIS, NASA's fifth Medium Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission will monitor the onset and macro-scale evolution of magnetospheric substorms. It is a fleet of 5 small satellites (probes) measuring in situ the magnetospheric particles and fields while a network of 20 ground based observatories (GBOs) monitor auroral brightening over Northern America. Three inner probes (similar to 1 day period, 10 R(E) apogee) monitor current disruption and two outer probes (similar to 2 day and similar to 4 day period, 20 R(E) and 30 R(E) apogees respectively) monitor lobe flux dissipation. In order to time and localize substorm onsets, THEMIS utilizes Sun-Earth aligned conjunctions between the probes when the ground-based observatories are on the nightside. To maintain high recurrence of conjunctions the outer orbits have to be actively adjusted during each observation season. Orbit maintenance is required to rearrange the inner probes for dayside observations and also inject the probes into their science orbits after near-simultaneous release from a common launch vehicle.
   We present an overview of the orbit strategy, which is primarily driven by the scientific goals of the mission but also represents a compromise between the probe thermal constraints and fuel capabilities. We outline the process of orbit design, describe the mission profile and explain how mission requirements are targeted and evaluated. Mission-specific tools, based on high-fidelity orbit prediction and common magnetospheric models, are also presented. The planning results have been verified by in-flight data from launch through the end of the first primary science seasons and have been used for mission adjustments subject to the early scientific results from the coast phase and first tail season.

DE THEMIS; Microsatellite; Probe; Constellation
AB The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is the fifth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. The mission employs five identical micro-probes (termed "probes"), which have orbit periods of one, two and four days. Each of the Probes carries five instruments to measure electric and magnetic fields as well as ions and electrons. Each probe weighs 134 kg including 49 kg of hydrazine fuel and measures approximately 0.8x0.8x1.0 meters (LxWxH) and operates on an average power budget of 40 watts. For launch, the Probes were integrated to a Probe Carrier and separated via a launch vehicle provided pyrotechnic signal. Attitude data are obtained from a sun sensor, inertial reference unit and the instrument Fluxgate Magnetometer. Orbit and attitude control use a RCS system having two radial and two axial thrusters for roll and thrust maneuvers. Its two fuel tanks and pressurant system yield 960 meters/sec of delta-V, sufficient to allow Probe replacement strategies. Command and telemetry communications use an S-band 5 watt transponder through a cylindrical omni antenna with a toroidal gain pattern. This paper provides the key requirements of the probe, an overview of the probe design and how they were integrated and tested. It includes considerations and lessons learned from the experience of building NASA's largest constellation.

AB The High Altitude Student Platform (HASP) was originally conceived to provide student groups with access to the near-space environment for flight durations and experiment capabilities intermediate between what is possible with small sounding balloons and low Earth orbit rocket launches. HASP is designed to carry up to twelve student payloads to an altitude of about 36 km with flight durations of 15-20 h using a small zero-pressure polyethylene film balloon. This provides a flight capability that can be used to flight-test compact satellites, prototypes and other small payloads designed and built by students. HASP includes a standard mechanical, power and communication interface for the student payload to simplify integration and allows the payloads to be fully exercised. Over the last two years a partnership between the NASA Balloon Program Office (BPO), Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF), Louisiana State University (LSU), the Louisiana Board of Regents (BoR), and the Louisiana Space Consortium (LaSPACE) has led to the development, construction and, finally, the first flight of HASP with a complement of eight student payloads on September 4, 2006. Here we discuss the primary as-built HASP systems and features, the student payload interface. HASP performance during the first flight and plans for continuing HASP flights. The HASP project maintains a website at http://laspace.lsu.edu/hasp/ where flight application, interface documentation and status information can be obtained. (C) 2007 COSPAR.

AB This paper provides the formulation used for studing the cold and hot separating stages of a multistage launch vehicle. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to account for the off nominal design parameters of the bodies undergoing separation to evaluate the risk of failure for the separation event. All disturbances, effect of dynamic unbalance, residual thrust, separation disturbance caused by the separation mechanism and misalignment in cold and hot separation are analyzed to find out nonoccurrence of collision between the separation bodies. The results indicate that the current design satisfies the separation requirements.

ID MISSION
AB The FORMOSAT-3 mission, also known as Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), is the third major project of the Formosa Satellite (FORMOSAT) series implemented by the National Space Organization of Taiwan. FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC is a joint Taiwan/U.S. mission consisting of six identical low Earth orbit satellites. All six cluster satellites were successfully launched by a single Minotaur launch vehicle on April 15, 2006. The retrieved global positioning system (GPS) radio occultation (RO) data have been freely available online to the science community since shortly after the completion of satellite bus in-orbit checkout. Having completed the verification and validation, the worldwide science communities are highly satisfied with the RO data. Scientists have hailed the RO sensors as offering the most accurate, precise, and stable thermometers in space. After one year in orbit, all six FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites were in good condition (except FM2, which had power shortage issues) and were on their way toward the final constellation of six separate orbit planes with 30 degrees separation. Four out of six satellites had already reached their final mission orbit of 800 kin by mid-May 2007. Together, the six satellites have generated a total of more than 2500 RO data per day. However, only 50%-70% of the RO data as received one year after launch could be retrieved into useful atmosphere profiles. The retrieved RO data, about 1800 per day on average, have been assimilated into numerical weather prediction models by many major weather forecast centers and research institutes. This paper provides an overview of the constellation mission, the spacecraft system performance after one year in orbit, the technical challenges we have encountered, and the performance enhancements we have accomplished.

AB The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conducted the Total Diet Study (TDS) since 1961, which designed to monitor the US food supply for chemical contaminants, nutritional elements, and toxic elements. Recently, perchlorate was analyzed in TDS samples. Perchlorate is used as an oxidizing agent in rocket propellant, is found in other items (e. g., explosives, road flares, fireworks, and car airbags), occurs naturally in some fertilizers, and may be generated under certain climatic conditions. It has been detected in surface and groundwater and in food. Perchlorate at high (e.g., pharmacological) doses can interfere with iodide uptake into the thyroid gland, disrupting its function. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has identified that "the fetuses of pregnant women who might have hypothyroidism or iodide deficiency as the most sensitive population." This study reports on intake estimates of perchlorate and iodine, a precursor to iodide, using the analytical results from the TDS. Estimated average perchlorate and iodine daily intakes as well as the contribution of specific food groups to total intakes were estimated for 14 age/sex subgroups of the US population. The estimated smallest lower bound to the largest upper bound average perchlorate intakes by the 14 age/sex groups range from 0.08 to 0.39 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day (mu g/kgbw/day), compared with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference dose (RfD) of 0.7 mu g/kgbw/day. Infants and children demonstrated the highest estimated intakes of perchlorate on a body weight basis. The estimated average iodine intakes by the 14 age/sex groups reveal a lower bound (ND=0) and upper bound (ND=LOD) range of average intakes from 138 to 353 mu g/person/day. Estimated iodine intakes by infants 6-11 months exceed their adequate intake (AI), and intakes by children and adult age/sex groups exceed their relevant estimated average requirement (EAR).

ID TRANSIENT COMBUSTION; INTERNAL BALLISTICS
AB Various factors and trends related to the presence of inert particles in the central core flow as a means to suppress axial-combustion-instability symptom development are numerically predicted for a composite-propellant cylindrical-grain motor. Individual transient internal-ballistic-simulation runs show the evolution of the axial pre sure wave and associated base pressure shift for a given inert particle size and loading percentage, as initiated by a given pressure disturbance. The pressure wave's limit magnitude at a later reference time in a given firing simulation run is collected for a series of runs at different particle sizes and loadings and is mapped onto an attenuation trend chart in a format potentially useful for motor designers evaluating their specific motor design and particle loading requirements (and, in turn, allowing for less experimental test firings, if the numerical results are relatively accurate). When the effect of acceleration (through structural vibration of the propellant surface) on the combustion process is included in the numerical calculations, one observes substantial differences in burning and internal How behavior in the presence of axial-pressure-wave activity, as reflected in individual firing simulations and the corresponding particle attenuation map. The predicted base pressure shift is more pronounced at lower particle loadings: for example, in conjunction with the pressure-wave magnitude being larger, when the propellant's burning process is substantially sensitive to normal acceleration. Whether the propellant's burning rate is acceleration-sensitive or not, the inert particles' presence in the central core flow is demonstrated to be an effective means of suppression, correlating with past experimental successes in the usage of particles. Particle/burning-surface interactions, which may also act to suppress pressure-wave development by changing the propellant's inherent frequency-dependent combustion response, are not explicitly accounted for in this study, although one or two of the combustion-response model's pertinent coefficients could be altered to reflect this change, given sufficient information in this regard.

TI Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbit Communication Satellite Deliveries with
   Integrated Electric Propulsion
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID MISSIONS
AB The use of electric propulsion was evaluated for transfer of communication satellites from geosynchronous transfer orbits to geosynchronous earth orbits. Recent communication satellite designs, normal launch vehicle delivery orbits, and integrated electric propulsion subsystems (with input powers less than nominal satellite power levels) were assumed to minimize required changes to present and near-term launchers and spacecraft. The capture fraction of recent communication satellites that could have been delivered was evaluated versus launcher delivery capability, launch site, and in-space propulsion characteristics. Electric propulsion significantly increases the capture fraction of launchers with geosynchronous transfer mass delivery capabilities less than (dependent on launch site) about 4500 to 5500 kg. Insertion times at given launch sites were found to be accurately specified by the satellite power-to-mass ratios and the assumed electric propulsion specific-impulse/efficiency characteristics. Insertion times less than 100 days were found for satellites with high power-to-mass ratios that used high thrust-to-power electric propulsion options. The influence of power for electric propulsion beyond that used for satellite payloads and housekeeping was also assessed, and insertion times less than a month will require powers significantly higher than presently installed.

AB In this article, an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is presented for the motion of an incompressible viscous fluid in a channel with arbitrary pressure distribution. A generalization is pursued by expressing the pressure signal in terms of Fourier coefficients. The flow is characterized by two principal parameters: the pulsation parameter based on the periodic pressure gradient, and the kinetic Reynolds number based on the pulsation frequency. By way of verification, it is shown that for large kinetic Reynolds numbers, the Poiseuille flow may be recovered. Conversely, the purely oscillatory solution by Rott is regained for large pulsation parameters. For sinusoidal pulsations, the How rate is determined and compared with the steady flow analog obtained under the same pressure gradient. The amount of flow amplification or attenuation is determined as a function of frequency and pulsation parameters. For large frequencies, the maximum flow rate is evaluated and related to the pulsation parameter. By characterizing the velocity, vorticity, and shear stress distributions, cases of flow reversal are identified. Conditions leading to flow reversal are delineated for small and large kinetic Reynolds numbers in both planar and axisymmetric chambers. For an appreciable pulsation rate, we find that the flow reverses when the pulsation parameter is increased to the point of exceeding the Stokes number. By evaluating the skin friction coefficient and its limiting value, design criteria for minimizing viscous losses are realized. The optimal frequency that maximizes the flow rate during pulsing is also determined. Finally, to elucidate the effect of curvature, comparisons between planar and axisymmetric flow results are undertaken. The family of exact solutions presented here can thus be useful in verifying and validating computational models of complex unsteady motions in both propulsive and nonpropulsive applications. They can also be used to guide the design of fuel injectors and controlled experiments aimed at investigating the transitional behavior of periodic flows.

ID NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS; LINE RELAXATION; VISCOSITY
AB As part of a two-phase experimental study to obtain detailed heating and pressure data over the full-scale hypersonic international flight research and experimentation (HIFiRE-1, formally FRESH FX-1) flight geometry, Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center has completed a matrix of ground tests to determine the optimal flight geometry and instrumentation configuration necessary to make measurements of desired flow phenomena during the flight experiment. The primary objective of the HIFiRE-1 flight experiment is to collect high-quality flight data from integrated flight instrumentation to be used for computational fluid dynamic code and ground test facility validation in regions of boundary-layer transition, turbulent separated flow, and shock/boundary-layer interaction. To support this flight experiment, data have been obtained in the large energy national shock hypervelocity wind tunnel employing a full-scale model over a range of Mach numbers from 6.5 to 7.4 and Reynolds numbers from 0.5E + 06 to 5.5E + 6 duplicating the reentry trajectory. These points gave researchers the best chance to measure the transition process on the forecone and have a turbulent separated flow on the cylinder that reattached onto the flare section. These test condition ranges were determined directly from the nominal descent trajectory of the Australian-launched Terrier-Orion launch vehicle that will serve as the booster for HIFiRE-1. The entire experimental database will be compared to future flight data and used by computationalists to validate codes in regions of attached and separated laminar and turbulent flows with shock/boundary layer interaction. In addition to the experimental data, Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center performed a large amount of computational fluid dynamic analyses to confirm and validate not only the tunnel How conditions, but also the two- and three-dimensional flows over the model itself. These detailed computational results will be presented in a Part 2 companion paper.

AB This paper presents the development of a noise mitigation device for launch vehicle fairings and the performance of the device as measured from sounding rocket experiments conducted by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate. A new modeling approach to predict the internal acoustic response particular to sounding rockets is presented wherein the interior noise results from the time varying accelerations acting through the forward bulkhead. This model is different from typical approaches used for payload fairing noise prediction in which the primary noise sources are the rocket motors. This model would also apply to rockets of a similar aspect ratio and acceleration profile. The active acoustic absorber presented in this work can be tuned for optimal performance just minutes before launch. Acceleration and acoustic measurements from two sounding rocket launches are presented to validate the modeling approach and to demonstrate the performance of the active acoustic absorber. Data showed that a single device achieved an 8.8 dB reduction in the sound pressure level from 20 to 300 Hz.

AB The plume temperature of a solid propellant rocket engine (SPRE) is a fundamental parameter in denoting combustion Status. It is necessary to measure the temperature along both the axis and the radius of the engine. In order to measure the plume temperature distribution of a solid propellant rocket engine, the multi-spectral thermometry has been approved. Previously the pyrometer was developed in the Harbin Institute of Technology of China in 1999 which completed the measurement of SPRE plume temperature and its distribution with multi-spectral technique in aerospace model development for the first time. Following this experience, a new type of multi-target. multi-spectral high-speed pyrometer used in the ground experiments of SPRE plume temperature measurement was developed. The main features of the instrument include the use of a dispersing prism and a photo-diode array to cover the entire spectral band of 0.4 to 1.1 mu m. The optic fibers are used in order to collect and transmit the thermal radiation fluxes. The instrument can measure simultaneously the temperature and emissivity of eight spectra for six uniformly distributed points on the target surface, which are well defined by the hole on the field stop tens. A specially designed S/H (Sample/Hold) circuit, with 48 sample and hold units that were triggered with a signal, measures the multi-spectral and multitarget outputs. It can sample 48 signals with a less than 10ns time difference which is most important for the temperature calculation.

AB Carbonization is the first step in the heat and pressure treatment (pyrolysis) of composites in preparing carbon-carbon parts. These find many uses, including aircraft brakes, rocket nozzles and medical implants. This paper describes the acoustic emissions (AE) from various stages of the manufacturing process of carbon-carbon composites. This process involves carbonization at a high temperature and this results in both thermal expansion and volume change (due to pyrolysis in which a sacrificial polymer matrix is converted to carbon). Importantly the resultant matrix is porous and has a network of small intra-lamina cracks. The formation of these microcracks produces AE and this paper describes how this observation can be used to monitor (and eventually control) the manufacturing process. The aim is to speed up manufacture, which is currently time-consuming. The first section of the paper describes the design of unimodal waveguides to enable the AE to propagate to a cool environment where a transducer can be located. The second part of the paper describes various experimental observations of AE under a range of process conditions. In particular, this paper presents a technique based on detecting acoustic emissions and (1) uses wire waveguides to monitor parts within the autoclave to 800 degrees C, (2) monitors microcracking during pyrolysis, (3) uses a four-level threshold to distinguish between low- and high-amplitude cracking events, (4) recognizes the occurrence of harmful delaminations, and (5) guides the control of the heating rate for optimum efficiency of the pyrolysis process. In addition, supporting data are presented of in situ measurements of porosity, weight loss, cross-ply shrinkage, and mass spectroscopy of gases emitted. The process evolution is illustrated by the use of interrupted manufacturing cycle micrographs obtained by optical, scanning acoustic (SAM) and scanning electron (SEM) microscopy. The technique promotes in-process monitoring and control but also contributes to current understanding of pyrolysis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We recently introduced several important improvements in the measurement of distillation curves of complex fluids. The modifications to the classical measurement provide for (1) a composition-explicit data channel for each distillate fraction (for both qualitative and quantitative analysis), (2) temperature measurements that are true thermodynamic state points that can be modeled with an equation of state, (3) temperature, volume, and pressure measurements of low uncertainty suitable for equation of state development, (4) consistency with a century of historical data, (5) an assessment of the energy content of each distillate fraction, (6) trace chemical analysis of each distillate fraction, and (7) corrosivity assessment of each distillate fraction. We have applied the new method to the measurement of rocket propellant, gasolines, jet fuels, and hydrocarbon crude oils. In this paper we present the application of the technique to representative diesel fuel and mixtures of diesel fuel with some of the more promising oxygenating agents; namely, the glycol ethers and glycol esters: tri(propylene glycol) methyl ether (TPM), dibutyl maleate (DBM), and an 80/20 (vol/vol) mixture, of diethylene glycol methyl ether (DGME) + 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) a mixture often referred to as Cetaner. We present not only the distillation curves but also a chemical characterization of each fraction, and discuss the contrasts between the various mixtures. The measurements are significant as an environmental design tool for decreased particulate emissions.

TI TRACTIVE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ON RADIALLY DEPLOYABLE WHEEL CONFIGURATION
   OF LUNAR ROVER VEHICLE BY DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Radially deployable wheel; Discrete element method; Tractive
   performance; Trafficability; Lunar regolith
AB With the consideration of volume constraint of launch vehicle and trafficability of rover vehicle on lunar regolith terrain, a new design of radially deployable wheel is presented. For the purpose of achieving the meso-mechanics and dynamical behavior of lunar soil particles as well as macro-parameters of tractive performance for radially deployable wheel, the interaction between two types of wheel configurations and lunar soil particles is analyzed by means of discrete element method. The network of contact forces, the displacement vector chart, and the deformation of lunar soil beneath wheels are plotted. The equations of soil thrust, motion resistance, drawbar pull and driven torque are derived in granular scale based on the coordinates transformation and algebraic summation. The calculated results show that there is sufficient traction for both 6-split and 12-split radially deployable wheels with 304 mm outspread diameter to negotiate lunar regolith terrain specified here; the value of drawbar pull enhances with the increase of split number of radially deployable wheel, however, the required driven torque increases simultaneously, therefore, the tractive efficiency decreases.

AB The paper aims at presenting a Web-based product structure manager that enables designers to hold virtual meetings via Internet and that allows collaborative viewing, modification of product structure and annotation of the 3D model. This Web-based product structure manager provides a shared platform for the designers. Two concerns of designers of large systems are addressed in this application. First, heterogeneous application systems are used by designers and second, designers are geographically dispersed. In this context, STEP standard was found superior for data exchange among diverse CAD systems and the product structure manager has been developed as a "Web-based" application to achieve collaboration among designers. A case study has been carried out with this developed architecture for assembly modeling of a launch vehicle system called launcher hold and release system and its outcome is discussed in detail in this paper.

AB Helicon sources have been proposed by at least two groups for generating ions for space propulsion: the Helicon Double Layer Thruster (HDLT) concept at the Australian National University and the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetohydrodynamic Rocket (VASIMR) concept at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These sources normally require a large electromagnet and power supply to produce the magnetic field. At this stage of research, emphasis has been on the plasma density and ion current that can be produced, but not much on the weight, size, impulse, and gas efficiency of the thruster. This paper concerns the source itself and shows that great savings in size and weight can be obtained by using specially designed permanent magnets (PMs). This PM helicon design, originally developed for plasma processing of large substrates, is extended here for ion thrusters of both the HDLT and VASIMR types. Measured downstream densities are on the order of 10(12) cm(-3), which should yield much higher ion currents than reported so far. The design principles have been checked experimentally, showing that the predictions of the theory and computations are reliable. The details of two new designs are given here to serve as examples to stimulate further research on the use of such sources as thrusters.

DE grounding; lightning protective system (LPS); triggered lightning
AB We present the results of structural lightning protective system (LPS) tests conducted in 2004 and 2005 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, FL. Lightning was triggered using the rocket-and-wire technique, and its current was directly injected into the LPS The test configurations in 2004 and 2005 differed in the lightning current injection point, number of down conductors, grounding system at the test house, and the use of surge protective devices. The primary objective was to examine the division of the injected lightning current between the grounding system of the test house, and remote ground accessible via the neutral of the power-supply cable. In 2004, the mean value of the peak current entering the electrical circuit neutral in search of its way to remote ground was about 22% of the injected lightning current peak, while in 2005, it was about 59%. For comparison, more than 80% of the injected peak current was observed to enter the electrical circuit neutral in similar 1997 tests at the ICLRT in which a different test house with a different (poorer) grounding system was used (Rakov et al. 2002 [1]). An attempt to model the 2004 and 2005 experiments is presented in a companion paper.

TI A generic environment for modelling future launch operations - GEM-FLO:
   a success story in generic modelling

DE generic modelling; reusable models; launch vehicle design; shuttle
   simulation
AB Several NASA programs have been established to study and improve the current launch capability to meet the need for more aggressive space exploration in the future. Numerous launch systems have been proposed by different government and commercial organizations with the potential goal of replacing the Space Shuttle. NASA must evaluate new designs and technologies with the objective of improving upon today's Shuttle cost, performance, and turnaround time, before the government or commercial organizations pursue the large undertaking of a new launch system. To address this issue, the Generic Simulation Environment for Modelling Future Launch Operations (GEM-FLO) was developed to accurately predict processing turnaround times and other effectiveness criteria and support making key business and program decisions. GEM-FLO utilizes a generic modelling paradigm to provide a single platform for modelling different designs, which helped significantly cut the cost of these studies. This paper documents a success story in generic simulation modelling.

AB A technique for computationally determining the thermophysical properties of high-energy-density matter propellants is presented. High-energy-density matter compounds are of interest in the liquid rocket engine industry due to their high-density and high-energy content relative to existing industry-standard propellants. To accurately model rocket engine performance, cost, and weight in a conceptual design environment, several thermodynamic and physical properties are required over a range of temperatures and pressures. The approach presented here combines quantum mechanical and molecular dynamic calculations and group additivity methods. A method for improving the force field model coefficients used in the molecular dynamics simulations is included. This approach is used to determine thermophysical properties for two high-energy-density matter compounds of interest: quadricyclane and 2-azido-N, N-dimethylethanamine. The modified force field approach provides results that more accurately match experimental data than the unmodified approach. Launch vehicle and lunar lander case studies are presented to quantify the system-level impact of employing quadricyclane and 2-azido-N, N-dimethylethanamine rather than industry-standard propellants. In both cases, the use of high-energy-density matter propellants provides reductions in vehicle mass compared with industry-standard propellants. The results demonstrate that high-energy-density matter propellants can be an attractive technology for future launch vehicle and lunar lander applications.

TI An evaluation of high velocity wear
SO WEAR
LA English
DT Article
DE high velocity wear; Holloman High Speed Test Track
ID IMPACT; VALIDATION
AB The Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) is a rocket-powered sled track facility used for testing a variety of hypervelocity aerospace applications at speeds approaching 3000 m/s. Research conducted at the HHSTT has to consider several features that result from the physics of high velocity. The feature of gouging has been noted to be a significant factor at speeds above 1.5 km/s. This characteristic has been studied in recent years by several authors including the senior author of this paper. Another feature that is always present is that of wear between the shoe and the rail resulting from their sporadic contact as the sled travels down the rail. This paper attempts to establish a proof concept that can eventually be extended into future understanding of wear at high velocities. The authors approached wear using two separate techniques. The first technique involves the use of equations that have been successfully used to represent wear at low speeds. This technique relies on the research of Lim and Ashby and the equations they developed to model the different modes of wear. Included in this technique is the use of Archard's wear equation. The second technique, completely independent of the first, relies on the physics of frictional movement displayed by a model produced using CTH, a hydrocode developed by Sandia National Laboratory for analyzing hypervelocity impact problems. This technique considers features that are potentially present in the overall phenomenon but are limited to the use of the code. The authors have found it necessary to make simplifying assumptions in both techniques, but the end result is a better appreciation of what is needed to put together a more accurate model of wear at high velocities.

AB This report presents recent research activities of the Combined Propulsion Research Group of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Aerodynamics and combusion of the scramjet engine and the rocket-ramjet combined-cycle engine. structure and material for the two engines and thermo-aerodynamic of a re-entry vehicle are major subjects. In Mach 6 condition tests a scramjet engine model produced about 2000 N net thrust, whereas a model produced thrust almost equal to its drag in Mach 12 condition. A flight test of a combustor model was conducted with Hyshot-IV.

TI Conceptual design assessment of a suborbital tourist space access
   vehicle
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Space transportation remains in the pioneering stages. What might this century bring if we had a 'railroad to space' that embodied the characteristics of the transcontinental undertaking? The X-33 and Venture Star projects were one attempt to achieve the characteristics of that transcontinental railroad. There are others, here and in other Countries, but perhaps we need to begin with a smaller first step, a small, commercial reusable rocket with ballistic ascent to space altitude with a hypersonic glider return? Our challenge in space today is to develop vehicles that are in continuous use, maintained and operated on a fixed schedule despite weather or environmental hazards, which move payloads not only into space but back again. The X PRIZE was a $10 million prize awarded to Scaled Composites as the first privately financed spaceship that launched the equivalent of three persons to an altitude of at least 100 kilometers on two consecutive flights within two weeks. What about an analogous vehicle that flies two or three times a week, every week for a number of years? A major difference is that this challenge is to be accomplished without government support or government developed vehicles. The aerospace vehicle design (AVD) Laboratory team at the University of Texas at Arlington is developing a generic space access vehicle (SAV) design synthesis environment with focus on the conceptual design phase. The AVD Lab has applied elements of this toolbox to the study of a tourist aerospace vehicle under a grant from Rocketplane Limited, Inc. The development of a low-cost tourist vehicle based on the adaptation of a Learjet 25/35/45 series aircraft is the focus of this paper.

AB Fatalities related to sporting events are predominantly caused by blunt force injuries especially due to the emotional involvement of crowd, but occasionally other types of trauma are reported as well. A case of very rare trauma caused by shooting with a hand-held parachute signal rocket during a football match is presented. A 17-year-old football fan sustained fatal injuries, a combination of mechanical trauma caused by rocket penetration, as well as extensive thermal burning of the thoracic viscera. Analysis of the event was based on autopsy findings and evidence produced by medicolegal and ballistic experts. Improper use of a hand-held signal rocket, designed for marine distress signals, may cause serious injuries either mechanically, due to explosion, or as a result of thermal discharge. In the reported case, pattern of injuries is discussed, and medical finding corroborated to other available evidence. The presented case is a reminder that the forensic pathologist should be informed accordingly on the type and features of weapon suspected to produce injury, to be able to understand traumatic changes, and look for potential presence of foreign bodies at postmortem examination.

AB The water-gas shift reaction influences the chemistry between the postcombustion gases of a rocket and the rocket's graphite nozzle. The rocket's operating pressures (70-600 atm) exceed those for existing water-gas shift reaction data, and further study of the chemistry undersimilar conditions is essential for optimum rocket design. To investigate chemical kinetic effects at the pertinent pressure and temperature regime, experiments were performed using the University of Illinois atChicago high-pressure shock-tube facility with experimental temperatures ranging from 1200-2100 K and pressures ranging from 194-490 atm with reaction times averaging 1.17 ms. Initial mole fractions of H2O and CO were varied from 115-983 ppm (0.0002-0.003 mol/L).The experimental data have been compared with predictions from a comprehensive model for synthesis gas (CO/H-2/CO2) combustion and a reduced four-step model with the chemistry relevant to the water-gas shift reaction. The rate coefficients at our elevated pressure and temperature conditions were found to be pressure independent when compared with prior lower temperature 1 atm measurements.

AB An established method to simulate the aerodynamic effects on in situ sounding rocket measurements is the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. However, very few three-dimensional steady and unsteady simulations with high resolution along a rocket trajectory exist. This study provides three-dimensional steady and unsteady simulations applied to the Second Coupling of Dynamics and Aurora experiment. The results show the validity of a steady-state approach through quantitative comparisons of steady and unsteady simulation results near the rocket's apogee. Steady-state solutions of the flowfield are presented at 2 km intervals along both the upleg and downleg trajectories. The numerical simulations verify the experimental results showing the strong influence of rocket orientation on concentration. Atomic oxygen correction factors, based on the ratio of undisturbed to disturbed flowfield concentrations, are obtained from the numerical results and applied to the experimental sensor data. These correction factors, when applied to uncorrected Second Coupling of Dynamics and Aurora data sets, show a significant improvement over previous research results, particularly along the upleg trajectory, in terms of minimizing the effects of compressible How aerodynamics on the atomic oxygen data.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

ID LAUNCH VEHICLE; OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION
AB Data mining has been performed on the result,; of an aerodynamic design optimization of a two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle flyback-booster wing. Three data mining techniques were compared, including selforganizing map, functional analysis of variance, and the rough set theory. The optimization problem had four aerodynamic objective functions and 71 wing shape design variables. The hypothetical design database resulting from the optimization contained a total of 302 solutions which included 102 nondominated solutions. Consequently, the acquired knowledge of the design space consisted of general design characteristics, correlation between objective functions, and the effects of these design variables on the objective functions, for both nondominated as well as all solutions. The comparison also revealed the similarities and differences among the three data mining techniques used in this study. Even though all three techniques discovered detailed design knowledge and the results produced by the combination of all three methods compensated disadvantages of each method when applied individually, it was discovered that the self-organizing map produced the overall best results. Moreover, this study has also shown that the knowledge acquired from both nondominated solutions and from all solutions found was consistent despite the differences between the design spaces. Furthermore, it was shown that data mining is essential for visualizing results of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem and extracting useful design knowledge from these results.

AB Currently, the rocket propulsion industry uses an empirical curve fit to predict the hybrid rocket fuel regression rates. These "after the fact" correlations are of little use for predicting the performance of new fuel formulations or grain designs. This paper develops a refined model for predicting hybrid motor fuel regression rates using an enthalpy balance in which fuel-grain ablation heat is balanced by convective heat transfer from the combustion flame zone to the fuel-grain surface. Convective heat transfer is related to the surface skin friction using the Colburn heat-transfer/skin-friction analogy for nonunity Prandtl numbers. Because the Prandtl number is a measure of the relative importance of skin friction and heat transfer within a viscous flowfield, it has a significant effect on the resulting regression rates. The regression model calculates the longitudinally averaged fuel regression rate and is shown to accurately predict chamber pressure, thrust, and specific impulse of a medium-scale hybrid rocket motor. Chemical properties of the combustion products were evaluated using the NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications combustion code. Model predictions for a nitrous oxide (N2O) and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene motor are compared with data from a small-scale test firing with a 10.2-cm-diam motor.

AB The International Space Station will require a continuous supply of replacement parts for ongoing maintenance and repair after the planned retirement of the space shuttle in 2010. These parts are existing line-replaceable items collectively called orbital replacement units, and include heavy and oversized items such as control moment gyroscopes and stowed radiator arrays originally intended for delivery aboard the space shuttle. Current resupply spacecraft have limited to no capability to deliver these external logistics. In support of NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study, a team at Langley Research Center designed an unpressurized cargo delivery vehicle to deliver bulk cargo to the space station. This vehicle was required to deliver at least 13,200 lb of cargo mounted on at least 18 flight releasable attachment mechanisms. The crew launch vehicle design recommended in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study would be used to launch one annual resupply flight to the International Space Station. The baseline vehicle design has a cargo capacity of 16,000 lb mounted on up to 20 flight releasable attachment mechanisms. Major vehicle components are an 18.0 ft-diam cargo module containing two detachable pallets with the payload, a service module to provide propulsion and power, and a jettisonable nose cone. To reduce cost and risk, the service module is identical to the one used for the crew exploration vehicle design.

AB International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), a joint project of URSI and COSPAR, is the de facto international standard for the climatological specification of ionospheric parameters and as such it is currently undergoing registration as Technical Specification (TS) of the International Standardization Organization (ISO). IRI by charter and design is an empirical model based on a wide range of ground and space data. It describes monthly averages of ionospheric densities and temperatures in the altitude range 50-1500 km in the non-auroral ionosphere. Since its inception in 1969 the IRI model has been steadily improved with newer data and with better mathematical descriptions of global and temporal variation patterns. A large number of independent studies have validated the IRI model in comparisons with direct and indirect ionospheric measurements not used in the model development. A comparison with IRI is often one of the first science tasks by an ionospheric satellite or rocket team.
   This paper describes the latest version of the IRI model, IRI-2007, explaining the most important changes that are being introduced with this version. These include: (1) two new options for the topside electron density, (2) a new model for the topside ion composition, (3) the first-time inclusion of a model for the spread F occurrence probability, (4) a NeuralNet model for auroral E-region electron densities, (5) a model for the plasmaspheric electron temperature, and (6) the latest International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model for the computation of magnetic coordinates including their changes due to the secular variation of the magnetic field.

DE hybrid rocket; air launch vehicles; optimal design
AB A feasibility study and the optimal design was conducted for the application of a hybrid motor with HTPB/LOX combination to the first stage of an air launch system. The feasibility analysis showed that the hybrid motor could successfully be used as a substitute for the solid rocket motor of the first stage of the Pegasus XL if the average specific impulse (I-sp) of the hybrid motor could be approximately 350sec. And the optimal design of the hybrid motor was carried out for a given mission requirement with selected design variables: number of ports, initial oxidizer flux, combustion chamber pressure, and nozzle expansion ratio. The design results show the hybrid motor call be Successfully applicable to the air launching vehicle. And, the optimal design can meet physical constraints of length and diameter imposed by the mother plane installation for a 3.5kg nano-sat to the orbit located on the 200x1500km elliptic orbit plane. Also, it was found that the design results would provide nearly the same design configurations regardless of the selection of objective functions:either mass or length of the engine.

SO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN JAPAN

   controller state; integrator
AB When a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) returns to earth, it flies just by gliding without thrust. In this phase, one of the most likely and important faults to occur in the airframe is a jamming of the elevon. To tolerate this failure, the flight control system must keep stability and performance during such a failure. One of the effective ways to overcome this problem is to switch the controllers based on the information of the detected failure in the plant. Generally speaking, the controller must have integrators so as to yield the zero steady-state error for the controlled Output even if there exist some perturbations in the plant dynamics. In this paper, the design of controller switching scenario is addressed especially focusing on the decision of the controller state at the instant of switching the controllers wit integrator. Then, the proposed switching scenario is applied to the control of ALFLEX (Automatic Landing FLight EXperiment), which is the automatic landing experimental vehicle being developed for RLV, considering the occurrence of the jamming fault. Some simulations are shown to verify the usefulness of the proposed idea. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Further study for the planning of the post SELENE mission has been discussed by a dedicated working group. As the extension of the SELENE-B study [Okada, T., Sasaki, S., Sugihara, T., et al. Lander and rover exploration on the lunar surface: a study for SELENE-B mission. Adv. Space Res. 37, 88-92, 2006] which proposed in-situ geological investigations using a robotic rover and a static lander, this report newly proposes a revised configuration which enhances the scientific field of view. The spacecraft of this mission, "SELENE-II", is designed as a full payload of H-II launch vehicle, while the former study was designed as a half payload of the same vehicle. This expansion of capacity enabled us to increase the payload mass of the lander to deploy geophysical instruments and to land on a wider region on the Moon including polar regions. We also gained the opportunity to deploy two penetrators in order to make a wide network for geophysical observations. In the new configuration, this mission can install three stations of a global seismic network, which will be able to refine the deeper structure of the Moon. In this study also, a new type of deployment system, whose mechanical interface is much simpler than that of the LUNA R-A mission, is preliminarily designed.
   The selection of the landing site is still undergoing discussion, but the lander is required to operate as long as about one year and more for the geophysical observations, especially for seismology. In order to realize this, one possible idea is to land in permanently sunlit regions. Polar regions also have a benefit from the geological point of view; the north polar region is a typical high land area and the south one is a part of or adjacent to the South Pole Aitken (SPA), where the deeper part of the crust or the mantle material are expected to be collected.
   In addition to the lander scientific instruments designed previously (Okada et al., 2006.) for the geological survey, a broad band seismometer is considered to be deployed prior to other geophysical instruments and we expect it to provide us with information about the bulk layered structure with only one station if free oscillations are successfully detected. Even if the free oscillations cannot be detected, the dispersion of surface waves not affected by scattering of the regolith or megaregolith layer brings information to understand the crustal and upper mantle structures.
   Several landing missions are planned by NASA, CNSA, ISRO, and ESA by 2010-2015 during which the operational period is possible to be overlapped by the different missions. This must be a great opportunity to make larger network observations in the future. It must be a great opportunity to start international collaboration in various ways for the upcoming lunar exploration era. (c) 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human exploration and development of space is being pursued by spacefaring nations to explore, use, and enable the development of space and expand the human experience there. The goals include: increasing human knowledge of nature's processes using the space environment; exploring and settling the solar system; achieving routine space travel; and enriching life on Earth through living and working in space. A crucial aspect of future space missions is the development of infrastructure to optimize safety, productivity, and costs. A major component of mission execution is operations management. NASA's International Space Station is providing extensive experience in both infrastructure and operations. In view of this, a vigorously organized approach is needed to implement successful space-, planet-, and ground-based research and operations that entails wise and efficient use of technical and human resources.
   Many revolutionary technologies being pursued by researchers and technologists may be vital in making space missions safe, reliable, cost-effective, and productive. These include: ionic polymer-metal composite technology; solid-state lasers; time-domain sensors and communication systems; high-temperature superconductivity; nanotechnology; variable specific impulse magneto plasma rocket; fuzzy logic; wavelet technology; and neural networks. An overview of some of these will be presented, along with their application to space missions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a technical and programmatic overview of the VEGA launch system program currently in development for the European Space Agency, which includes the development and qualification activities of the small launcher VEGA, of the ground infrastructure, and of all the launcher elements. Several programmatic milestones have been successfully achieved so far: most subsystems have gone through the critical design review or qualification review. The launcher system critical design review has been performed during spring 2007 as well. Concerning propulsion, all the three development models of the solid rocket motors have been successfully tested between December 2005 and December 2006. The first qualification model engine of the liquid propulsion upper module has successfully completed its firing campaign and the test campaign for the second model has just started. The liquid upper stage AVUM engine has been tested as well. The VEGA ground segment program has entered its final lapse by completing the detailed design of the various subsystems. The installation phase in the launch range site (Kourou, French Guyane) is in full swing. The integration of the Mobile Gantry, necessary to integrate the launcher, is almost completed as for the main structure. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB On the 28th November 2002, Algeria's first enhanced micro satellite was launched into a 686 km low earth orbit onboard a Cosmos 3M rocket from Plesetsk. The spacecraft was designed, manufactured and launched as a technology transfer programme between the National Centre of Space Techniques (CNTS) Algeria and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) United Kingdom in the timescale of 18 months.
   This paper will describe the design and in orbit performance of the mission power system, stressing the decisions taken in order to meet the mission requirements within the 18 months, concept to launch programme.
   Most of the design and construction techniques used in the production of the Alsat-1 power system were based on SSTL heritage over the years. It will be shown how off the shelf components either for the generation or storage of the onboard energy can be applied successfully to such missions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The experiment was carried out in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, aiming to evaluate the effect of the intercropping on endive and rocket yields. The 11 treatments were constituted from endive and rocket intercropping, established at 0; 5; 10; 15 and 20 days after the endive transplant (DAET) and also the monocultures for all time of intercropping. The experimental design were randomized complete blocks, with eleven treatments and four replications. Independent of sowing time of rocket, the endive yield was not influenced. The fresh matter of the aerial part of the rocket (FMR) was significantly influenced by the interaction of the assessed factors. The later sowing of the rocket in relation to the chicory transplant, the smaller was FMR. The production of FMR in intercropping didn't differ from that obtained in monoculture when the sowing of the rocket was accomplished at 10 DAT of endive. The best intercropping in terms of efficient use of the area (EUA = 2.29), net revenue (R$ 75,873,09/ ha) and rate of return (R-R = 14.17) was obtained when the rocket sowing in intercropping was established on the same day as the chicory transplant.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER

DE heat flux; input estimation method; finite-element scheme
ID INPUT ESTIMATION APPROACH; FINITE-ELEMENT SCHEME; CONDUCTION PROBLEMS
AB During the missile flight, the jet flow with high temperature comes from the heat flux of propellant burning. An enormous heat flux from the nozzle throat-insert inner contour conducted into the nozzle shell will degrade the material strength of nozzle shell and reduce the nozzle thrust efficiency. In this paper, an on-line inverse method based on the input estimation method combined with the finite-element scheme is proposed to inversely estimate the unknown heat flux on the nozzle throat-insert inner contour and the inner wall temperature by applying the temperature measurements of the nozzle throat-insert. The finite-element scheme can easily define the irregularly shaped boundary. The superior capability of the proposed method is demonstrated in two major time-varying estimation cases. The computational results show that the proposed method has good estimation performance and highly facilitates the practical implementation. An effective analytical method can be offered to increase the operation reliability and thermal-resistance layer design in the solid rocket motor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes an effort to optimize the design of an entire space launch vehicle to low Earth (circular) orbit, consisting of multiple stages using a genetic algorithm with the goal of minimizing vehicle weight and ultimately vehicle cost. The entire launch vehicle system is analyzed using various multistage configurations to reach low Earth orbit. Specifically, three- and four-stage solid propellant vehicles have been analyzed. The vehicle performance modeling requires that analysis from four separate disciplines be integrated into the design optimization process. The disciplines of propulsion characteristics, aerodynamics, mass properties, and flight dynamics have been integrated to produce a high-fidelity system model of the entire vehicle. In addition, the system model has been validated using the existing launch vehicle data. The cost model is mass based and uses extensive historical data to produce a cost estimating relationship for a solid propellant vehicle. For the design optimization, the goal is for the genetic algorithm to minimize the differences between the desired and actual orbital parameters. This ensures that the payload achieves the desired orbit. One final goal is to minimize the overall vehicle mass, thus minimizing the system cost per launch. This paper will represent the first effort of its kind to minimize the solid propellant launch vehicle cost at the preliminary design level using a genetic algorithm.

DE zero g; suspension system; clamp band separation test; nonlinear motion
AB This paper presents a mathematical model of the spacecraft motion during the separation test on a low frequency suspension system that is designed and fabricated in order to simulate the free fall condition of the spacecraft as it occurs in space during the spacecraft separation from the launch vehicle. The suspension system consisted of elastic bungee cords to hold the spacecraft in course of the separation process during the test. The model, developed here to predict the parameters of the rigid-body separation dynamics, incorporates the effect of ejection springs and nonlinear behavior of the bungee cords. The Lagrange method was used to drive the equations of motion and was solved using forth order Runge-Kutta method. Separation tests were carried on structural model of spacecraft by releasing the clamp-band. The displacement of the spacecraft was measured by a high accuracy Laser Tracker. The predicted response of the spacecraft matches closely with the test data.

AB As a part of the Korea National Space Program, the Korean government has led the Sounding Rocket Program by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) providing enhanced capabilities across a spectrum of earth sciences and/or astrophysics-related disciplines. In this paper, the Korean Sounding Rocket Program during 1993-2002 is introduced. This program includes Korea Sounding Rocket (KSR)-I, KSR-II, and KSR-III, and a total of five soundings were carried out. Two had flown in KSR-I series. two in KSR-II, and one in KSR-III. The main mission objective is to provide the opportunity to scientists for researching earth sciences and/or astrophysics and to improve Korean rocket development technologies including payload instruments, flight systems, ground systems, operational techniques, and interfaces between subsystems. As demand increased for launching of low-orbit earth satellites internally and externally, the Korean government was ambitiously firing the Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV) Program in 2002, based on experience throughout the Sounding Rocket Program and preparing the world market for space launch vehicles.

AB Disturbance is a well-recognized catalyst of exotic species invasion, depriving or releasing resources into communities and favoring the spread of some invaders. Hesperis matronalis (dame's rocket) is widespread in North America and has potential to become a major problem in natural communities due to anthropogenic influences. We used a target-neighbor design in a greenhouse to grow H. matronalis and native seedlings (Campanula rotundifolia and Muhlenbergia montana) at various levels of neighbor density, nitrogen and water. H. matronalis clearly reduced C. rotundifolia and M. montana aboveground growth and maintained its competitive advantage across all treatments. We expected H. matronalis to maximize its growth and have the greatest negative effect on native species under high resource conditions because ruderal species are able to take advantage of excess resources. H. matronalis demonstrated a clearly negative effect on native species, but a particular ability to outcompete native species at high resource levels depended on resource and native species identity. We also expected that the native species would not exploit excess resources as well as H. matronalis, instead growing better under ambient or low resource conditions because of local adaptation. Rather, M. montana benefited from high water inputs, inconsistent with plant strategies characteristic of stress tolerators. Information on the effects of H. matronalis on native plants in a controlled setting may aid land managers to understand its potential effects in natural communities.

AB Schemes have been suggested for transferring energy from Earth-to-space, space-to-Earth, and space-to-space using high-power microwave (HPM) beams. All use power beaming. Microwave beams have been studied for propelling spacecraft for launch to orbit, orbit raising, launch from orbit into interplanetary and interstellar space, and deployment of large space structures. The microwave thermal rocket, called the "microwave thermal thruster," is a reusable single-stage vehicle that uses an HIM beam to provide power to a heat-exchanger propulsion system, with double the specific impulse of conventional rockets. Orbital missions include orbit raising and space solar power. Microwave-propelled sails are a new class of spacecraft that promises to revolutionize future space probes. Experiments and simulations have verified that sails riding beams can be stable on the beam for conical sail shapes. Beam-driven sail flights have now demonstrated the basic features of the beam-driven propulsion. Beams can also carry angular momentum and communicate it to a sail to help control it in flight. An early mission for microwave space propulsion is dramatically shortening the time needed for sails to escape Earth's orbit. A number of missions for beam-driven sails have been quantified for high-velocity mapping of the outer solar system, Kuiper Belt, the Heliopause, and the penultimate interstellar precursor mission. For large HIM systems at fixed effective isotropic radiated power, minimum capital cost is achieved when the cost is equally divided between antenna gain and radiated power. This is a driver when considering design of power-beaming systems such as interstellar Beacons, which the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence is searching for. Much of the technical means for these applications are already in hand. Microwave and millimeter-wave array antennas are already in use for astronomy; sources at high frequencies are being developed for fusion and the military. Development of high-power arrays is needed. A synergistic way to develop a space power-beaming infrastructure is incremental buildup, addressing lower power applications first, and then upgrading.

AB The static and dynamic stability of an elastically restrained Beck column with an attached end mass subjected simultaneously to gravity and follower axial forces is presented. The analytical Solution takes into account the simultaneous effects of: (1) translational and rotational elastic restraints Lit the base support; (2) the uniform mass per unit length of the column (including any additional uniformly distributed mass) and rotary inertia of the column; (3) the rotary and translational inertias of the attached end mass; (4) the distance from the centroid of the attached end mass to the column free end; and (5) the shear deformation. The analytical eigenvalue solution can be used to study these effects on the static and dynamic stability of the Beck column. The analytical method and eigenvalue equation capture the static buckling (or divergence) as well Lis the dynamic (flutter) instability of cantilever columns elastically restrained at the base and subjected to any combinations of gravity and follower compressive axial forces applied Lit the free end. A parametric study is carried out on the effects of the translational and rotational inertias of the end mass, the distance from the centroid of the attached end mass to the column free end, and the rotational restraint on the static and dynamic stability of a perfectly clamped Beck column. Four comprehensive examples are presented to show the simplicity and effectiveness of the analytical method, and the obtained results compared with those obtained analytically and experimentally by others researchers.

TI Variable cutoff frequency pre-modulation filter for PCM/FM transmission
   system
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE FIR; frequency response; interpolation; PCM/FM; pre-modulation
AB The purpose of this study is to design, analyze and calibrate a pre-modulation filter with a variable cutoff frequency property for the PCM/FM transmission system. The effect of the pre-modulation filter reduces the energy contained in the sidebands of the modulated carrier. Most existing filters are based on a constant cutoff frequency specification. The onboard units of the launch vehicle which have been performed by the functional and environmental tests should not be revised by any hardware modifications from a reliability point of view. In case of the VCU in this paper, it is necessary to change the PCM bit rate and the cutoff frequency of the pre-modulation filter with software programming in order to improve the picture quality in the allowable bandwidth even if the unit has already been manufactured. In addition, the link margin around the satellite separation event is very low because the flight range is more than 2000 km. Under the same RF power condition, the reduction of the transmitting data rate will result in an increase of link margin. For this, the pre-modulation filter should have the variable cutoff frequency property with software programmable function according to 0.7 times the data rate. The variable cutoff frequency pre-modulation filter consists of a digital FIR filter, a DAC system and a tunable 2nd order LPF to meet the magnitude frequency response of an analog 7th order Bessel LPF The attenuation requirements of three sub-blocks are generated by the frequency response analysis and the linear phase features are also taken into account for each stage. And the analog conversion part including a DAC system and a tunable 2nd order LPF is verified and calibrated using a tone generator.

TI Numerical simulation for vortex structure in a turbopump inducer: Close
   relationship with appearance of cavitation instabilities
SO JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
DE CFD; inducer; vortex structure; rotating cavitation; cavitation surge
AB Unsteady cavitation phenomena such as rotating cavitation and cavitation surge are often observed in a turbopump inducer of a rocket engine, sometimes causing undesirable oscillation of the system. Investigation of their mechanism and prediction of such unsteady phenomena are, therefore, crucial in the design of inducers. As many experiments have shown, the appearance of cavitation instability is highly related to the flow rate as well as to the inlet casing geometry. Experimental observations have shown that a very complex flow structure, including such phenomena as backflow and vortices, appears upstream of the inducer. In this work, therefore, we conducted 3D unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations of noncavitating flow in a turbopump inducer, mainly focusing on the vortex structure, for three types of inlet casing geometry with various flow rates. Simulation results showed that the vortex structure for the geometry of the inlet casing and that for the flow rate differed. Especially, it was found that development of the tip leakage vortex was dependent on the inlet casing geometry and the flow rate. This tendency is analogous to that observed between the appearance of rotating cavitation and the casing geometry and flow rate in cavitation tunnel tests. This result strongly implies that the tip leakage vortex is responsible for the appearance of rotating cavitation. By adding a gutter to the inlet casing, it was found that backflow was completely confined to the gutter regardless of flow rates. This numerical result implies that the volume of cavity generated in the backflow region should be stable despite a change of the flow rate, resulting in the suppression of increase of the mass flow gain factor. This result also supports the experimental result that cavitation surge was effectively suppressed using such a casing with a gutter.

ID OPTIMIZATION; COMBUSTION
AB A nested direct/indirect method is used to find the optimal design for a microgravity platform which is based on a hybrid sounding rocket. The direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with the indirect trajectory optimization to maximize a given mission performance index. A gas-pressure feed system is used, with three different propellant combinations. The feed system exploits a pressurizing gas, namely, helium, when hydrogen peroxide or liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant propellant tank pressure. Only self-pressurization is considered with nitrous oxide; two different models are used to describe the behavior of the tank pressurization. The simplest model assumes liquid/vapor equilibrium. A two-phase model is also proposed: Saturated vapor and superheated liquid are considered and the liquid/vapor mass transfer evaluation is based on the liquid spinodal line. Results show that the different tank-pressurization models yield minimal differences of the optimal motor characteristics. Performance differs slightly due to the different mass of the residual oxidizer. The propellant comparison for the present case shows better performance for hydrogen peroxide/ polyethylene with respect to liquid oxygen/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, while nitrous oxide/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene remains attractive for system simplicity and low costs.

AB In the present paper, the use of advanced catalytic beds on ceramic supports as a cost-effective alternative to metal screen reactors for the decomposition of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide in small monopropellant rockets is investigated. For this purpose, a reconfigurable test bench for the characterization of the operation and the propulsive performance of small rocket thrusters has been designed and realized. The present paper illustrates the experimental campaign carried out on a 5 N thruster prototype operating with two platinum catalysts on gamma-alumina supporting spheres. The results indicated that Pt/Al2O3 is an effective catalyst combination for the decomposition of 87.5% propellant-grade hydrogen peroxide, with good stability and performance comparable to silver screen beds of equal geometric envelope and operational conditions. Incomplete hydrogen peroxide decomposition and the onset of flow oscillations in the reactor were observed at the tested levels of bed loading, residence time, and flow pressure. Thermal stresses due to the large temperature gradients occurring during the decomposition of high-grade hydrogen peroxide (87.5% by weight) caused the ceramic pellets to break and the progressive occlusion of the bed. Based on the analysis of the test results, several ways to overcome these problems in future investigations have been tentatively identified, together with the necessary modifications to the present experimental setup.

AB This work provides an assessment of an experimental method for characterizing combustion stability of liquid rocket injectors. The research has shown that the single-element laboratory scale methodology is capable of creating high-frequency combustion instability with gaseous methane and oxygen. Modified pentad impinging jet injectors were selected for the stability survey. The maximum peak-to-peak dynamic pressure recorded in the chamber was 27% of the mean chamber pressure. Other factors indicating instability include injector manifold pressure pulsations as well as twofold chamber temperature increases from steady operation. The testing evidenced that the flame structure varies with the onset of unstable combustion as well as mode transition. Moreover, a bifurcation process was seen as the dominant frequency shifted. The results also showed that there were significant differences in stability characteristics which were a function of fuel impingement angle. Correlation with chamber natural frequency predictions suggest that the injectors excited the first radial mode and the first radial, second tangential combined mode.

ID OPTIMUM THRUST; CONTOUR
AB For ideal nozzles, basically two different types of shock structures in the plume may appear for overexpanded flow conditions, a regular shock reflection or a Mach reflection at the nozzle centreline. Especially for rocket propulsion, other nozzle types besides the ideal nozzles are often used, including simple conical, thrust-optimized or parabolic contoured nozzles. Depending on the contour type, another shock structure may appear: the so-called cap-shock pattern. The exact knowledge of the plume pattern is of importance for mastering the engine operation featuring uncontrolled flow separation inside the nozzle, appearing during engine start-up and shut-down operation. As consequence of uncontrolled flow separation, lateral loads may be induced. The side-load character strongly depends on the nozzle design, and is a key feature for the nozzle's mechanical structure layout. It is shown especially for the VULCAIN and VULCAIN 2 nozzle, how specific shock patterns evolve during transients, and how - by the nozzle design - undesired flow phenomena can be avoided.

AB Rudolf Hermann was born on December 15, 1904 in Leipzig, Germany. He studied at the University of Leipzig and at the Aachen Institute of Technology. His involvement with wind tunnels began in 1934 when Professor Carl Wieselsberger engaged him to work at Aachen on the development of a supersonic wind tunnel. On January 6, 1936, Dr. Wernher von Braun visited Dr. Hermann to arrange for use of the Aachen supersonic wind tunnel for Army problems. On April 1, 1937, Dr. Hermann became Director of the Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the Army installation at Peenemunde. Results from the Aachen and Peenemunde wind tunnels were crucial in achieving aerodynamic stability for the A-4 rocket, later designated as the V-2. Plans to build a Mach 10 'hypersonic' wind tunnel facility at Kochel were accelerated after the Allied air raid on Peenemunde on August 17, 1943. Dr. Hermann was director of the new facility. Ignoring destruction orders from Hitler as WWII approached an end in Europe, Dr. Hermann and his associates hid documents and preserved wind tunnel components that were acquired by the advancing American forces. Dr. Hermann became a consultant to the Air Force at its Wright Field in November 1945. In 1951, he was named professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. In 1962, Dr. Hermann became the first Director of the Research Institute at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), a position he held until he retired in 1970. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

His involvement with wind tunnels began in 1934 when Professor Carl Wieselsberger engaged him to work at Aachen on the development of a supersonic wind tunnel. On January 6, 1936, Dr. Wernher von Braun visited Dr. Hermann to arrange for use of the Aachen supersonic wind tunnel for Army problems. On April 1, 1937, Dr. Hermann became Director of the Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the Army installation at Peenemunde. Results from the Aachen and Peenemunde wind tunnels were crucial in achieving aerodynamic stability for the A-4 rocket, later designated as the V-2. Plans to build a Mach 10 'hypersonic' wind tunnel facility at Kochel were accelerated after the Allied air raid on Peenemunde on August 17, 1943. Dr. Hermann was director of the new facility. Ignoring destruction orders from Hitler as WWII approached an end in Europe, Dr. Hermann and his associates hid documents and preserved wind tunnel components that were acquired by the advancing American forces. Dr. Hermann became a consultant to the Air Force at its Wright Field in November 1945. In 1951, he was named professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. In 1962, Dr. Hermann became the first Director of the Research Institute at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), a position he held until he retired in 1970. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called multiple start guided neighbourhood search (MSGNS) algorithm for combinatorial optimisation which combines the good features of popular guided local search algorithms like simulated annealing and tabu search. It has been organized as a multiple start algorithm to maintain a good balance between intensification and diversification. The proposed hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm has been employed to solve optimal stacking sequence design problem of laminate composite structures. First, the algorithm has been employed to solve the problem of optimal stacking sequence of a composite plate for which the results of various algorithms are available in the literature. This study is basically to validate and also to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over several existing meta-heuristic algorithms.
   Later, a practical design example of fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt of solid rocket motor of aerospace vehicle is investigated. A skirt is a potential element for weight reduction in rocket motors as it leads to reduction of the total weight of solid rocket motor. Due to its significance for solid rocket motors, it is proposed to optimise the weight as well as cost of the fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt subjected to a buckling strength constraint and an overstressing strength constraint under aerodynamic torque and axial thrust. This is achieved by arriving at an optimal stacking sequence for the cylinder satisfying all the design constraints and also by employing multiple composite materials. Classical laminate theory combining with elastic stability theory of thin shells is used to arrive at buckling strength and overstressing strength of the fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt. The Tsai-Wu failure criterion is employed to assess the first ply failure. Buckling strength and failure strength of the cylindrical skirt is described by using buckling load factor and overstressing load level factor. Numerical simulations carried out in this paper clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MSGNS algorithm over the popularly used combinatorial algorithms like genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

AB A solution to the problem of model-free intelligent attitude control of aerospace launch vehicles is presented. Emphasis is placed on the development of learning the proper action through reinforcement learning for problems that have no model or in which the model is too complex. One approach to solving this class of problems is via motivation from emotional learning mechanism in the mammalian brain. A simple but effective mathematical model from the emotional learning mechanism in the human brain is presented and developed to solve the closed-loop command tracking problem. The emotional learning mechanism needs a set of sensory inputs and a reinforcing signal to produce action. Determination and tuning of the parameters of the reinforcing signal and sensory input are left to be solved through evolution by a genetic algorithm. It is shown in simulations that the mathematical model of the emotional learning mechanism can be initialized as a powerful feedback control algorithm.

AB Following the completion of NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study in August 2004 for the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), the Ares Projects Office at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was assigned project management responsibilities for the design and development of the first vehicle in the architecture, the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), which will be used to launch astronauts to low earth orbit and rendezvous with either the International Space Station or the ESMD's earth departure stage for lunar or other future missions beyond low Earth orbit. The primary elements of the Ares I CLV project are the first stage, the upper stage, the upper stage engine, and vehicle integration. Within vehicle integration is an effort in integrated design and analysis which is comprised of a number of technical disciplines needed to support vehicle design and development. One of the important disciplines throughout the life of the project is aerodynamics. This paper will present the status, plans, and initial results of Ares I CLV aerodynamics as the project was preparing for the Ares I CLV Systems Requirements Review. Following a discussion of the specific interactions with other technical panels and a status of the current activities, the plans for aerodynamic support of the Ares I CLV until the initial crewed flights will be presented.

One is bridge condition on the concave surface and the other is slip line condition in the process of patch winding. This paper puts forward the judgmental principles and corresponsive solutions by applying differential geometry theory and space geometry theory. To validate the feasibility of the patch winding method, the winding control code is programmed. Furthermore, rocket engine crust experiment and vane winding experiment are carried out.

AB We have studied a potential design for a transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeter array for the Micro-X High Resolution Microcalorimeter X-ray Imaging Rocket. Diffusion simulations of a design that places a small TES in the center of the pixel with a large in-plane absorber around the TES demonstrate that with high-quality gold films (RRR > 6) 2 eV resolution is attainable in a 700 mu m pixel, meeting the Micro-X requirement. X-ray hits directly on the TES, however, create a non-gaussian high energy tail to the device response. This high energy tail contains 5% of incident photons and cannot be removed by lowering the optimal filter bandwidth.

SO SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE CME; solar; three-dimensional
AB The twin STEREO spacecraft were launched on October 26, 2006, at 00:52 UT from Kennedy Space Center aboard a Delta 7925 launch vehicle. After a series of highly eccentric Earth orbits with apogees beyond the moon, each spacecraft used close flybys of the moon to escape into orbits about the Sun near 1 AU. Once in heliospheric orbit, one spacecraft trails Earth while the other leads. As viewed from the Sun, the two spacecraft separate at approximately 44 to 45 degrees per year. The purposes of the STEREO Mission are to understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation and to follow the propagation of CMEs through the inner heliosphere to Earth. Researchers will use STEREO measurements to study the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration and to develop three-dimensional (3-D) time-dependent models of the magnetic topology, temperature, density and velocity of the solar wind between the Sun and Earth. To accomplish these goals, each STEREO spacecraft is equipped with an almost identical set of optical, radio and in situ particles and fields instruments provided by U.S. and European investigators. The SECCHI suite of instruments includes two white light coronagraphs, an extreme ultraviolet imager and two heliospheric white light imagers which track CMEs out to 1 AU. The IMPACT suite of instruments measures in situ solar wind electrons, energetic electrons, protons and heavier ions. IMPACT also includes a magnetometer to measure the in situ magnetic field strength and direction. The PLASTIC instrument measures the composition of heavy ions in the ambient plasma as well as protons and alpha particles. The S/WAVES instrument uses radio waves to track the location of CME-driven shocks and the 3-D topology of open field lines along which flow particles produced by solar flares. Each of the four instrument packages produce a small real-time stream of selected data for purposes of predicting space weather events at Earth. NOAA forecasters at the Space Environment Center and others will use these data in their space weather forecasting and their resultant products will be widely used throughout the world. In addition to the four instrument teams, there is substantial participation by modeling and theory oriented teams. All STEREO data are freely available through individual Web sites at the four Principal Investigator institutions as well as at the STEREO Science Center located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

AB The dynamics of a simply supported cylindrical shell submerged in liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are considered. The shell itself is bounded by a rigid outer cylinder with closed rigid ends. This configuration gives rise to two fluid-filled cavities-an inner cylindrical cavity. and an outer annular cavity. Such geometries are common in rocket engine design. The natural frequencies and modes of the fluid-structure system are computed by combining the rigid wall acoustic cavity modes and the in vacuo structural modes into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. Eigenvalue veering is observed near the intersections of the curves representing natural frequencies of the rigid wall acoustic and the in vacuo structural modes. In the case of a shell submerged in liquid hydrogen, system frequencies near these intersections are as much as 30% lower than the corresponding in vacuo structural frequencies. Because of its high density, the frequency reductions in the presence of liquid oxygen are even more dramatic. The forced responses of a shell submerged in liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, while subject to a harmonic point excitation, are also presented. The responses in the presence of fluid are found to be quite distinct from those of the structure in vacuo.

AB An experimental apparatus was designed and fabricated to measure the effective thermal conductivities and simulate the temperature and pressure history of reentry of a launch vehicle into a planetary atmosphere with a maximum temperature of 1600 degrees C An improved testing method was used to test the thermal conductivities of an alumina fibrous insulation at environmental pressures from 0.03 Pa to 10(5) Pa with the average temperature of the sample increased to 864 degrees C and its density being 128 kg/m(3). A method based on temperature difference is used to compute the in-plane effective thermal conductivity, and the result shows that the in-plane thermal conductivity along the y axis is 1.47 times that along the x axis. The influences of temperature and pressure on the contribution of three heat transfer mechanisms to the effective thermal conductivities were compared.

AB Anuran jumping is an ideal system for examining the relationships between key morphological, physiological, and kinematic parameters. We used the Australian rocket frog (Litoria nasuta) as a model species to investigate extreme specialization of the vertebrate locomotor system for jumping. We measured the ground reaction forces applied during maximal jumps using a custom-designed force platform, which allowed us to calculate instantaneous measures of acceleration, velocity, power output, and total jump distance. We quantified the mechanical properties of the plantaris longus muscle using the work loop technique. We found that L. nasuta achieved the second-longest relative jumping distance for any anuran (55.2 body lengths for one individual) and the highest published anuran values for isolated net mean muscle power output measured using work loops (93.5 W kg(-1) muscle mass), hindlimb length to snout-vent length ratio (2.02), and relative hindlimb muscle mass (33% of body mass). Litoria nasuta also had a higher ratio of tibia length to snout-vent length than 19 related species. We found that the mean power output expended during the takeoff phase of jumping in the individual that jumped the farthest was about three times greater than our estimate of available muscle power output.

DE space system verification
AB Having a solid verification program that ensures a "system is built right" plays a crucial role in both government and commercial space programs, since even the smallest error in a requirement, design/analysis, test, orinspection at every level of a system development could cause a major system malfunction and would be almost impossible to troubleshoot and repair once in space. According to the space/launch vehicles (SV/LVs) failure related data that have been collected by Aerospace Corporation since the 1960s, almost all of the post-launch failures could have been prevented if their problems had been discovered prior to the shipment of these vehicles to their launch sites. in particular, it was found that the majority of these vehicles could have been successful if deficiencies were corrected during early phase (requirement and design phases) or lower system level of their systems development. in general, any latent problems discovered later on in system development would significantly impact cost and schedule of space programs, even if they were successfully corrected prior to launch. This paper presents a systematic approach to planning and executing verification of space systems based on a distributed-space system verification program. it enforces a standardized set of modular-management processes at every level and phase of space system development activities. This distributed verification program approach tries to enforce a standard set of management processes in order to prevent Total System Program Responsibility (TSPR) philosophy, a "faster, better, cheaper" approach, from being unintentionally adopted at any level of space system development due to schedule and cost pressures. This space systems verification approach is now explained in an U.S. DoD best practice document and also included in The Aerospace Corporation's specification and standard list. It has also been adopted as a compliance document in some major U.S. space programs, such as GPS Block III, and national security space programs. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Currents induced in: 1) a 100 mx30 in buried rectangular loop conductor (counterpoise) and 2) a grounded vertical conductor of 7-m height by natural and rocket-triggered lightning at distances ranging from 60 to 300 in were recorded in 2005 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT). The peak values of 12 triggered lightning channel-base currents and the peak values of the induced currents in the counterpoise are strongly correlated. The first few microseconds of the current induced in the vertical conductor by triggered lightning return strokes 100 in away resemble electric field time-derivative waveforms simultaneously measured at the ICLRT. During a close natural lightning flash, five pre-first-return-stroke current pulses with peak currents up to 140 A were measured in the vertical conductor. These are apparently associated with multiple attempts of an upward-moving unconnected leader occurring in response to the charge lowered by downward-propagating leader steps.

AB Comparison of rocket motor systems is important when generating data to be used in making design decisions. In order to present meaningful comparisons, non-dimensional numbers related to performance are beneficial, as they remove effects of scale. Traditionally thrust coefficients and C* have been used to quantify the aerodynamic and chemical performance of a system respectively. However, it is argued here that in fact the thrust coefficient does not fully account for aerodynamic performance, as the impact of non-uniform flow at the throat is not accounted for. This discharge coefficient is usually allocated to the chemical efficiency through a correction to C*. However, this causes a coupling between chemical and aerodynamic efficiencies which may lead to poor design decisions. Through the use of a specific impulse coefficient, this risk is avoided, and furthermore comparison of unconventional nozzles becomes more straightforward. It is admitted, however, that this has no actual impact on real motor performance, being more in the way of a tidier 'accounting' system.

ID ROCKET ENGINE; INSTABILITIES; DYNAMICS
AB In a rocket combustor, purely acoustic tuning of gas-liquid scheme injector is studied numerically for acoustic absorption by adopting linear acoustic analysis. Acoustic behavior in the combustor with a single injector is investigated to assure the optimum injector length. Acoustic-absorption effect of the injector is evaluated for cold condition by the quantitative parameter of damping factor as a function of injector length in the chamber for several boundary absorption coefficients. Irrespective of boundary absorption at the chamber wall, it is assured that the optimum tuning-length of the injector corresponds to half of a full wavelength of the first longitudinal overtone mode traveling in the injector with the acoustic frequency intended for damping in the chamber. Although boundary absorption affects little the tuning length of the injector, it appreciably affects damping capacity. Acoustic absorption at the wall increases with boundary absorption coefficient, but purely acoustic-damping effect induced by the tuned injector decreases with the coefficient. As another design parameter, effects of blockage at the injector inlet on acoustic tuning are investigated. It is found that the optimum injector length is shifted depending on the blockage ratio. Suitable combination of injector length and blockage should be made for maximum damping.

AB In the present paper, an adaptive control approach for a flexible launch vehicle is proposed. This approach makes use of gain scheduling and model reference adaptive filter methods to control the flexible behaviours of the launch vehicle structure, which can lead to control system stability degradation. Applying this adaptive controller to an eight-degrees-of-freedom flexible launch vehicle, gives stable and desired responses. Because the designed adaptive controller adjusts only one single parameter and is designed based on the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) rule, it is simpler and faster than the other approaches. Therefore, this newly designed algorithm is less central processing unit-intensive, which makes it easier to implement in real-time applications.

DE launch vehicle; fuel slosh; LQG controller design
AB The suppression of liquid fuel slosh motion is critical in a launch vehicle (LV). In particular, during certain stages of the launch, the dynamics of the fuel interacts adversely with the rigid body dynamics of the LV and the feedback controller must attentuate these effects. This paper describes the effort of a multi-variable control approach applied to the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during a certain stage of its launch. The fuel slosh dynamics are modelled using a pendulum model analogy. We describe two design methodologies using the Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique. The novelty of the technique is that we apply the LQG design for models that are reduced in order through inspection alone. This is possible from a perspective that the LV could be viewed as many small systems attached to a main body and the interactions of some of these smaller systems could be neglected at the controller design stage provided sufficient robustness is ensured by the controller. The first LQG design is carried out without the actuator dynamics incorporated at the design stage and for the second design we neglect the slosh dynamics as well.

AB Composite propellants are now being processed using twin screw extrusion (TSE) to enhance process safety, reduce production costs, minimize lot-to-lot variation, and in some cases, enhance performance. The process is a complex system consisting of multiple ingredient streams feeding into a continuous mixer with an output through an extrusion die producing a structure that is cut into 30-in. lengths of solid composite propellant. By exploiting transient effects of ingredient feeding rate changes during processing, the TSE can be used to easily process composite propellants over wide composition ranges to vary properties for creating rocket motor grains with compositional gradients or to develop new formulations through a combinatorial approach. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a systematic approach for quantifying ingredient and processing effects in TSE on composite propellants processed in a steady-state to serve as a baseline for comparison with composite propellants processed in a transient-state. Such an approach is described using a reduced-run mixture-process experiment design based on the KCV algorithm to minimize the number of samples required for testing over a wide composition range. A corresponding response surface analysis of the results from these experiments indicates a significant dependence of burning rate on both ingredients and processing conditions.

TI Design for robustness using the mu-synthesis applied to launcher
   attitude and vibration control
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The M-V launch vehicle of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has successfully injected Japan's fifth X-ray space telescope "SUZAKU" into its low earth orbit in this past July. The attitude and vibration control algorithm of the M-V rocket used to be highlighted by its H-infinity robust stability since its first flight conducted in 1997. Beyond this, its robustness character has been further enhanced using the mu-synthesis approach to get better robust characteristics not only in stability but in tracking performance under uncertainty of the system dynamics. The performance has been validated by the latest back-to-back successful flights of the vehicle: in May 2003 to directly inject Japan's first asteroid sample return spaceship "HAYABUSA" into the planned inter-planetary trajectory and in this past July to launch the telescope. The mu-synthesis has been applied for the first time ever for Japan's launcher control beyond the reliable H-infinity design. The plant dynamics has an extremely high-order and unstable characteristics, thus the standard mu-synthesis format cannot be directly applied. The paper gives a unique methodology to apply the theory to such a real high-order complicated system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Experimental investigation of high-frequency combustion instabilities in
   liquid rocket engine
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB High-frequency instabilities in liquid propellant rocket engines are experimentally investigated in a model scale research facility. Liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are injected in the combustion chamber at 0.9 MPa through three coaxial injectors vertically aligned. High-amplitude transverse pressure fluctuations are generated in the chamber at frequencies above 1 kHz by a rotating toothed wheel actuator which periodically blocks an auxiliary lateral nozzle. The chamber eigenmodes are identified in a first stage by examining the response of the system to a linear frequency sweep. In a second stage the chamber is excited at the frequency corresponding to the first transverse (1T) mode. The effect of the pressure mode on combustion is observed with intensified and high-speed cameras. Photo-multipliers and pressure sensors are also used to characterize the system behavior and examine phase relations between the corresponding signals. Flame structure modifications observed for specific injection conditions correspond to a strong coupling between acoustics and combustion which notably modifies the flow dynamics, augments the flame expansion rate and enhances heat transfer to the wall.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to use a new design approach based on a Lagrange mean value theorem for the stabilization of multivariable input-delayed system by linear controller.
   Design/methodology/approach - The delay-dependent asymptotical stability conditions are derived by using augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and formulated in terms of conventional Lyapunov matrix equations and some simple matrix inequalities. Proposed design approach is extended to robust stabilization of multi-variable input-delayed systems with unmatched parameter uncertainties. The maximum upper bound of delay size is computed by using a simple optimization algorithm.
   Findings - A liquid monopropellant rocket motor with a pressure feeding system is considered as a numerical design example. Design example shows the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed approach can be used in the analysis and design of the uncertain multivariable time-delay systems.
   Originality/value - The paper has a great potential in the stability analysis of time-delay systems and design of time-delay controllers and may openup a new direction in this area.

DT Article
DE Air safety; Passenger aircraft; Major accidents; Emergency measures
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to suggest and research a method for passenger life-saving in a badly damaged aircraft scenario.
   Design/methodology/approach - The small parachute, brake rocket and inflatable pillow are used for research and design. Theory of braking is offered, researched, developed and the brake possibilities are computed.
   Findings - It is shown here that previous works which have proposed using only parachutes are useless because these failed to consider the likely overload of the parachute jerk stress (at the moment of parachute release) and the impact of aircraft on the Earth's surface. These jerks and impacts destroy aircraft and kill passengers.
   Research limitations/implications - This method is limited by an additional weight of the brake system.
   Practical implications - Offered is a new method for saving passenger lives in any catastrophic situation, including total failure of aircraft control, extreme damage and loss aircraft wings, tail, breakdown all propelling engines, etc.
   Originality/value - Offered is a connected series of related technical innovations which overcome obvious difficulties and allow for a soft, near zero speed landing in any topographically suitable place, allowing potential to save aircraft. This method may be applied to all existing airplanes and increases their weight only about 1.5/2.5 per cent. Also, the method may be used for vertically landing the already built aircraft, for example, when any runway is damaged or would become overloaded.

AB We present summer Na-densities and atmospheric temperatures measured 80 to 110 km above the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR). The Weber Na Lidar is part of ALOMAR, located at 69 degrees N in Norway, 150 km north of the Arctic Circle. The sun does not set here during the summer months, and measurements require a narrowband Faraday Anomalous Dispersion Optical Filter (FADOF).
   We discuss an observed sudden enhancement in the Na number density around 22:00 UT on 1 to 2 June 2006. We compare this observation with previous summer measurements and find a frequent appearance of Na number density enhancements near local midnight. We describe the time of appearance, the altitude distribution, the duration and the strength of these enhancements and compare them to winter observations. We investigate possible formation mechanisms and, as others before, we find a strong link between these Na number density enhancements and sporadic E layers.

AB A hydrogen gas chiller was designed and fabricated in order to simulate the hydrogen temperature ramping test for liquid rocket engines in a single-element gaseous hydrogen/liquid oxygen combustion chamber. Hot fire PDPA measurements of droplet sizes and velocities as a function of the gaseous hydrogen temperature for a fixed mass flow and shear coaxial injector configuration were obtained as the hydrogen temperature was varied from 130 to 290 K, resulting in a doubling of the hydrogen/oxygen velocity and momentum flux ratios. Measured droplet Sauter and arithmetic mean diameters decreased as the hydrogen temperature increased. However, even though the hydrogen temperature change resulted in a doubling of the velocity and momentum flux ratios, the droplet Sauter mean diameter only decreased by 12.5%. These results indicate that the increase in droplet size as the injected hydrogen temperature is decreased may not be a significant contributor to the resulting combustion instability for liquid rocket engines operating at the conditions examined in this study.

ID LINEAR INDUCTION-MOTORS
AB Motivated by reducing the cost of launching space vehicles, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration sponsored an industry /university research project to explore the application of electromagnetic forces. Here, the technical issues involved are examined, the initial achievements reported and further improvements suggested. If the initial launch phase of a space vehicle is horizontal instead of vertical, it is possible to use electromagnetic forces to supplement the rocket thrust, with consequent saving of rocket fuel. The short time of the horizontal launch phase (10-20 s) enables induction levitation to be used in combination with a compact form of a linear induction motor. The performance, dynamic characteristics and scaling laws of this system are examined. Induction levitation is simple and effective, but it has an oscillatory response to force or torque disturbances, and it is unsuitable for very large space vehicles. These problems can be overcome with magnetic suspension using controlled DC electromagnets. Although the energy required for electromagnetic launch assistance is small, the electrical power demand is very high, necessitating some form of local energy storage.

AB A soilless culture system (SCS) can improve the quality of raw material at harvest and enhance post-harvest shelf-life in many fresh-cut vegetables. Fresh-cut produce has been targeted to satisfy the increasing demand for convenience products for modern society. Recently, there has been growing interest to introduce garden cress into the fresh-cut supply chain. A standardised growing system is required to obtain suitable fresh-cut raw material in terms of marketable stage, low nitrate content, and long shelf-life. Four experiments were carried out to investigate a floating SCS and post-harvest management to produce marketable garden cress and to preserve its freshness during shelf-life. Various total N levels (6, 8, 12, or 16 mM), NO3--N:NH4(+)-N ratios (25:75, 50:50, 75:25, or 40:60) in the growing nutrient solution, storage temperatures (4 degrees C, 8 degrees C, or 16 degrees C), and five polypropylene (PP) films used during shelf-life, were tested. The research showed that garden cress is suitable for production in a SCS and that this technique leads to greater commercial production than soil culture, reaching > 600 g m(-2) in 14 d, and > 4,700 g m(-2) in 34 d. Total N at 12 mM was too high to obtain leaves with an acceptable nitrate content (< 2,500 mg kg(-1) FW). Polypropylene film and storage temperature significantly influenced the loss of FW during shelf-life; however, this loss was always below 2%. The optimal storage temperature to maintain freshness was 4 degrees C, while the five PP films tested showed inconsistent results.

AB This paper presents a partially reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle concept for delivering 65 metric ton payloads to low Earth orbit. A winged booster and an expendable core stage each use identical main propulsion, thrust structure, and propellant feed systems. For both stages, four 745,000 lbf thrust, RS-68 oxygen/hydrogen rocket engines, presently used on the Delta-IV launch vehicle, are used. The booster, which does not require reentry thermal protection, ascends to a Mach 2.4,81,000 ft altitude condition, separates from the core stage, and glides back to a runway landing. Sixty-five metric tons in orbit would be enabling to a variety of exploration missions, including very large telescope emplacement missions, robust outer planet missions, and others requiring large payload masses or volumes. Use of a reusable booster, designed for maintainability and affordability, would, in combination with an expendable core using common propulsion, allow for significant reductions in recurring costs compared with a totally expendable vehicle with similar payload capabilities.

AB Lightning research needs on-demand lightning strikes, because of the random character of natural lightning. Lasers have been proposed as alternatives to the current technique using rocket-pulled wires, because they would expectedly provide more flexibility. However, high-energy, nanosecond lasers cannot provide long connected plasma channels. In contrast, we recently reported the triggering of electric events in thunderclouds using ultrashort laser pulses. Further improvements of the laser pulse sequence and experimental geometry are discussed. [DOI: 10.2971/jeos.2008.08035]

TI Prediction of elastic properties of thermo structural composites with
   multidirectional reinforcement.
SO MATERIA-RIO DE JANEIRO

DE Thermo structural composites; Carbon/carbon composites; Elastic
   properties; Orthotropic materials micromechanics
AB Composites are a class of materials which have superlative properties in relation to the isotropic materials (metals, ceramics and polymers) if one can look to a combination of high resistance and low weight. The reinforcement fibers, the matrix and the interface between them define the performance and the maximum temperature of the component in service. Composites designed to work under temperatures higher than 1000 degrees C are called thermo-structural composites. Because of their high thermal shock resistance, these materials are used in critical applications such as kick motor nozzles, thermal protections for re-entry ablative and reradiative systems and aircraft brakes. They are usually made by using preforms, that are assembled rods forming a "skeleton" that translates rigidity and strength to the material. The use of preform technology allows an enormous variety of complex geometries and dimensions, which consequently allows flexibility in the design of the component. Although presenting incontestable advantages, the cost of these materials is still prohibitive to common industrial applications. The mechanical tests costs to validate the properties are also high and special equipments are necessary to make them practical. The present work describes the analytical methods to predict elastic properties of thermo structural composites known as Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites (CFRC) having tri directional (3D) and tetra directional (4D) architectures, in order to make an valuable analysis of their results. Properties were calculated at ambient temperature, and comparisons were made with the properties of graphites formerly used as a standard material for kick rocket motor nozzles. The predictions of elastic properties were based on the homogenization method, considering the hypothesis of straight fiber bundles, resulting in ponderal average elastic properties.

AB This article explores the impact of the professional culture of rocket engineering in Stalin's Soviet Union on the engineering and organizational practices of the space program during the Khrushchev era. The Stalinist legacy and the dual military/civilian character of rocket engineers' work profoundly affected the identity of this elite part of Soviet technical intelligentsia. Focusing on such notions as control, authority, and responsibility, this article examines the role of engineering culture in shaping the Soviet approach to the automation of piloted spacecraft control. Through patronage and networking, rocket engineers were able to overcome the inefficiency of Soviet industrial management and to advance their agenda of space exploration.

AB There has been a rapid increase in the complexity and integration of many safety-critical systems. In consequence, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify the causes of incidents and accidents back through the complex interactions that lead to an adverse event. At the same time, there is a growing appreciation of the need to consider a broad range of contextual factors in the aftermath of any mishap. A number of regulators, operators and research teams have responded to these developments by proposing novel techniques to support the analysis of complex, safety-critical incidents. It is important to illustrate these different approaches by applying them to a number of common case studies. The following pages, therefore, show how STAMP and AcciMap might support the Servigo Publico Federal investigation into the explosion and fire of the Brazilian launch vehicle VLS-1 V03.

DE Eruca sativa; Diplotaxis tenuifolia; hydroponic system; cultivar;
   mineral nutrition
ID NITRATE
AB Empiricism in the use of nutrient solutions is frequent. Several times the same nutrient solution is used to grow different species based only on morphological similarities. This practice may lead to nutritional imbalances, affecting not only the production but also the quality of the product due to an accumulation of nitrate. An experiment under hydroponic conditions - the NFT system - was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effect of the concentration of nitrogen in the nutrient solution on the production and on the nutrient and nitrate contents of rocket (Eruca sativa) salad leaves. The experiment was carried out in spring 2003, in a randomized block design and in a 4 x 3 factorial design, with four replicates. Four nitrogen concentrations in the nutrient solution (60.8; 121.6; 182.5; 243.5 mg L(-1)) and three rocket salad cultivars (Cultivada, Folha Larga and Selvatica) were evaluated. Cv. Cultivada produced the tallest plants and the highest leaf fresh fitomass, not differing from cv. 'Folha Larga' in the number of leaves, leaf nitrate content, root dry fitomass and root fresh fitomass. An increment in NO(3)(-), N, Ca and P and a reduction in Mg, K and S occurred when the concentration of N in the nutrient solution was increased. Cultivation of cv. Cultivada at the concentration of 93 mg L(-1) is the most recommended as it provides the highest yield and low nitrate content.

AB Space research in India began in the early sixties, with the establishment of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station. Indigenously developed rocket payloads were carried in foreign rockets and flown for studying various atmospheric parameters, which are unique to the tropics. In the seventies, Indian-made rockets became available. Since then, there has been rapid progress in the technical advancement, which helped the atmospheric scientists in taking up more challenging and contemporary problems, related to mesospheric winds, ionospheric irregularities, stratospheric ozone, role of aerosols in atmospheric radiative transfer, etc. India entered into the satellite era in 1975, with the development of the Aryabhatta satellite, the first Indian experimental satellite, followed by Bhaskara-1 in 1979, which carried a microwave radio meter for retrieval of atmospheric water vapour and cloud liquid water contents. Since then, there have been several satellites, such as the INSAT series for meteorology and communication, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite series, and Stretched Rohini Satellite System (SROSS) for in situ observation of the ionosphere, which are all built in India and launched from Indian soil. High quality data being obtained from these satellite missions are helping scientists in taking up problems that are of regional and global scales and in studying the changes that are taking place in the earth atmosphere system, in a more holistic way. This paper attempts to provide an overview of the scientific developments and highlights some results.

AB Indian Space Research Organization successfully carried out more than 40 space missions, during the last four decades, in the area of space sciences, spacecraft technologies, space applications and launch vehicle technologies. Mission planning and mission design are the most important multi-disciplinary elements in realizing these objectives. The present article describes the methodology followed in mission planning and mission design for different types of space missions of ISRO, bringing out the trade-off and inter-disciplinary nature of these activities. Important aspects of mission planning in the lift-off phase, the atmospheric and exoatmospheric phases of a launch vehicle are described. A number of conflicting mission constraints have to be addressed in designing an optimal and robust mission profile for the launch. In addition to reducing aerodynamic and structural loads, considerations related to flight safety and ground station visibility are important parameters. Special launch considerations are to be addressed in designing trajectories for lunar or planetary missions. Launch phase would extend up to injection of the spacecraft in the desired orbit. Thereupon, the spacecraft mission operations are divided into initial phase and operational phase. Initial orbital phase operations include, orbit raising and acquisition operations, and testing of the payloads. The operational phase of spacecraft mission covers, satellite health monitoring and maintenance, station keeping, special operations on the spacecraft, trend analysis and any contingency operations, all leading to gainful utilization of the satellite. A number of mission operations also have now become imperative for mitigating the detrimental effects of ever increasing space debris.

DT Article
AB The paper concerns possible concept variants of a partially reusable Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicle derived from the advanced basic launcher (Ariane-2010) by means of substitution of the EAP Solid Rocket Boosters for a Reusable Starting Stage consisting two Liquid-propellant Reusable Fly-Back Boosters called "Bargouzin". This paper describes the status of the presently studied RFBB concepts during its three phases. The first project phase was dedicated to feasibility expertise of liquid-rocket reusable fly-back boosters ("Baikal" type) utilization for heavy-lift space launch vehicle. The design features and main conclusions are presented. The second phase has been performed with the purpose of selection of preferable concept among the alternative ones for the future Ariane LV modernization by using RFBB instead of EAP Boosters. The main requirements, logic of work, possible configuration and conclusion are presented. Initial aerodynamic, ballistic, thermoloading, dynamic loading, trade-off and comparison analysis have been performed on these concepts. The third phase consists in performing a more detailed expertise of the chosen LV concept. This part summarizes some of the more detailed results related to flight performance, system mass, thermoprotection system, aspects of technologies, ground complex modification, comparison analyses and conclusion.

AB The history of the life of V.I. Voznyuk is a history of the phenomenon of the Soviet rocket progress when the engineers with experience of launch of military rocket of small radius of action were testing the ballistic missiles. The remarkable and little-known destiny of Voznuk is the history of the Soviet rocket technology experts who had a severe practical schooling of command by the military forces of the first combat missiles "Katucha" during the grim military years (including the grandiose fight in Stalingrad) and then they have continued to launch the ballistic missiles. VI. Voznyuk worked as the chief of the first Soviet cosmodrome Kapustin Yar for almost 30 years-since the most difficult moment of its organization. He organized a launch of the first Soviet ballistic missiles R-1, R-2, R-5M of S. Korolev. This report is about the outstanding achievement of the organizing ability of V.I. Voznyuk-about the launch of a missile with a nuclear warhead in 1956. V.I. Voznyuk closes a unique chain in the world of outstanding figures of space-rocket technology who were born or lived in Ukraine from designers of missile up to the organizers of its manufacture and now up to the organizers of the tests of rockets-J.

AB Trial of hands-on education of rocket technology for university students using water rocket, which consists of structural study, propulsion system study, aerodynamic study, stability study, and flight trajectory study, has been performed. Integrating each subject into a group of tasks, a hands-on education system of aerospace technology will become feasible. Advantage of the system is that students can verify the theory by hands-on practice. Development of recovery mechanism for water rocket will be a good subject of hands-on innovative design. Although the system has been developed mostly for university students, it can easily be converted to hands-on education system for school children and high school students. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Direct numerical simulations are conducted for one-dimensional laminar diffusion flames over a large range of pressures (I <= P-0 <= 200 atm) employing a detailed multicomponent transport model applicable to dense fluids. Reaction kinetics mechanisms including pressure dependencies and prior validations at both low and high pressures were selected and include a detailed 24-step, 12-species hydrogen mechanism (H-2/O-2 and 142/air), and reduced mechanisms for methane (CH4/air: 11 steps, 15 species) and heptane (C7H16/air: 13 steps, 17 species), all including thermal NOx chemistry. The governing equations are the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the Peng-Robinson real fluid equation of state. A generalized multicomponent diffusion model derived from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and fluctuation theory is employed and includes both heat and mass transport in the presence of concentration, temperature, and pressure gradients (i.e., Dufour and Soret diffusion). Previously tested high-pressure mixture property models are employed for the viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusivities. Five models for high-pressure thermal diffusion coefficients related to Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion are first compared with experimental data over a wide range of pressures. Laminar flame simulations are then conducted for each of the four flames over a large range of pressures for all thermal diffusion coefficient models and results are compared with purely Fickian and Fourier diffusion simulations. The results reveal a considerable range in the influence of cross-diffusion predicted by the various models; however, the most plausible models show significant cross-diffusion effects, including reductions in the peak flame temperatures and minor species concentrations for all flames. These effects increase with pressure for both H-2 flames and for the C7H16 flames indicating the elevated importance of proper cross-diffusion modeling at large pressures. Cross-diffusion effects, while not negligible, were observed to be less significant in the CH4 flames and to decrease with pressure. Deficiencies in the existing thermal diffusion coefficient models are discussed and future research directions suggested. (c) 2007 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Full characterization of nighttime ionospheric plasma requires access to both the ion and electron thermal core populations. Efforts to measure particle distributions with rocket and satellite detectors designed to study low energy particles are hindered because the magnitude of spacecraft charging is on the order of or greater than the energy of the bulk of ionospheric particles. This paper presents initial laboratory investigations exploring the formation of plasma sheaths with ionospheric electron energies, densities, and Debye lengths. The goal is to identify the difficulties and solutions to obtaining both thermal electron and ion velocity distributions on one payload. Sheaths around a long cylinder biased with respect to the vacuum vessel wall are studied to verify measurement procedures. An experimental setup in which two conducting spheres, with area ratios in excess of 100, are biased with respect to one another and not referenced to the wall simulates a payload-detector system. Data are compared with simple planar, cylindrical, and spherical sheath models. Ion-rich sheaths conformed with expectations. The criterion for the formation of electron-rich sheaths was found not only to depend on the ratio of ion collector area to electron collector area but also the ratio of the collector area to sheath area. Nonmonotonic electron sheaths obtained by embedding a positively biased electrode within the sheath of a more negative conductor are also explored. It was found that the superposition of two different potential geometries led to the formation of the nonmonotonic potential structures. These initial plasma ion and electron sheath investigations both clarify the behavior of a thermal electron detector previously flown in the ionosphere and explore a low energy parameter regime that is understudied in the laboratory.

AB Since the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics issued the first position paper on space debris 25 years ago, recognition of the threats posed by debris in Earth orbit and the need to act now to protect the future space environment have become widespread. This new awareness has been matched with positive actions by spacecraft and launch vehicle designers, manufacturers, and operators. As a result, a common set of space debris mitigation policies and practices has been forming at both the national and international levels.

AB In this paper, the theory based on multi-sensor information fusion is studied, which is used to evaluate the health condition of liquid-propellant rocket engine ground-testing bed. The concept of health degree is defined. It is used as a quantitative index for evaluating the health condition of the ground-testing bed. In order to evaluate the health condition of the ground-testing bed on different levels, health degrees of a single parameter, of a sub-system and of a system are defined. They accordingly measure the health conditions of single parameter, sub-system and system of the ground-testing bed. The method of fuzzy data fusion is used to calculate the health degree. In this method the weight of each monitoring sensor is calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP), then, the multi-sensor data are fused by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, next, the sequence data are fused by two-grade index evaluation method, finally, the health degree is calculated by defuzzification method. Based on these, the health condition evaluation system of ground-testing bed is set up, which can evaluate the health condition of the ground-testing bed properly and quantitatively. At last, the application of the health evaluation system in fault detection and health evaluation of the ground-testing bed are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Launch-vehicle volume and payload geometry often prefer a spacecraft design based on spin stabilization about a minor principal axis, at least for a portion of the spacecraft lifetime. Active stabilization is required to maintain minor-axis spin in the presence of energy dissipation. Lyapunov stability theory is used to develop a globally stable control law using a single reaction wheel mounted transverse to the desired spin axis. This control law provides practical automatic recovery of desired spin from any initial state, which linearized analysis and design methods cannot, including recovery from spin about a major axis (flat spin). A family of control laws is derived that includes linear feedback from a single rate gyro and a wheel tachometer.

AB A combustor model of a rocket-ramjet combined-cycle engine was tested in the ejector-jet mode under a sea-level, still condition. The model had two rockets in the duct. Propellants were gaseous hydrogen and oxygen. Design factors of the combustor were cross sections at the entrance and the exit, length of the combustor, fuel injection position, and rocket operating conditions. In the tests, the designed operation of the ejector jet was successfully attained, that is, breathed air was choked at the throat section. Supersonic rocket exhaust and air were decelerated in the divergent duct with an increase of the wall pressure. Fuel was injected in the downstream straight section and combustion gas choked at the exit. The mean Mach number was unity, and the mean combustion efficiency was 0.8 according to the pilot pressure measurement and gas sampling. Suction performance was increased with an increase of the mixture ratio of the rockets. The pressure level in the model was affected by the length of the upstream straight section. The combustion status was not affected by the length of the downstream straight section or the position of fuel injection. An increase of fuel caused an increase of the pressure until attainment of a stoicheometric condition.

AB The response of plain-orifice injectors to finite amplitude nonacoustic pressure pulsations within the downstream chamber was addressed with a series of unsteady axisymmetric Navier-Stokes calculations. Linear theories are reviewed and it is shown that results can be collapsed to a single curve when characterizing the response in terms of a frequency related to the fluid transit time within the orifice passage. Computational results were obtained for a wide range of frequencies, perturbation amplitudes, flow conditions, and orifice designs to quantify the effects of nonlinear fluid mechanics. In general, the simulations all show an unforced response (or self-pulsation) due to instabilities of the vena contracta region lying downstream of the inlet lip. For conditions pertinent to rocket injectors, the nonlinear response is generally bounded by the linear theory (except at high frequencies, in which self-pulsations not accounted for in linear theory remain present). Although a local resonance condition exists when the driving frequency is near the natural/unforced oscillation frequency of the injector, the overall response in this region is still bounded by the linear theory. The effects of orifice rounding and orifice length are also studied parametrically.

AB The objective of this work is to study the nozzle erosion rates at a broad range of pressures from 7 to 55 MPa with two baseline propellants: one is a nonmetallized propellant and the other is a metallized propellant, called propellants S and M, respectively. A comprehensive model for graphite nozzle erosion minimization and a numerical code has been advanced to predict the nozzle throat recession rates at high pressures. Four different kinetic schemes for heterogeneous graphite oxidation reactions were compared. The recession rate was found to increase almost linearly with pressure. The magnitudes of recession rates depend on the chemical kinetic scheme and the propellant composition. Contrary to popular belief, at lower pressures (P < 14 MPa), the heterogeneous kinetic rates showed a pronounced effect on the erosion rates, though at higher pressures, the nozzle throat erosion is mainly diffusion controlled. This observation stresses the importance of more accurate and definitive kinetic parameters for graphite oxidation reactions, especially at lower pressures. It was also observed that, besides H2O, the OH species affects the nozzle recession rate greatly. For the metallized propellant, the concentrations of major oxidizing species such as H2O, OH, and CO2 are substantially reduced in comparison with the nonmetallized propellant, resulting in significant reduction of the erosion rates. A comparison of experimental data and predicted results from the graphite nozzle erosion minimization code shows excellent agreement especially for the nonmetallized propellant. To substantially reduce the throat recession rates at high pressures, it is suggested that the boundary-layer control at the throat region could be an effective method for future nozzle design considerations.

AB The introduction of inorganic nanomaterials as additives into polymer systems has resulted in polymer nanostructured materials exhibiting a multiplicity of high-performance characteristics beyond what traditional polymer composites possess. These multifunctional features attributable to polymer nanocomposites consist of improved thermal and flame resistance, moisture and chemical resistance, decreased permeability, charge dissipation, and thermal/electricity conductivity. Through control/alteration of the additive at the nanoscale level, one is able to maximize property enhancement of selected polymer systems to meet or exceed the requirements of current commercial, military, and aerospace applications. The technical approach involves the introduction of nanoparticles into selected polymer matrix systems whereby nanoparticles may be surface-treated to provide hydrophobic characteristics and enhanced inclusion into the hydrophobic polymer matrix. The objectives of this paper are to summarize our current research efforts in the use of polymer nanostructured materials for high-temperature applications such as rocket nozzle ablative materials, resulting in lower ablation rates and reduced backside temperatures, carbon-carbon composites with improved thermo-oxidative resistance, and enhanced damage-tolerant high-performance epoxy matrix resin, but not carried over to carbon-fiber-reinforced composite systems.

AB An archival paper is presented on the development and production by the Reaction Motors Division of Thiokol Chemical Corporation of the LR44-RM-4, LR58-RM-4, and LR62-RM-2 packaged liquid rocket engines. These factory-filled units were the only significant use by the United States of liquid propellant technology for airborne tactical missiles. The LR58 and LR62 were in worldwide use by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force in the 1960s and 1970s, with some 50,000 having been produced. Total program costs in 1965 dollars were $120 million. These robust units were used without restrictions on flight-carrying cycles, catapult launchings, or carrier landings, with a recorded functional reliability of the LR58 at 90% confidence level of 0.9978. Commencing with early work in 1957 a review is made of the sequential programs and the technical and operational hurdles overcome in such novel designs. Brief insights are provided into the events that prevented further development of the family.

AB Based on the author's recent study on detailed modeling of the atomization characteristics of a liquid/gas phase coaxial injector, an improved computation model for predicting the combustion performance of a LOX/hydrogen engine is proposed. The features of this model are that it allows calculation of the local rate of atomization of the LOX jet and deals with droplet size distribution of the LOX spray. Additionally the model applies the burning rate constant of LOX/hydrogen combustion derived by the author's former experiment. Using this model, evaluations of the design criteria for the LE-5 engine, which was equipped on the H-2 launcher, and its derivative engines, which have been used with the H-2A launcher, were conducted. Furthermore, optimization of the derivative engine's injector design to improve combustion stability and combustion performance was discussed.

AB The yield of sugar beet and rocket was evaluated, as a result of planting times in sole crop and intercropping system. The experiment was carried out in Mossoro, from January to March,f 2005. The experimental design was of randomized complete blocks with nine treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of the intercrops of sugar beet with rocket established at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days after sugar beet sowing date, as well as of sugar beet and rocket cultivated as sole crops, planted at the same times of the intercropping establishment. The highest values of fresh shoot (50.19 g/plant), dry mass (5.86 g/plant) and yield (1338.47 g/m(2)) of rocket were observed in the intercropping systems established at the same time. The highest values of shoot fresh mass and root yield of sugar beet were observed in sole crop. The highest land equivalent ratios were obtained in the intercropping systems where the rocket was sown at the same time of sugar beet and 7 days after sugar beet crop.

AB The interaction of rocket-triggered lightning with two unenergized power distribution lines of about 800 in length was studied at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Florida. A horizontally configured line was tested. in 2000, and a vertically configured line in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The horizontally and vertically configured lines were equipped with six and four arrester stations, respectively, and, additionally, in 2003, the vertical line with a pole-mounted transformer. During the 2000, 2001, and 2002 experiments, arresters were frequently rendered inoperable by disconnector operation during triggered lightning strokes, but there was no disconnector operation during the 2003 experiment when the transformer was on the line. In all four years, there were commonly flashovers from the struck phase-conductor to the closest phase-conductor not subjected to direct lightning current injection. The self-consistency of measurements is assessed via comparison of the injected lightning current with: 1) the total current flowing to Earth through the multiple line groundings and 2) the total phase-to-neutral current flowing through the line arresters and line terminations. This paper is part one of two related papers.

AB The aim of this paper is to propose a new fracture criterion of rubber-like materials under plane stress loading. Our experimental data already published [A. Hamdi, M. Nait Abdelaziz, N. Ait Hocine, P. Heuillet, N. Benseddiq, Fracture criteria of rubber like-materials under plane stress conditions. Polym. Test. 25(9) (2006) 994-1005] are herein completed by results obtained from pure shear tests and then further analysed. In this analysis, we used a theoretical approach based on a reference axis change principle, introduced earlier by Neviere et al. [A strain based design criterion for solid propellant rocket motors. Proceedings OTAN, Symposium on Combat Survivability of Air, Sea and Land Vehicles, Alborg, Denmark, 2002, pp. 23-26] for the case of solid propellant materials. Logarithmic extensions evaluated in a specific coordinates system were introduced in the analytical development, which leads to identifying a relevant rubber fracture criterion. The ultimate experimental extensions were compared with the predictions of this criterion and good agreement was observed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Venus; human exploration; flybys; patched conics
AB This paper investigates near-term, low-cost human expeditions to Venus using gravity assisted trajectories and telepresence. In this mission design, a crewed spacecraft is injected onto a near minimum-energy transfer to Venus, and upon arrival is targeted to perform a polar flyby manoeuvre which transforms its outbound trajectory into a heliocentric orbit that maintains close proximity to the planet for an extended period of time. From this vantage point, astronauts can utilize real-time surface communications to remotely operate a series of robotic Venusian explorers. At the conclusion of the mission, a second polar flyby is used to re-inject the spacecraft onto its original trajectory, which returns the crewed vehicle to Earth exactly two years after launch. Employing such gravity-assisted trajectories, an entire round-trip piloted flight to Venus can be accomplished using a single low-energy injection burn leaving Earth, with only minute (<1500 m/s velocity change) adjustments required subsequently. The proposed mission design can be accomplished with either dedicated spacecraft and Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV)-class boosters, or alternatively, with combinations of spacecraft and launch systems planned for NASA's current exploration systems architecture. It is concluded that the mission design proposed herein represents a simple, safe, and cost-effective method of exploring one of the most compelling worlds in our solar system, while simultaneously allowing humankind to extend its reach further into space.

AB A single injector element liquid rocket combustion experiment was designed and conducted to investigate the combustion dynamics of a gas-centered, liquid-swirled coaxial injector element. The oxidizer was a mixture of superheated water and oxygen, and kerosene was used as the fuel. The mean chamber pressure ranged from 2.14 to 2.38 MPa. The combustion chamber length was discretely varied between 25.4 and 88.9 cm to determine the dependence of combustion stability characteristics on resonant frequency and mode shape. Strong spontaneous instabilities were measured with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.69 to 1.38 MPa, and wave slopes on the order of 1000 MPa/s. The frequencies of the strongest instabilities ranged from 1184 to 1721 Hz. The most amplified modes ranged from the first longitudinal for the 38.1-cm chamber to the third longitudinal for the 88.9-em chamber. One test, with a 25.4-cm chamber, was classically stable with pressure oscillation amplitudes less than 5% of the mean pressure. Resonant frequencies calculated with a model of the chamber acoustics compared well with measured values. For this injector, the data suggest that the observed stability behavior is a result of the combined effects of chamber mode shape and a driving combustion mechanism that limits the frequency range over which instability occurs.

AB An evaluation of the current state of the commercial space sector in conjunction with the ever-increasing presence of micro- and minisatellites in the telecommunication market stresses the requirement to establish an economically feasible launch capability for relatively small satellites. The aim of this paper is to present a series of design methodologies that will enable the initial design of dual-propulsion uninhabited aerospace vehicles with horizontal-takeoff-and-landing capabilities, which will fill this niche in the space launch sector. A concept-specific initial sizing methodology is presented with a trajectory design tool that integrates aerodynamic heating with descent trajectory optimization, which together form part of the development of a complete design,methodology embedded in a visually interfaced software program.

TI End-to-end analysis of solar-electric-propulsion earth orbit raising for
   interplanetary missions
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB An end-to-end investigation of solar electric Earth orbit raising for interplanetary missions is discussed. In such mission designs, a solar electric tug is used to elevate an interplanetary payload from an initial low-Earth orbit to a highly eccentric Earth orbit, after which the tug is released and interplanetary injection is performed by a small chemical upper stage. Launching payloads from highly eccentric orbits allows for a dramatic reduction in the velocity change required for interplanetary missions, as contrasted against direct injection from the Earth's surface or low-Earth orbit. Correspondingly, significantly higher payload mass fractions can be achieved using solar electric Earth-orbit-raising mission designs. However, although highly promising as a potential means of dispatching interplanetary payloads, a number of key factors are identified that can severely limit such potential. In particular, propellant boil-off in the chemical upper stage during orbit raising can lead to payload-optimal specific impulse values in many cases. Additional considerations such as the desirability of solar electric tug reuse can further contribute to marginalize the benefits of solar electric Earth orbit raising with respect to competing propulsion options. This study investigates key issues associated with solar electric Earth-orbit-raising missions, including circumstances leading to payload-optimal specific impulse values, payload-optimal inclinations for orbit raising, and achievable relative payload gain rates for solar electric Earth-orbit-raising missions compared with all-chemical injection scenarios. A new variation of the low-thrust rocket equation is derived for interplanetary missions. Finally, a novel form of orbital transfer, referred to as an Earth-eclipse-evading transfer, is also introduced, which can potentially increase achievable solar electric Earth-orbit-raising payload ratios and rates when higher-inclination orbits are accessible. It is concluded that solar electric Earth orbit raising represents a promising way of undertaking interplanetary missions, but that constraints nevertheless exist that can powerfully reduce the effectiveness of such mission designs.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Multidisciplinary design optimization of solid-fueled multistage space launch vehicles requires complex high-dimensional simulation models. To improve on the ability to efficiently explore and approximate large subspaces of these models, this research develops a new set of experimental designs for metamodeling with support vector regression. We propose to Latinize and improve the orthogonality of Hammersley sequence sampling for creating nearly orthogonal and excellent space-filling designs. Multiple measures are used to assess the quality of designed experiments. The designs are used to create metamodels of trajectory simulation of space launch vehicles using support vector regression. A hybrid genetic algorithm uses metamodels to identify minimum-launch-weight space launch vehicles. This approach resulted in an overall rapid and efficient design optimization scheme.

ID LAUNCH VEHICLE ACOUSTICS
AB Interior fairing noise is an important consideration for payload launch survivability and has been studied extensively since the beginning of the space program. This work presents acoustic transmission studies conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, on a composite, grid-stiffened, Minotaur payload fairing. These tests were performed in an acoustics laboratory and examined the effects of acoustic flanking paths, the thermal protection system, and melamine-type acoustic blanket treatments on fairing noise. The data showed that acoustic flanking paths significantly increase noise transmission, especially at low frequency. The bare fairing with thermal protection system provided approximately 14 dB of noise reduction over the 5000 Hz bandwidth relative to external levels. Acoustic blanket performance was measured as a function of bandwidth, surface area coverage, and mass. It was observed that small amounts of treatment (2 kg) significantly increased noise reduction (3.6 dB), even at low frequency.

AB High-amplitude pressure oscillations in solid propellant rocket motor combustion chambers display nonlinear effects including: (1) limit cycle behavior in which the fluctuations may dwell for a considerable period of time near their peak amplitude, (2) elevated mean chamber pressure (DC shift), and (3) a triggering amplitude above which pulsing will cause an apparently stable system to transition to violent oscillations. Along with the obvious undesirable vibrations, these features constitute the most damaging impact of combustion instability on system reliability and structural integrity. The physical mechanisms behind these phenomena and their relationship to motor geometry and physical parameters must, therefore, be fully understood if instability is to be avoided in the design process, or if effective corrective measures must be devised during system development. Predictive algorithms now in use have limited ability to characterize the actual time evolution of the oscillations, and they do not supply the motor designer with information regarding peak amplitudes or the associated critical triggering amplitudes. A pivotal missing element is the ability to predict the mean pressure shift; clearly, the designer requires information regarding the maximum chamber pressure that might be experienced during motor operation. In this paper, a comprehensive nonlinear combustion instability model is described that supplies vital information. The central role played by steep-fronted waves is emphasized. The resulting algorithm provides both detailed physical models of nonlinear instability phenomena and the critically needed predictive capability. In particular, the origin of the DC shift is revealed. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

DE Falcon 1; launch vehicle; low cost launch
AB Falcon 1 was launched on March 25, 2006 from Omelek, a small island which is part of the Kwajalein Atoll of the Marshall Islands. Though the vehicle lifted off with a first stage engine fire, for the first 30 seconds the vehicle performed nominally. At T=+30 seconds, the main engine shut down. The vehicle landed 150 m downrange from the launch pad. Three days prior to the launch, a system test was conducted which included a static firing of the first stage engine to verify vehicle and pad operation, vehicle fueling and de-tanking, as well as exercising the interfaces to the Range, such as telemetry links, video and flight safety. This test was successful with no anomalies. The customer for this flight was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the USAF under the joint USAF and DARPA Falcon Program. The objectives of the flight were to demonstrate responsive operations including rapid payload integration and collect data on the both the vehicle and the operations.

AB The Vision for Space Exploration identified the exploration of Mars as one of the key pathways. In response, NASA's Mars Program Office is developing a detailed mission lineup for the next decade that would lead to future explorations. Mission architectures for the next decade include both orbiters and landers. Existing power technologies, which could include solar panels, batteries, radioisotope power systems, and in the future fission power, could support these missions. Second and third decade explorations could target human precursor and human in-situ missions, building on increasingly complex architectures. Some of these could use potential feed forward from earlier Constellation missions to the Moon, discussed in the ESAS study. From a potential Mars Sample Return mission to human missions the complexity of the architectures increases, and with it the delivered mass and power requirements also amplify. The delivered mass at Mars mostly depends on the launch vehicle, while the landed mass might be further limited by EDL technologies, including the aeroshell, parachutes, landing platform, and pinpoint landing. The resulting in-situ mass could be further divided into payload elements and suitable supporting power systems. These power systems can range from tens of watts to multi-kilowatts, influenced by mission type, mission configuration, landing location, mission duration, and season. Regardless, the power system design should match the power needs of these surface assets within a given architecture. Consequently, in this paper we will identify potential needs and bounds of delivered mass and architecture dependant power requirements to surface assets that would enable future in-situ exploration of Mars.

ID BRIEF-HISTORY; PROPULSION; IMPULSE; TARGET
AB Laser reactive thrust is regarded as a promising approach for creating energy-efficient aerospace transport systems. One fundamental advantage of laser technologies for creating reactive thrust is that there is no spent rocket stage that needs to be jettisoned or returned to earth. The concept of laser thrust is based on the use of the energy of a remote laser source. A feature of the processes for forming laser thrust is that they are "switched on" under the action of intense laser radiation. The main problem in developing modern laser systems for reactive thrust is to make laser thrust energy-efficient and to ensure fuel economy. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB Although the rocket-based x-ray quantum calorimetry (XQC) experiment was designed for x-ray spectroscopy, the minimal shielding of its calorimeters, its low atmospheric overburden, and its low-threshold detectors make it among the most sensitive instruments for detecting or constraining strong interactions between dark matter particles and baryons. We use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the precise limits the XQC experiment places on spin-independent interactions between dark matter and baryons, improving upon earlier analytical estimates. We find that the XQC experiment rules out a wide range of nucleon-scattering cross sections centered around 1 b for dark matter particles with masses between 0.01 and 10(5) GeV. Our analysis also provides new constraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter strongly interacts with baryons.

AB The lightning-induced-damages in the mid-latitude regions are usually caused during severe thunderstorms. But the discharge parameters of natural lightning are difficult to be measured. Five lightning flashes have been artificially triggered with the rocket-wire technique during the passage of two severe thunderstorms. The discharge current and close electric field of return stroke in artificially triggered lightning have been obtained in microsecond time resolution by using current measuring systems and electric field change sensors. The results show that the five triggered lightning flashes include 1 to 10 return strokes, and the average return stroke current is 11.9 kA with a maximum of 21.0 kA and a minimum of 6.6 kA, similar to the subsequent return strokes in natural lightning. The half peak width of the current waveform is 39 mu s, which is much larger than the usual result. The peak current of stroke I (p) (kA) and the neutralized charge Q(C) has a relationship of I (p) = 18.5Q(0.65). The radiation field of return stroke is 5.9 kV center dot m(-1) and 0.39 kV center dot m(-1) at 60 m and 550 m, respectively. The radiation field decreases as r (-1.119) with increase of horizontal distance r from the discharge channel. Based on the well-accepted transmission line model, the speed of return stroke is estimated to be about 1.4x10(8) m center dot s(-1), with a variation range of (1.1-1.6)x10(8) m center dot s(-1). Because of the similarities of the triggered lightning and natural lightning, the results in this article can be used in the protection design of natural lightning.

ID MISSION; MERCURY
AB The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft was designed and constructed to withstand the harsh environments associated with achieving and operating in Mercury orbit. The system can be divided into eight subsystems: structures and mechanisms (e.g., the composite core structure, aluminum launch vehicle adapter, and deployables), propulsion (e.g., the state-of-the-art titanium fuel tanks, thruster modules, and associated plumbing), thermal (e.g., the ceramic-cloth sunshade, heaters, and radiators), power (e.g., solar arrays, battery, and controlling electronics), avionics (e.g., the processors, solid-state recorder, and data handling electronics), software (e.g., processor-supported code that performs commanding, data handling, and spacecraft control), guidance and control (e.g., attitude sensors including star cameras and Sun sensors integrated with controllers including reaction wheels), radio frequency telecommunications (e.g., the spacecraft antenna suites and supporting electronics), and payload (e.g., the science instruments and supporting processors). This system architecture went through an extensive (nearly four-year) development and testing effort that provided the team with confidence that all mission goals will be achieved.

DE Mercury; MESSENGER; mission operations
AB On August 3, 2004, at 2:15 a.m. EST, the MESSENGER mission to Mercury began with liftoff of the Delta II 7925H launch vehicle and 1,107-kg spacecraft including seven instruments. MESSENGER is the seventh in the series of NASA Discovery missions, the third to be built and operated by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) following the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker and Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) missions. The MESSENGER team at JHU/APL is using efficient operations approaches developed in support of the low-cost NEAR and CONTOUR operations while incorporating improved approaches for reducing total mission risk. This paper provides an overview of the designs and operational practices implemented to conduct the MESSENGER mission safely and effectively. These practices include proven approaches used on past JHU/APL operations and new improvements implemented to reduce risk, including adherence to time-proven standards of conduct in the planning and implementation of the mission. This paper also discusses the unique challenges of operating in orbit around Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, and what specific measures are being taken to address those challenges.

TI Space qualification mechanical tests of HTS filters for satellite
   application
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN

DE high temperature superconductor; filter; space qualification test
ID DESIGN
AB High performance high-temperature superconducting (HTS) filters have been designed and constructed for satellite application. The filters are actually a superconducting integration of an 8-pole band-pass filter with an adjustable band-stop filter onto a single piece of LaAlO3 substrate (with dimension of 0.5x45x20 mm(3)). Typical results of the filters, i.e., Filters A (made by YBCO) & B (made by TBCCO) will be reported. The measured responses of Filter A showed excellent specifications, e.g., an insertion loss less than 0.1 dB, a return loss better than -22.5 dB in pass-band, band-edge steepness greener than 12 dB/MHz and out-of-band rejection at a certain band deeper than -110 dB. To satisfy the requirement of rocket launch and space operation, three filters of the above design have undergone mechanical environmental simulation tests for space qualification. Detailed analysis of the response curves of Filter B measured before and after the tests showed that no noticeable change in the performance can be found. All the filters passed the rigorous ground simulation tests, which is the first time in China for HTS devices and provided a solid foundation for satellite applications of high-temperature superconductors in the near future.

ID NITRATE CONTENT; VEGETABLES
AB Experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of nitrogen side dressing fertilization (0; 60.0; 120.0; 180.0 and 240.0 kg ha(-1)), applied by fertigation and distance between plants (0.05; 0.07 and 0.10 m) for rocket salad in the field and greenhouse. The experimental design was a split-plot with randomized blocks, replicated four times. In the autumn/winter and summer experiments occurred an increase in leaf area, dry mass weight, yield and content of nitrate in leaves extract with an increase of the N doses applied. Plants spaced at 0.10 m presented the highest average leaf area and dry mass weight, but the highest yield was obtained with 0.05 in space, due to the high number of plants/area. In the autumn/winter cropping, the side dressing N application rate that allowed the highest yield in field was 240.0 kg ha(-1) and in greenhouse 178.6 kg ha(-1). In the summer, in greenhouse, the estimated side dressing nitrogen application rate that allowed the highest yield under plant spaced of 0.05, 0.07 and 0.10 in were 240.0, 167.3 and 231.0 kg ha(-1), respectively.

   properties
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
AB Cylindrical and conical composite lattice structures have been used extensively as load bearing structures, especially in the aerospace industry. Because of this, the dynamic stability of structures subjected to external loads is a critical structural problem in rocket design, pressure vessels, rocket motor cases, gas tanks and aircraft where pressure occurs. Elastic instability will cause buckling and eventually lead to catastrophic failure of the structure.
   The purpose of this research was to investigate the dynamic conditions and behavior of lattice cylinders manufactured from carbon fiber/epoxy composites.
   Also, our task was to evaluate the force and free vibration including non-elastic resistance and damping properties, the variable parameters and strength characteristics of carbon fiber. Additionally, the mechanical vibration the lattice structures was calculated and to create a system which was able to register of the force frequencies and reduce the free vibration due to the maintenance of the appropriate electrical circuit. Additionally transform electrical signals to ultrasound signals, which are beneficial to avoid parametric resonance.

ID COAXIAL AIRBLAST ATOMIZERS; JET
AB Hydrogen is a widely used rocket fuel and methane is particularly of interest in Europe as a promising substitute for H-2, Experimental investigation of cryogenic reactive coaxial sprays with oxygen as an oxidizer and hydrogen and methane as fuels is conducted to prove whether concepts from the LOX/H-2 injector design can be transferred to LOX/CH4 injection. The liquid oxygen has been atomized in shear coaxial atomizers, and the sprays and flames have been investigated by visualization methods such as shadowgraphy and imaging of the flame emission. LOX sprays are characterized for both propellants by the intact core lengths and droplet numbers, and the combustion is analyzed in terms of the flame anchoring mechanism and the flame spreading angle. The results for LOX/H-2-and LOX/CH4-spray combustion are compared, and the influence of the injection conditions of the propellants on atomization and spray flame is discussed. Significant differences of the sprays and flames have been observed for the two propellant combinations at similar injection conditions, as defined by the Weber number and the momentum flux ratio. The flame stabilization process has shown a strong influence on the atomization and flame characteristics.

AB A low-speed wind-tunnel test was performed with a 3%-scale model of a booster rocket mated to an X-43A research vehicle, a combination referred to as the Hyper-X launch vehicle. The test was conducted both in freestream air and in the presence of a partial model of the B-52B airplane. The objectives of the test were to obtain force and moment data to generate structural loads affecting the pylon of the B-52B airplane and to determine the aerodynamic influence of the B-52B on the Hyper-X launch vehicle for evaluating launch separation characteristics. The wind-tunnel test was conducted at a low-speed wind tunnel in Hampton, Virginia. All moments and forces reported are based either on the aerodynamic influence of the B-52B airplane or are for the Hyper-X launch vehicle in freestream air. Overall, the test showed that the B-52B airplane imparts a strong downwash onto the Hyper-X launch vehicle, reducing the net lift of the Hyper-X launch vehicle. Pitching and rolling moments are also imparted onto the booster and are a strong function of the launch-drop angle of attack.

AB We have designed and fabricated a low energy plasma calibration facility for testing and calibration of rocket-borne charged-particle detectors and for the investigation of plasma sheath formation in an environment with ionospheric plasma energies, densities, and Debye lengths. We describe the vacuum system and associated plasma source, which was modified from a Naval Research Laboratory design [Bowles Rev. Sci. Instrum. 67, 455 (1996)]. Mechanical and electrical modifications to this cylindrical microwave resonant source are outlined together with a different method of operating the magnetron that achieves a stable discharge. This facility produces unmagnetized plasmas with densities from 1x10(3)/cm(3) to 6x10(5)/cm(3), electron temperatures from 0.1 to 1.7 eV, and plasma potentials from 0.5 to 8 V depending on varying input microwave power and neutral gas flow. For the range of input microwave power explored (350-600 W), the energy density of the plasma remains constant because of an inverse relationship between density and temperature. This relationship allows a wide range of Debye lengths (0.3-8.4 cm) to be investigated, which is ideal for simulating the ionospheric plasma sheaths we explore.

TI Processing spinach response to selected herbicides for weed control,

SO WEED TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE processing spinach production; weed control; spinach injury
ID PREEMERGENCE; OLERACEA
AB Only two spinach herbicides are currently available to producers, and with limited choices in herbicide mode of action (MOA), overuse of the Current herbicides can result in dominance of uncontrolled weeds. Therefore, spinach producers need more herbicide options. Trials were conducted in processing spinach to evaluate the crop safety of dimethenamid-p (0.56 k, ai/ha), EPTC (2.94 to 3.40 kg ai/ha), or ethofumesate (0.84, 1.12 or 2.24 kg ai/ha) applied pre-emergent (PRE), and ethofumesate (0.09 or 0.18 kg ai/ha) applied early postemergent (EPOST) for potential use as alternatives to s-metolachlor (0.73 k, ai/ha) and cycloate (2-52 kg ai/ha). The control of London rocket was excellent with s-metolachlor, dimethenamid-p, and ethofumesate. Weed control with cycloate and EPTC was fair, and generally inferior to all others. Cycloate and s-metolachlor were safe to spinach, and only minor crop injury was observed with all other herbicides, except the high rate of ethofurnesate PRE, which resulted in high levels of injury. Spinach outgrew all early herbicide injury with no significant yield losses. Ethofumesate applied EPOST caused no injury in year 1, although in year 2 injury was higher in all plots where it was applied twice, regardless of rate. In high-density plantings, dimethenamid-p caused significant crop injure to spinach, but only at one location on a sandy learn soil. In that trial, yields in dimethenamid-p plots were reduced an average 30% compared to the hand-weeded and s-metolachlor plots. As a result of this research, dimethenamid-p, EPTC, and ethofumesate should be considered candidates for expanded-use registrations in processing spinach production. More research is needed to determine additional rates and use patterns for improved crop safety, as well as an evaluation of soil types and spinach varieties.

AB This paper will describe the history, technology and design features of the XP spaceplane being developed by Rocketplane Ltd. in Oklahoma. The XP is a four seat fighter-sized spaceplane that uses turbojets for takeoff and landing and a liquid oxygen/kerosene rocket engine for main propulsion during its ascent to a 100km apogee suborbital space flight.
   The XP is intended to serve a variety of markets including suborbital tourist flights, intermediate duration microgravity research, remote sensing, astronomy, and microsatellite launch missions. Changes in vehicle configuration and flight profile for serving each of these markets will be described.
   The prototype XP will have its rollout ceremony at the end of 2007 and will begin test flights in early 2008. Commercial space flight operations are expected to begin in fall 2008 with tourist flights and microgravity research flights being the early customer base.
   The spaceplane's flight systems, safety systems, and operating procedures will be reviewed. In addition, key elements of the Rocketplane business and financial model will be discussed. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Options for development flight testing (DFT) of the Ares I crew launch vehicle (CLV) are discussed. The Ares I CLV is being developed by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to launch the crew exploration vehicle (CEV) into low Earth orbit (LEO). The Ares I implements one of the components of the vision for space exploration (VSE), providing crew and cargo access to the International Space Station (ISS) after retirement of the space shuttle and, eventually, forming part of the launch capability needed for lunar exploration. The role of DFT is to demonstrate key subsystems, address key technical risks, and provide flight data to validate engineering models in representative flight environments. This is distinguished from certification flight testing, which is designed to formally validate system functionality and achieve flight readiness. Lessons learned from Saturn V, space shuttle, and other flight programs are examined along with key Ares I technical risks in order to provide insight into possible DFF strategies. A strategy for the first test flight of the Ares 1, known as Ares I-1, is presented. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI On the damping effect due to bolted junctions in space structures
   subjected to pyro-shock
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
ID JOINTS
AB The damping due to bolted or riveted joints in the dynamics of assembled structures subjected to pyro-shock has been studied. A relevant effect in this phenomenon is the micro-slip between the jointed surfaces. In order to verify the feasibility and the reliability of the numerical analyses performed on structures with junctions, the numerical results obtained by the finite elements method have been compared with those obtained experimentally. Several numerical analyses, in which friction forces have been represented as nonlinear loads, have been carried out for the FE models of two application cases: an electronic unit mounted within the Radarsat-2 satellite, and the complete Cosmo-Skymed spacecraft. Considering the load type, involving a typical high frequency response spectrum between 100 and 10000Hz, both numerical and experimental data have been reduced to the shock response spectrum form. After the comparative evaluation, taking into account also the damping effect, the agreement between numerical results and experimental data has been evaluated. The proposed numerical approach yields an effective and less expensive instrument, able to provide indications in the design phase, to allow the prevision of the dynamic behaviour of the structure for the prevention of failures in units or systems mounted within the spacecraft or launch vehicle. With the proposed model, it is possible to determine in a simple and direct way the characteristics of the damping due to the single bolted and riveted joints, and use them in similar multiple joints in the complete structure assembling or substructuring.

TI Fiber optic Raman sensor to monitor the concentration ratio of nitrogen

AB A spontaneous Raman scattering optical fiber sensor was developed for a specific need of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for long-term detection and monitoring of the purity of liquid oxygen (LO2) in the oxidizer feed line during ground testing of rocket engines. The Raman peak intensity ratios for liquid nitrogen (LN2) and LO2 with varied weight ratios (LN2/LO2) were analyzed for their applicability to impurity sensing. The study of the sensor performance with different excitation light sources has helped to design a miniaturized, cost-effective system for this application. The optimal system response time of this miniaturized sensor for LN2/LO2 measurement was found to be in the range of a few seconds. It will need to be further reduced to the millisecond range for real-time, quantitative monitoring of the quality of cryogenic fluids in a harsh envioronment. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB Past explosion events in process facilities have centered attention on the fact that missiles generated as the result of vessel fragmentation pose significant risk to personnel and process equipment and can trigger knock-on or domino effects in industrial accidents. To promote the design of inherently safer facilities-and to enable more effective mitigation and control measures with respect to missile risks-it is necessary to perform missile risk analysis studies at the early design phase. To aid in such an analysis and to predict domino scenarios, it is essential to have models that can quantify (1) the probability of a missile impact on a target and (2) the consequences of the probable impact.
   In the present work, we propose a model to quantify the probability of missiles that originate from bursting horizontal cylinders, having an impact on spherical target vessels located in a process area. Although previous investigations on the quantification of missile impact probability were based on a single-scenario approach, the current model is based on two credible scenarios. The model is built on the concept of a vulnerable area (VA), defined as the probable impact zone sketched around the target object. The concept of an effective range interval (ERI) was adopted and was extended by introducing an effective trajectory interval (ETI) and effective orientation interval (EOI). The uncertainties in the model parameters were addressed by means of Monte Carlo sampling approach. A case study is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The case study uses a grid-based approach (GBA) to provide interactive contour plotting of the missile impact probabilities over a defined process area.

AB A solid rocket propellant based on glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) binder plasticized with nitrate esters and oxidized with a mixture of ammonium nitrate (AN) and triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN) and including non-lead ballistic modifiers, was formulated. The propellant was designed so as to produce non-acidic and non-toxic exhaust products while still providing reasonably good burning rate and impulse. This propellant was characterized with respect to thermal and chemical stability and storage life by a variety of test methods. ne data indicate that the propellant exhibits good stability and is suitably safe for prolonged storage. Characterization data for this propellant with regard to processing parameters, tensile properties, and ballistic performance are presented in a companion paper.

AB A new method is proposed that sharply increases the amount of statistical information extracted from chemical experiments. The new statistical technology is particularly suited for scarce sample populations, when the new method proves the only means that allows the successful structuring of a histogram by increasing with one order of magnitude the extracted information. Hidden features would remain inaccessible otherwise. The method is proposed for very scarce samples that often occur in medical care and laboratory analyzes or in barely accessible environments, The chemical manufacturing of high explosives or propellants is such an example. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by numerical examples in experimental measurement of the combustion heat of rocket propellants, based on the previous experience of the author, as chief of research laboratory in the Romanian chemical industry. Given examples show that the new method is efficient for normal Gaussian distributions and for abnormal ones as well, Populations as small as of six elements are thus successfully processed and statistically characterized, while the regular statistics could only be applied to populations involving at least forty elements.

AB Both the asymptotical stability criterion and the bounded stability criterion of the coning motion for wrap around fin (WAF) rockets are proposed through the analysis of coning motion equations, which can be easily used to determine the existence of the coning motion during the rocket design. The correctness of the criterions is verified by mathematical simulation examples of a WAF rocket with different setting angles. It is also found that the setting angle of WAF has great effects on the rolling moment and side moment of the rocket.

AB The performance of several overlay coatings on Cu-8 at. %Cr4%Nb alloy (GRCop-84) thermally cycled in a high heat flux hydrogen-oxygen combustion flame are reported. Finite element analyses (FEA) were conducted to evaluate the expected performances of coatings with different thermal conductivities as well as to determine a suitable thickness for coating deposition. Top coats consisting of Cu-26%Cr, NiAl and NiCrAlY along with a Cu-8%Cr bond coat were vacuum plasma sprayed on GRCop-84 thin sheet specimens. It was observed that the Cu-26%Cr coating formed blisters whereas the NiAl and NiCrAlY coatings showed no significant differences between the exposed and unexposed specimens. Water-cooled rectangular specimens specially designed to simulate a rocket engine liner were coated with a NiCrAlY-top coat using either a Cu-8%Cr or a Cu-8%Cr-1%Al bond coat. Preliminary tests conducted on these specimens showed no visible evidence of coating spallation after 40 cycles. The measured temperatures and heat fluxes were used in FEA models to estimate the stresses, strains and temperatures across the coating interfaces in these specimens. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The Korea Sounding Rocket-III (KSR-III) was successfully launched on November 28, 2002 from the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. The science payload onboard the KSR-III included an ozone detector and two magnetometers along with other various sensors installed to measure physical characteristics such as temperature, pressure, strain, and acceleration. The main objective of KSR-III was to evaluate the liquid propulsion engine system which has been newly adopted in the KSR series. In addition to this main objective, the science payload conducted atmospheric soundings. The payload data were transmitted to the ground station in real time by an onboard telemetry system. The UV radiometer measured the direct solar UV radiation and during the ascending phase the vertical ozone density profile was obtained. This result was compared with coincident measurements taken by other satellites, a ground station, and an ozonesonde. A fluxgate-type magnetometer was onboard the KSR-III to observe the Earth's DC magnetic field and for AC field measurements, a search-coil magnetometer was installed. This was the first Korean mission to use magnetometers on a rocket-borne platform to measure the Earth's magnetic field. Using the telemetry magnetometer data, a study on the rocket attitude was carried out. This paper will give an overview of the design, calibration, and test results of the science payload onboard the KSR-III. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LIQUID
AB In this paper we report on the set-up and the performance of an experiment for the investigation of flow-rate limitations in open capillary channels under low-gravity conditions (microgravity). The channels consist of two parallel plates bounded by free liquid surfaces along the open sides. In the case of steady flow the capillary pressure of the free surface balances the differential pressure between the liquid and the surrounding constant-pressure gas phase. A maximum flow rate is achieved when the adjusted volumetric flow rate exceeds a certain limit leading to a collapse of the free surfaces. The flow is convective (inertia) dominated, since the viscous forces are negligibly small compared to the convective forces. In order to investigate this type of flow an experiment aboard the sounding rocket TEXUS-41 was performed. The aim of the investigation was to achieve the profiles of the free liquid surfaces and to determine the maximum flow rate of the steady flow. For this purpose a new approach to the critical flow condition by enlarging the channel length was applied. The paper is focussed on the technical details of the experiment and gives a review of the set-up, the preparation of the flight procedures and the performance. Additionally the typical appearance of the flow indicated by the surface profiles is presented as a basis for a separate continuative discussion of the experimental results.

DE precooled air-breathing engine; heat exchanger; LACE; SABRE; Skylon;
   SSTO
AB The issues relevant to propulsion design for Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) vehicles are considered. In particular two air-breathing engine concepts involving precooling are compared; SABRE (Synergetic Air-Breathing and Rocket Engine) as designed for the Skylon SSTO launch vehicle, and a LACE (Liquid Air Cycle Engine) considered in the 1960's by the Americans for an early generation spaceplane. It is shown that through entropy minimisation the SABRE has made substantial gains in performance over the traditional LACE precooled engine concept, and has shown itself as the basis of a viable means of realising a SSTO vehicle. Further, it is demonstrated that the precooler is a major source of thermodynamic irreversibility within the engine cycle and that further reduction in entropy can be realised by increasing the heat transfer coefficient on the air side of the precooler. If this were to be achieved, it would improve the payload mass delivered to orbit by the Skylon launch vehicle by between 5 and 10%.

AB An innovative projectile design is proposed using body-conformal oblique wing/tails with smart-structure control. With optimal deployments of the oblique wing, this guided projectile would maintain the maximum lift-to-drag ratio throughout its gliding phase, from supersonic through fransonic to subsonic, and achieve an extended range which, exceeds the maximum range required for the baseline' rocket-assisted projectile. To search for the optimal sweepback positions of the oblique wing during the supersonic and transonic gliding phases, intensive thin-layer Reynold saveraged Navier-Stokes computations are performed using the overset-grid approach. Based on the optimal scheduling of the oblique wing obtained from the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computations, our preliminary two degrees-of-freedom trajectory analysis indicates that the target 100 n mile range is achievable without rocket assistance.

AB The aim of this paper is to present an experimental validation of a frequency-domain approach to the solution of the lightning electromagnetic field-to-buried cable coupling equations. The coupling to the inner conductor is evaluated using the concept of cable transfer impedance. The theoretical model and relevant computer code are tested using experimental data on lightning-induced currents in buried cables carried out in 2002 and 2003 at the International Center for Lightning Research & Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, Florida where currents induced by triggered lightning events were measured at the ends of a buried coaxial cable, both in the shield and in the inner cable conductors. Reasonably good agreement has been found between numerical simulations and recorded waveforms. In particular, the early-time response of the cable and the peak value of the induced currents were generally well reproduced by the simulations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using a wide spectrum of completed air-breathing and rocket-powered launch vehicle baseline configurations, an assessment was undertaken to ascertain each vehicle system's scaling response to empty weight growth. To establish the growth behavior, each vehicle's baseline solution was modified for percentage increases or decreases in the baseline empty weight from +10 % to -10 %, after which each vehicle system was then re-solved. The identification of the trends in these solutions enabled the determination of the growth factor for each vehicle configuration. The growth factor characterizes the system's sensitivity to changes in structural weight arising from technological uncertainty. Systems with high growth factors represent a greater amount of design risk because they may rapidly scale out of control if expected technology levels fail to materialize. This understanding may also be applied to measure the extent of improvements possible from application of more advanced technology. Several other figures of merit were also used to evaluate the growth solutions, including empty weight, wetted area, and gross weight. The assessment concluded that single-stage air breathers have a higher response to weight uncertainty than two-stage configurations with the horizontal takeoff mode being more sensitive than vertical takeoff. Two-stage air-breathing configurations, whereas exhibiting lower growth factors, differed greatly from each other in total empty weight across the growth cases with the vertical takeoff mode roughly half the weight of comparable horizontal takeoff configurations. Two-stage reusable rocket configurations also show low scaling weight growth factors and empty weights and are relatively insensitive to small percentage growth changes.

AB In present, due to continuous increasing of the fracture toughness and continuous reduction of steel plate thickness for ultra-high strength steel used in the aerospace solid rocket motor, it is difficult to measure its fracture toughness of surface crack using the linear elastic fracture mechanics method. In this paper, the tensile test was used to achieve the conditional load when the surface crack initiation occurred. Then, the finite element method (FEM) was conducted to calculate the ductile fracture toughness J(IC) under the conditional load. Lastly, the surface crack fracture toughness, K-le, can be computed from J(IC) based on the fracture mechanics method. In addition, the analysis on validity of J-integral showed that K-le, converted from J(IC) was able to evaluate the fracture toughness of ultra-high strength steel. These are important technical parameters for design of aerospace solid rocket motor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent fully relativistic calculations of radiative rates and electron impact excitation cross-sections for Fe XIII are used to generate emission-line ratios involving 3s(2)3p(2) - 3s3p(3) and 3s(2)3p(2) - 3s(2)3p3d transitions in the 170 - 225 and 235 - 450 angstrom wavelength ranges covered by the Solar Extreme-Ultraviolet Research Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS). A comparison of these line ratios with SERTS active region observations from rocket flights in 1989 and 1995 reveals generally very good agreement between theory and experiment. Several new Fe XIII emission features are identified, at wavelengths of 203.79, 259.94, 288.56 and 290.81 angstrom. However, major discrepancies between theory and observation remain for several Fe XIII transitions, as previously found by Landi and others, which cannot be explained by blending. Errors in the adopted atomic data appear to be the most likely explanation, in particular for transitions which have 3s(2)3p3d D-1(2) as their upper level. The most useful Fe XIII electron-density diagnostics in the SERTS spectral regions are assessed, in terms of the line pairs involved being (i) apparently free of atomic physics problems and blends, (ii) close in wavelength to reduce the effects of possible errors in the instrumental intensity calibration, and (iii) very sensitive to changes in Ne over the range 10(8) - 10(11) cm(-3). It is concluded that the ratios which best satisfy these conditions are 200.03/202.04 and 203.17/202.04 for the 170 - 225 angstrom wavelength region, and 348.18/320.80, 348.18/368.16, 359.64/348.18 and 359.83/368.16 for 235 - 450 angstrom.

ID FLOWS; MODEL
AB The plug nozzle is one of the advanced expansion devices proposed to improve the overall performance of launcher liquid rocket engines. The present work investigates the three-dimensional flow field generated on this kind of nozzle by partitioning the primary nozzle into modules. A linear plug nozzle has been designed together with modules having two different geometries: a rectangular cross section and round-to-square module. Numerical simulations have been carried out considering the case where all modules of the primary nozzle are active and the case where one module is turned off. The solutions are compared and specific three-dimensional flow structures taking place inside the modules and on the plug are identified. The relationship between these structures and the skin friction distribution within the module and along the plug surface is investigated. Finally, the effect on performance of these three-dimensional flow features is emphasized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS
AB An optimization approach, based on computational fluid dynamics methodology, is investigated for the performance prediction and optimization of liquid rocket engine nozzle. The CFD code employs implicit Lower-Upper decomposition (LU) scheme for solving the two-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and species transport equations in an efficient manner. The validity of the code is demonstrated by comparing the numerical calculations with both the experimental data and previous calculations. Then the code, called by three optimization algorithms (i.e. successive quadratic programming method, genetic algorithm and interdigitation strategy) respectively, is used to design axisymmetric Optimum-thrust nozzle. Results show that improvement on nozzle thrust can be obtained over that of the baseline case. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID MOTORS
AB A fast computational method for simulating the evolution of the burning surface of a complex, three-dimensional solid rocket motor propellant grain has been developed using a signed minimum distance function. The minimum distance function is calculated using stereo-lithography surface information from a computer-aided-design file and propellant surface burnback is simulated by manipulation of the initial minimum distance function. Variable time stepping and multiple spatial grids further reduce computation time requirements. Results indicate that this method gives adequate accuracy with acceptable computation time for time scales of the full motor burn. The resulting code (Rocgrain) allows for motor grain design by user-friendly commercial computer-aided-design programs and for coupling with internal flow codes. This enables a single geometric tool to be used for describing the propellant grain geometry for both grain design and internal flowfield analysis. The Rocgrain code can be coupled with a variety of flowfield codes ranging in complexity from simple zero-dimensional to more sophisticated computational fluid dynamics analysis (e.g., nonlinear acoustic instability).

AB Compressible turbulent flows are an important element of high-speed flight. Boundary layers developing along fuselage and wings of an aircraft and along engine compressor and turbine blades are compressible and mostly turbulent. The high-speed flow around rockets and through rocket nozzles involves compressible turbulence and flow separation. Turbulent mixing and combustion in scramjet engines is another example where compressibility dominates the flow physics. Although compressible turbulent flows have attracted researchers since the fifties of the last century, they are not completely understood. Especially interactions between compressible turbulence and combustion lead to challenging, yet unsolved problems. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) represent modern powerful research tools which allow to mimic such flows in great detail and to analyze underlying physical mechanisms, even those which cannot be accessed by the experiment.
   The present lecture provides a short description of these tools and some of their numerical characteristics. It then describes DNS and LES results of fully-developed channel and pipe flow and highlights effects of compressibility on the turbulence structure. The analysis of pressure fluctuations in such flows with isothermal cooled walls leads to the conclusion that the pressure-strain correlation tensor decreases in the wall layer and that the turbulence anisotropy increases, since the mean density falls off relative to the incompressible flow case. Similar increases in turbulence anisotropy due to compressibility are observed in inert and reacting temporal mixing layers. The nature of the pressure fluctuations is however two-facetted. While inert compressible mixing layers reveal wave-propagation effects in the pressure and density fluctuations, compressible reacting mixing layers seem to generate pressure fluctuations that. are controlled by the time-rate of change of heat release and mean density variation as sources in the pressure Poisson equation rather than wave propagation phenomena. This opens new challenges to turbulence modellers and underlines the need to treat compressibility effects via the full Reynolds stress equations. (c) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Weinheim.

AB "Rocket" is a collective name used to term some species within the Eruca and Diplotaxis genera, whose leaves are characterized by a more or less pungent taste. Different approaches have been carried out to differentiate both genera that have similar leaf morphologies. Following our research in flavonoid profiling of the Brassicaceae family using high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet-diode array detection/electrospray ionization mass spectroemtry, we have investigated Eruca vesicaria and Diplotaxis tenuifolia leaf samples as new ingredients of fresh salads. The MS/MS study allowed the identification of new naturally occurring quercetin mono- and diacyl-tri-O-glucosides and the elucidation of the flavonoid glycosylation and acylation patterns. Important differences between flavonoid profiles of E. vesicaria and D. tenuifolia were observed. E. vesicaria contained kaempferol derivatives as principal compounds whereas D. tenuifolia instead accumulated quercetin derivatives. The exhaustive study of the profiling of these species could help further studies concerning the bioavailability of these flavonoids for epidemiological or clinical intervention studies because these species have considerable potential as healthy leafy salads because of the bioactive phytochemicals.

TI Measurements of NOX produced by rocket-triggered lightning
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

DT Article
ID NITROGEN-OXIDES; DISCHARGES; THUNDERSTORM; OZONE; FIXATION; FLASHES
AB We present the first direct measurements of NOX generated by specific lightning sources. In July 2005, three negative lightning flashes were triggered using the rocket-and-wire technique at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, Florida. The NOX produced by these three rocket-triggered flashes was measured. The NOX production per unit charge was between 2 and 3 . 10(20) molecules per meter per coulomb. The data show that the NOX production is primarily from long-duration, steady currents, as opposed to microsecond-scale impulsive return stroke currents. This observation implies that cloud discharges, which transfer, via a steady current of the order of 100 A, larger charges than ground discharges, but do not contain return strokes, are as efficient as ( or more efficient than) cloud-to-ground discharges in producing NOX.

AB Different multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems are formulated and compared. Two MDO formulations are applied to a sounding rocket in order to optimize the performance of the rocket. In the MDO of the referred vehicle, three disciplines have been considered, which are trajectory, propulsion and aerodynamics. A special design structure matrix is developed to assist data exchange between disciplines. This design process uses response surface method (RSM) for multidisciplinary optimization of the rocket. The RSM is applied to the design in two categories: the propulsion model and the system level. In the propulsion model, RSM determines an approximate mathematical model of the engine output parameters as a function of design variables. In the system level, RSM fits a surface of objective function versus design variables. In the first MDO problem formulation, two design variables are selected to form propulsion discipline. In the second one, three new design variables from geometry are added and finally, an optimization method is applied to the response surface in the system level in order to find the best result. Application of the first developed multidisciplinary design optimization procedure increased accessible altitude (performance index) of the referred sounding rocket by twenty five percents and the second one twenty nine.

ID FABRIC COMPOSITES; STIFFNESS; COMPACTION; STRENGTH; STRAIN
AB Thick fabric composite cylinders for nozzle parts in solid rocket motors should be designed to endure the extreme temperature and pressure of combustion gas. As the thickness of the composite cylinder increases, fabricational residual stresses due to the anisotropic thermal expansion or shrinkage of fabric composites also increase, which induces inter-laminar failures. Therefore, the accurate estimation of the residual stresses is indispensable for the development of thick fabric composite cylinders.
   In this paper, the residual stresses in thick cylinders made of carbon fabric phenolic composites were measured by a new radialcut-cylinder-bending method. To obtain the residual stresses from the measured relative strains during the radial-cut operation, a bending test of the cylinder with the radial-cut was performed instead of measuring the material properties with respect to radial positions. The thermal residual stresses were also calculated by finite element method considering shear deformation of fabric layers, and compared with the measured residual stresses by the new method, from which it was found that the new simple method estimated the residual stresses pretty well. Also the inter-laminar tensile strength at the position of maximum radial residual stress could be obtained from the bending test. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many advances in electromagnetic (EM) propulsion technology have occurred in recent years. Linear motor technology for low-velocity and high-mass applications is being developed for naval catapults. Such technology could serve as the basis for a first-stage booster launch-as suggested by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the Maglifter concept. Using railguns, laboratory experiments have demonstrated launch velocities of 2-3 km/s and muzzle energies >8 MJ. The extension of this technology to the muzzle velocities (>= 7500 m/s) and energies (>= 10 GJ) needed for the direct launch of payloads into orbit is very challenging but may not be impossible. For launch to orbit, even long launchers (>1000 m) would need to operate at accelerations >1000 G to reach the required velocities, so it would only be possible to launch rugged payloads, such as fuel, water, and materiel. Interest is being shown in such concepts by US, European, Russian, and Chinese researchers. An intermediate step proposed in France could be to launch payloads to sounding rocket altitudes for ionospheric research.

AB In this work, a gouged section of 1080 railroad rail steel is examined using metallographic techniques to characterize the nature of the damage. The gouging was performed by a rocket sled at Holloman Air Force Base, riding on VascoMax 300 steel shoes at 2.1 km/s. The damaged rail is evaluated in detail to examine material phase changes, shear bands, and heat effects. The results are compared to samples of the virgin material, machined and prepared exactly as they are prior to the Holloman AFB High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) runs. The gouged section was examined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and other techniques. The resulting microstructure is presented and compared to the virgin material. Material mixing, shear band formation, and significant thermal damage, consistent with a high energy gouging event, are confirmed. In addition, the material phase change, evident in this approach allows us to estimate the thermal conditions present during the formation of the gouge. This thermal history establishes a profile by which related research in gouge simulation can be validated against. A one-dimensional heat conduction model is presented that validates the cooling rates required to generate the presented microstructure.

AB Three efficient and practical approaches for the design of an adaptive autopilot for a launch vehicle (LV) attitude control system during atmospheric flight are presented. The proposed adaptive control schemes are developed on the basis of different combinations of gain scheduling, decoupling, and the model reference adaptive technique. A new adaptation mechanism based on hyperstability theory is developed. Every scheme contains some degree of adaptation, corresponding to its complexity and cost of realization. A six-degree-of-freedom non-linear simulation was used to compare the adaptation characteristics of the proposed schemes in the presence of different disturbances during atmospheric flight of the vehicle.

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an analog technique for the demodulation of interferometric fiber optic gyroscopes signals, based on the calculation of the mean value of the negative cycles of the measured photodetector signal from sinusoidally modulated Sagnac gyroscopes. The developed signal processing circuit was implemented and tested in a laboratory, and it was possible to detect signals as low as 5 mu rad. Experimental results measured in a 890 m fiber optic coil gyroscope equipped with the developed circuit showed that the proposed circuit, when compared to the widely used and mature lock-in amplifier technique, presented a 5.1 dB higher signal-to-noise ratio. The circuit is also very stable with the temperature, since a very low drift of 0.04 degrees/h degrees C was measured in a complete gyroscope system. The Brazilian research sounding rocket VSB-30 is currently being equipped with the developed demodulator circuit. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

TI Improvements in the measurement of distillation curves. 4. Application
   to the aviation turbine fuel Jet-A
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COMBUSTION; ENTHALPY
AB We have recently introduced several important improvements in the measurement of distillation curves for complex fluids. The modifications to the classical measurement provide for (1) temperature and volume measurements of low uncertainty, (2) temperature control based upon fluid behavior, and, most important, (3) a composition-explicit data channel in addition to the usual temperature-volume relationship. This latter modification is achieved with a new sampling approach that allows precise qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of each fraction, on the fly. We have applied the new method to the measurement of rocket propellant, gasoline, and jet fuels. In this paper, we present the application of the technique to representative batches of the important aviation fuel Jet-A. The motivation behind the work is to provide a property database for the planned expansion of the use of military aviation fuel JP-8, which is nearly identical to Jet-A. JP-8 also contains an icing inhibitor, corrosion/lubricity enhancer, and antistatic additive. This fluid (JP-8) is currently the primary gas turbine fuel used by the United States Air Force and also naval shore-based aircraft. There is now interest in the United States Department of Defense to use this fuel for all military applications, including ground-based forces. This would mean use of JP-8 in tanks, armored personnel carriers, and other vehicles. This interest has renewed interest in the chemical and physical properties of JP-8, to facilitate adaptation and design. Since one of the most important design parameters for a fuel is the distillation curve, it is critical that the new approach be applied to the base fluid representative for JP-8, namely, Jet-A.

This achievement was made possible by an initial group of 118 German rocket specialists to which others were gradually added. The contributions to rocketry, upper atmosphere and space research, and eventually manned space travel provided by Germany's Wernher von Braun and his team of engineers, scientists, technicians and support personnel is, in particular, described, and the ongoing influence of the innovations they introduced is considered.

AB Meteoric smoke particles have been proposed as a key player in the formation and evolution of mesospheric phenomena. Despite their apparent importance still very little is known about these particles. Important questions concern the smoke number density and size distribution as a function of altitude as well as the fraction of charged particles. Sounding rockets are used to measure smoke in situ, but aerodynamics has remained a major challenge. Basically, the small smoke particles tend to follow the gas flow around the payload rather than reaching the detector if aerodynamics is not considered carefully in the detector design. So far only indirect evidence for the existence of meteoric smoke has been available from measurements of heavy charge carriers. Quantitative ways are needed that relate these measured particle population to the atmospheric particle population. This requires in particular knowledge about the size-dependent, altitude-dependent and charge-dependent detection efficiency for a given instrument. In this paper, we investigate the aerodynamics for a typical electrostatic detector design. We first quantify the flow field of the background gas, then introduce particles in the flow field and determine their trajectories around the payload structure. We use two different models to trace particles in the flow field, a Continuous motion model and a Brownian motion model. Brownian motion is shown to be of basic importance for the smallest particles. Detection efficiencies are determined for three detector designs, including two with ventilation holes to allow airflow through the detector. Results from this investigation show that rocket-borne smoke detection with conventional detectors is largely limited to altitudes above 75 km. The flow through a ventilated detector has to be relatively large in order to significantly improve the detection efficiency.

AB Coaxial injection is a very common system in industrial burners or rocket engines. Theoretical studies involving different hypotheses have been devoted to this subject. Experimental studies have been performed in several individual configurations. Subsequently, many correlations are proposed in the literature. All these expressions do not take into account the same basic quantities, which may be troublesome for injector designers. In the present work, we have performed experiments in a system where both geometry and liquid characteristics could be varied over a wide range. Changes in atomization regimes, liquid core length, and spray angle are especially examined in the present paper. They were estimated using fast shadowgraphy. We show that the momentum flux ratio plays a key role in all these quantities in the dense core zone. Gas flow Reynolds number is also important for disintegration mode classification. Empirical correlations show that liquid's physical properties (viscosity or surface tension) have little influence on the atomization process in the range studied. The Rayleigh instability growth rate model, based on the existence of a shear layer at the interface, seems to be the most suitable in predicting the dense core zone properties, showing that primary atomization in coaxial injectors is essentially ruled by aerodynamic effects.

AB Coaxial injectors find many applications in industrial burners or rocket engines. Scaling these devices is therefore an important challenge for burner designers. Theoretical scaling relations for spray properties have been proposed by several authors. Systematic experimental study of gaseous flow properties is already available in the literature. We have found it useful to perform a systematic experimental study of liquid physical properties and injector dimensions, which are typical scaling parameters for applications. The experimental setup used in the present work enables nine different geometrical configurations and a set of various liquid mixtures. Averaged droplets' size and velocities were measured using phase Doppler anemometry. Our experimental results confirm the scaling rules based on the capillary instability theory for the primary atomization zone. Different results are found for the two main atomization regimes: fiber and superpulsating modes. The characteristics of the spray produced it? the fiber mode are strongly linked to primary atomization. The superpulsating mode provides a better quality spray, in terms of averaged droplets diameter, but is more dependent on secondary atomization phenomena. Finally, correlations involving momentum flux ratio, Weber number, gaseous flow Reynolds number, and diameter ratio are proposed. They complete the correlations of the literature involving liquid and gaseous flow densities.

AB Background and purpose: Research supports the use of body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) in patients with hemi-paresis and may show promise as a gait training and neuromuscular re-education intervention in the blast-injured, traumatic brain injury (TBI) population. The purpose of this case study is to document the use BWSTT and goal-directed therapy in the improvement of gait quality, gait speed and maximum distance ambulated in a blast injury survivor with TBI.
   Case description: A 36-year-old male soldier injured by a rocket propelled grenade in Iraq who began physical therapy and gait training incorporating purposeful postural stability and mobility interventions as well as BWSTT.
   Outcomes: Missouri Assisted Gait scores, six-minute walk distances, and maximum distance ambulated all increased post gait training with BWSTT as a component to PT intervention.
   Discussion: Intensive gait training including BWSTT may have some efficacy in managing significant blast trauma patients with TBI however, further research is necessary to establish efficacy and appropriateness in this patient population.

AB Enhanced performance of propellants and explosives is the most sought-after attribute for ambitious research programs in the field of high energy materials. Convergence of defence and space sector priorities has always kept research and development efforts in the area of propellants to the forefront. With the diminishing boundaries between rocket and gun propellants, as well as explosives, the possibility of low-vulnerable munitions with high performance potentials and spin-off advantages of research on rocket propellants are also emerging on the forefront. At the same time, an increasing predominance of missiles in today's military warfare, as well as the space sector, has brought the issue of pollution by chlorine-containing combustion products of modern ammonium- perchlorate-based propellants into focus. A drastic transformation of high energy material technology is in offing. Research and development efforts made in this direction have brought an array of new materials into prominence. This paper reviews the recent work done in the frontier areas of advanced novel high energy materials. This paper covers the global scenario in the development of oxidizers, binders, plasticizers, high energy density materials, and insensitive high energy materials.

AB A systematic approach is presented to approximate the Pareto optimal front (POF) by a response surface approximation. The data for the POF is obtained by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Improvements to address drift in the POF are also presented. The approximated POF can help visualize and quantify trade-offs among objectives to select compromise designs. The bounds of this approximate POF are obtained using multiple convex-hulls. The proposed approach is applied to study trade-offs among objectives of a rocket injector design problem where performance and life objectives compete. The POF is approximated using a quintic polynomial. The compromise region quantifies trade-offs among objectives. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE electric armor; electromagnetic armor; shaped charge jet disruption
AB Shaped charges are a warhead technology often applied to rocket propelled grenades and represent a dangerous threat for armored vehicles in combat as well as in peace-keeping operations. Their armor piercing performance rests upon an explosively induced collapse of a metallic liner to a stretching jet with very high particle velocities. A copper jet produced by a shaped charge can be distorted by high electric currents injected into the jet by means of spaced electrode plates connected to a high voltage capacitor. In tests carried out at Fraunhofer EMI, a shaped charge with a well characterized jet was used for the experiments in order to examine the current flow through the jet and its effect on the jet evolution. The measured current flow is related to the jet dynamics and the distortion pattern observed by multiple flash X-ray images. As expected, the current flow starts when the jet tip reaches the back electrode plate. No significant change of the current flow is observed at the characteristic jet break-up time. The current flow continues after the tail of the copper jet has left the electrodes and resembles a damped sinusoidal. A distortion of the jet is observed where the jet particles are not aligned along the jet axis. Instead the particles are stretched orthogonally to the jet axis with increased separation along the jet axis. The tip part of the jet is hardly affected. The jet distortion is analyzed with respect to jet dynamics and current flow which allows formulating criteria for the design of electric armor systems. The current injection effective for jet distortion is limited to a time slot of a magnitude of 60 mu s for the 44-mm caliber-shaped charge used in the experiments. To a first approximation, the current flow can be modeled by an electric arc. An electric circuit model can describe the current flow behavior with respect to the electric impedance and allows designing an electrical circuit adequate for the time slot. By the analogy of a wire explosion the necessary current magnitude for an effective jet disruption with respect to the interaction time slot can be estimated to begin at 300 kA. For the tip portion of the shaped charge jet, the time of effective current injection is very short. When the current starts to set in, the jet tip is already passing the back electrode plate. For this reason, an effective distortion of the jet tip represents a challenge that has to be mastered.

AB A Railgun-concept for the launch of small payloads into low-Earth orbits is currently under investigation. The first major project milestone foresees a 32-MJ railgun system able to launch nonpropelled projectiles with experiments for high-atmospheric research to an altitude of 115 km. This will be followed by a system to launch single-stage rocket-propelled projectiles to put in orbit nanosatellites using a 3.4-GJ railgun with a length of 180 m. One of the main issues to be investigated is the extreme thermal conditions the projectile's surfaces are exposed to, namely high temperatures and high thermal loads. These are caused by friction and turbulent flow properties, when the projectile rushes through the dense Earth's atmosphere in less than 30 s. The important questions to be answered for the design of a hypersonic projectile are the determination of the duration, magnitude, and location of the maximum temperatures with respect to the projectile's surface and its corresponding internal structure. For the determination of the complicated physical conditions, a two-step approach is used. In a so-called predesign phase, the HF3T code of the DLR is applied to estimate time-dependent temperature changes on the projectile's surface and/or within the material's structure as a function of the trajectory parameters. Finally, the three-degree-of-freedom trajectory program TRAJECTORY 3D of DLR is used to generate a detailed time-dependent data set, which includes the values for projectile velocity, Mach and Reynolds numbers, and atmospheric properties as a function of altitude. This data set is exchangeable with the TAU code of DLR for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, enabling pseudo-unsteady flow solutions along the trajectory. The solutions resulting from both approaches are then compared with emphasis on the surface temperature distributions. This strategy allows the verification of the feasibility of the proposed design solution for the railgun launched hypersonic projectiles.

AB The design of a robust and fault-tolerant control system for the attitude control of a satellite launch vehicle is described. The robust controller is designed for the nominal system in order to reduce the effect of disturbances in the system. Finally, a reconfigured controller is designed to stabilise the system by placing the closed-loop poles within a desired region and also to guarantee the disturbance attenuation below a certain level. The linear matrix inequality technique is used to design the controllers. The performance of the nominal and reconfigured controller is presented.

AB Purpose - The control of weld penetration in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is required for a "teach and playback" robot to overcome the gap variation in the welding process. This paper aims to investigate this subject.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a robotic system based on the real-time vision measurement. The primary objective has been to demonstrate the feasibility of using vision-based image processing to measure the seam gap in real-time and adjust welding current and wire-feed rate to realize the penetration control during the robot-welding process.
   Findings - The paper finds that vision-based measurement of the seam gap can be used in the welding robot, in real-time, to control weld penetration. it helps the "teach and playback" robot to adjust the welding procedures according to the gap variation.
   Research limitations/implications - The system requires that the seam edges can be accurately identified using a correlation method.
   Practical implications - The system is applicable to storage tank welding of a rocket.
   Originality/value - The control algorithm based on the knowledge base has been set up for continuous GTAW. A novel visual image analysis method has been developed in the study for a welding robot.

TI Control of a cylindrical PVTOL vehicle: global non-linear velocity
   tracking control considering aerodynamics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID VTOL AIRCRAFT; STABILIZATION; SYSTEMS
AB In the following paper, a non-linear control law is designed for a three degree-of-freedom "hovering rocket''. The proposed control problem is similar to the classic planar vertical take-off and landing (PVTOL) control problem introduced by Hauser et al. (1992). However, the dynamic model of the "hovering rocket'' used for controller design includes a description of vehicle aerodynamics such that the designed controller will enable tracking at velocities where aerodynamics effects are significant. The controller design is based on an innovative extension to the published idea of using feedback to cast the system's closed-loop dynamics into a stable cascade structure; see Sepulchre et al. (1997) and Olfati-Saber (2002). Approximations to the system's aerodynamics are made to enable control design. An innovative control law is proposed that minimizes the norm of the interconnection term between closed-loop subsystems and enables trade-off between horizontal and vertical tracking performance. Global stability of this control law is proven. Simulation results demonstrate aggressive tracking performance, superiority of the improved cascade control design, and robustness of the controller to approximations necessary for controller design.

AB The requirements for the pitch-angle control of an air vehicle are a very fast response with as few vibrations as possible. The vibrations can damage the equipment that is carried within the body of the vehicle. The main problem to deal with is the relatively fast and under damped dynamics of the vehicle and the slow actuators and sensors. We have solved the problem by using a predictive approach. The main idea of this approach is a process output prediction based on a decomposed process model. The decomposition enables the extension of the model-based approach to processes with integrative behavior such as in the case of a rocket's pitch-angle control. The proposed approach is not only useful in this case but it gives us a framework to design the control for a wide range of processes. We compared the predictive design methodology with the classical compensator control approach, known from aerospace system control. The advantage of the new approach is the reduced vibrations during the transient response.

AB The low regression rates of classic hybrid rocket fuels lead to large internal ports that limit potential applications. This experimental study investigated the increase in regression rate that results from adding a solid oxidizer and a catalyst to a hybrid fuel grain. The configuration is named a "mixed hybrid" hybrid to signify solid oxidizer and catalyst in the grain. A design of experiments approach guided fuel formulation to systematically control levels of ammonium perchlorate from 25% to 30%, ferric oxide from 0 to 5%, and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene from 70% to 75%. The 1.5-in. diam. port, 12-in. long center perforated grains were burned with gaseous oxygen at pressure levels from 150 to 550 psig and port flux levels from 0.1 to 0.4 lbm/s-in.(2). The results show that the mixed hybrid propellants burn as a function of both pressure and mass flux. A grain formulation having 27.5% ammonium perchlorate and 2.5% ferric oxide provided the maximum burning rate augmentation (447%) among the formulations tested.

AB The performance of a conceptual, missile-class, hypersonic vehicle was modeled using a 2-degree-of-freedom dynamics model. The vehicle was assumed to be air launched, accelerated to a Mach number of 3 using a solid propellant rocket, and subsequently propelled using a dual-mode scramjet engine to cruise at Mach numbers between 4 and 9. Modeling results show that fuel storage capacity and dynamic pressure have a significant effect on vehicle range and average speed. A perturbation analysis was also performed that ranked the sensitivity of missile range to small changes in 14 design parameters. The kinetic energy efficiency (total pressure loss) of the scramjet has the highest effect on performance at high cruise Mach numbers (6.7-9), followed by structural mass, combustion efficiency, and aerodynamics parameters. At low cruise Mach numbers (4-6.7), structural concerns dominate performance, followed by the aerodynamics and scramjet operating parameters.

AB Multidisciplinary design optimization is an important approach for the conceptual design of space planes because these planes are characterized by disciplines that interact with one another. A multidisciplinary design optimization problem of a single-stage-to-orbit space,plane is formulated and solved in this study. The modeling and optimization of rigid body characteristics, such as trim and stability, are focused on because a single-stage-to-orbit space plane has a tendency for considerable shift of both the aerodynamic center and the center of gravity. Moreover, the design of the air'-breathing engines are integrated with the airframe and its effect on the rigid body characteristics are also modeled in the framework of multidisciplinary design optimization. Using the all-at-once-based multidisciplinary design optimization approach, which incorporates sparse nonlinear programming and metamodeling, the design of the vehicle and its flight trajectory are successfully optimized. Finally, the characteristics of the optimal solution are investigated, especially the relationships among the airframe-engine integration, rigid body characteristics, and payload transportation capability.

TI Chamber core structures for fairing acoustic mitigation

DT Article
ID LAUNCH PROTECTION EXPERIMENT; NOISE TRANSMISSION; RESONATORS
AB The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory is pursuing an innovative composite structure design called,chamber core for constructing launch vehicle payload fairings. A composite chamber core fairing consists of many axial tubes sandwiched-between face sheets, tubes that can be used as acoustic dampers to reduce low-frequency interior noise with virtually no added mass. This paper presents the results of experimental studies of noise transmission through a 1.51 in diameter 1.42 in tall chamber core cylinder. It was tested in a semireverberant acoustics laboratory using band-limited random noise at sound pressure levels up to 110 dB. The bare cylinder provided approximately 12.7 dB of attenuation over the 0-500 Hz bandwidth and 153 dB over 0-2000 Hz. The noise reduction increased to over 18 dB for both bandwidths with the axial tubes acting as acoustic dampers. Narrowband reductions in excess of 15 dB were measured around specific acoustic resonances. This was accomplished with virtually no added mass to the composite cylinder. Results were compared with the performance provided by a 2.5 cm acoustic blanket treatment. The acoustic dampers were as effective as the acoustic blanket at low frequency, but not at higher frequencies. The acoustic dampers were better able to couple with and damp the low-frequency acoustic modes. Together, the acoustic blanket and dampers provided over 10 dB more noise reduction over the 2000 Hz bandwidth than the bare cylinder.

AB In January 2002 the SIERRA sounding rocket was launched from Alaska into active substorm expansion aurora. Direct measurements of the cold ionospheric population in darkness were made by the Thermal Electron Detector (TED), which was designed to measure thermal electrons that can carry auroral currents coupling the lower ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Measurement of thermal electrons must be accompanied by a careful study of electrostatic potentials forming near conducting bodies in a plasma. The TED instrument measurements show that a nonmonotonic potential barrier can form in the sheath around the attractively biased detector and prevent measurements of the core of the thermal electrons. The TED instrument design and response are discussed along with the current balance conditions which can lead to the formation of a potential barrier. A plasma distribution reconstruction technique enables key measurements of temperature, density, spacecraft potential, and an estimate of field-aligned current flow. Observed thermal electron core temperatures vary greatly, from similar to 0.1 eV in the polar cap to similar to 0.8 eV in auroral arcs. Outside active precipitation, the electron density agrees with an independent calculation based on measurements from the high-frequency (HF) wave receiver, verifying the method used for estimating the spacecraft potential. In the auroral regions the HF measurement of electron plasma density must be used to extract more accurate results for the spacecraft potential. The thermal electron data indicate that in the dark the nonnegligible auroral and secondary emission currents must be accounted for in order to understand the spacecraft potential and its impact on thermal electron measurements.

AB We present the first results from the low-energy detector payload of the solar X-ray spectrometer (SOXS) mission, which was launched onboard the GSAT-2 Indian spacecraft on May 08, 2003 by the GSLV-D2 rocket to study solar flares. The SOXS low-energy detector (SLD) payload was designed, developed, and fabricated by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in collaboration with the Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bangalore. The SLD payload employs state-of-the-art, solid-state detectors, viz., Si PIN and Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) devices that operate at near room temperature (-20 degrees C). The energy ranges of the Si PIN and CZT detectors are 4-25 and 4-56 keV, respectively. The Si PIN provides sub-keV energy resolution, while the CZT provides similar to 1.7 keV energy resolution throughout the energy range. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy resolution of the Si PIN detector allows measuring the intensity, peak energy, and the equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV, as a function of time in all ten M-class flares studied in this investigation. The peak energy (E-p) of the Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.7 keV with increase in temperature from 9 to 58 MK. We found that the equivalent width (w) of the Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 30 MK and then increases very slowly up to 40 MK. It remains between 3.5 and 4 keV in the temperature range of 30-45 MK. We compare our measurements of w with calculations made earlier by various investigators and propose that these measurements may improve theoretical models. We interpret the variation of both E-p and w with temperature as being to the changes in the ionization and recombination conditions in the plasma during the flare, and as a consequence, the contribution from different ionic emission lines also varies.

AB The U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Tier I male pubertal protocol was designed as a screen to detect endocrine-disrupting chemicals which may alter reproductive development or thyroid function. One purpose of this in vivo screening protocol is to detect thyrotoxicants via a number of different mechanisms of action, such as thyroid hormone synthesis or clearance. Here we evaluate the ability of this EDSP male pubertal protocol to detect the known thyrotoxicant ammonium perchlorate as an endocrine disruptor. Ammonium perchlorate is a primary ingredient in rocket fuel, fertilizers, paints, and lubricants. Over the past 50 years, potassium perchlorate has been used to treat hyperthyroidism in humans. Perchlorate alters thyroid hormone secretion by competitively inhibiting iodide uptake by the thyroid gland. In this study, ammonium perchlorate was administered at 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg to male Wistar rats based on a pilot study of oral dosing. Doses of 125-500 mg/kg perchlorate decreased T4 in a dose-dependent manner. TSH was significantly increased in a dose-responsive manner at the same doses, while T3 was unchanged at any dose. Thyroid histology was significantly altered at all doses, even at the 62.5 mg/kg, with a clear dose-dependent decrease in colloid area and increase in follicular cell height. No effects on preputial separation, a marker of pubertal progression, or reproductive tract development were observed at any dose. These results demonstrate that the male pubertal protocol is useful for detecting thyrotoxicants which target the thyroid axis by this mechanism (altered uptake of iodide). This study also found that perchlorate exposure during this period did not alter any of the reproductive developmental endpoints. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new, novel test method, associated analysis, and experimental procedures are developed to investigate the toughness of the facesheet-to-core interface of a sandwich material at cryogenic temperatures. The test method is designed to simulate the failure mode associated with facesheet debonding due to high levels of gas pressure in the honeycomb core. The effects of specimen orientation are considered, and the results of toughness measurements are presented. Comparisons are made between room and cryogenic test temperatures. It was determined that the test method is insensitive to specimen facesheet orientation and strain energy release rate increases with a decrease in the test temperature. A reasonable agreement between test and simulation was achieved at both temperatures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An analysis of plasma behavior in a magnetic nozzle would be very useful for designing plasma propulsion systems using a laser fusion. We examine by using a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid code how a thrust vector varies with changing positions of the fusion explosion (off-axis explosion) for the one-coil system of a laser fusion rocket. Furthermore, we investigate plasma behaviors and the thrust efficiency, and optimize the thrust efficiency by changing the current and the position of a rear coil for two-coil system. We also discuss the possibility of control techniques of the thrust vector for a two-coil system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB The Phoenix vehicle was designed to flight demonstrate the automatic and unpowered horizontal landing of a representative, winged reusable launch vehicle. The shape of the test vehicle was derived from the suborbital reusable launch vehicle concept Hopper. Three automatic landing tests were completed successfully in May 2004. Methods of system identification were applied to the. flight data to evaluate the performance and to improve the design models and databases for future applications. A specific emphasis was placed on the evaluation of the onboard navigation system, air data sensor, aerodynamic model, landing gear effects and ground-roll characteristics. This paper gives a brief overview of the Phoenix mission and elaborates on the flight data analysis and of the preceding wind-tunnel campaigns, to allow a comparison of results from different approaches.

AB The nation's goals to replace the aging Space Shuttle fleet and pursue exploration of our solar system and beyond will require more robust, less costly launch vehicles and spacecraft. This paper presents a novel sliding mode control approach, sliding mode control driven by sliding mode disturbance observers with gain adaptation, for a reusable launch vehicle flight control system design as a way to improve robustness to many phenomena such as modeling uncertainties and disturbances, while retaining continuity of control without using high control gains. Because of the robustness to external disturbances and modeling uncertainties, the proposed flight control system design also can reduce cost by requiring less time in design cycle and preflight analyses. This design is applied to terminal area energy management and approach/landing. The multiple-loop flight controller design features low-order disturbance observers that rely only on knowledge of the bounds of the disturbance. A gain-adaptation algorithm is included in the disturbance observer design that provides the least gain needed for existence of the sliding mode. Six degree-of-freedom computer simulations of the X-33 technology demonstration suborbital reusable launch vehicle for nominal and severe wind-gust tests demonstrate improved performance over a more conventional, classical control system design.

AB In this paper a new algorithm of trajectory tracking based on closest radius solution of the interval equations system is proposed. The design procedure is given and applied to the pitch angle control of unmanned testing rocket with uncertain parameters. The proposed algorithm gives a framework to design a control for a wide range of different linear time-invariant processes with uncertain parameters and can be implemented also in the case of non-convex problems. The algorithm gives the analytical way of finding the nearly optimal solution of model reference trajectory tracking in the case of general time-invariant systems with uncertain parameters and can be used when optimization method fails due to the complexity of the problem.

AB Three multilevel multidisciplinary optimization techniques, Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, Collaborative Optimization, and Modified Collaborative Optimization, are applied to the design of a reusable launch vehicle, evaluated, and compared in this study. In addition to comparing the techniques against each other, they are also compared with designs reached via fixed-point iteration of disciplines with local optimization and the industry accepted multidisciplinary optimization technique, All-at-Once. The new multidisciplinary optimization techniques, particularly Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, showed greater ability than fixed-point iteration to design for a global objective and were more applicable to complex systems than All-at-Once. This study was the first time that the novel multidisciplinary optimization methods were compared qualitatively and quantitatively under controlled experimentation practices. It is still impossible to statistically determine whether any one of the novel multidisciplinary optimization techniques is better than another, because more studies using different test problems corroborating the conclusions made here are needed.

AB A model of a small-scale water rocket is developed as an example of open-system modelling by both a bond graph approach and a more classical method. In addition to the formulation and bond graph development, a goal of the research is to determine the benefits of the bond graph approach into affording an insight into the system dynamics. Both modelling approaches yield equivalent differential equations, as they should, while the bond graph approach yields significantly more insight into the system dynamics. If a modelling goal is to simply find the system equations and predict behaviour, the classical approach may be more expeditious. If insight and ease of model modification are desired, the bond graph technique is probably the better choice.

AB The future of enhanced missile systems hinges on the development of significant innovative improvements in the manufacturing of composite solid rocket motor casings. Current manufacturing of composite motors is extremely laborious. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) has developed a novel rotomolding, technology to significantly adjust the cost-versus-performance tradeoff for composite solid rocket motors (SRM). The approach involves full development of a novel rotomold process technology to manufacture SRM in a much less expensive manner while allowing for improved performance insulation designs. The rotomold process will result in low-cost pre-insulated leave-in-mandrels. These mandrels will be inserted into the traditional filament winding manufacturing process currently used to manufacture SRM. This approach will eliminate more than 50% of the manufacturing labor. Additional benefits exist in the capability to customize insulation designs as needed to improve performance. This paper presents the progress made in this research, including discussions on the development of the rotomolding process, demonstration of feasibility, process characterization, and future plans.

AB This paper describes an effort in which the design of an entire missile system consisting of a ramjet powered sustainer and an associated solid rocket booster is considered. The design process is controlled by a genetic algorithm optimizer which directs and controls other system performance prediction codes. The optimizer used in the present process is the IMPROVE (c) code, a genetic algorithm (GA) with many advanced features including a pareto option and nicheing. The paper contains limited discussion of the methodology and shows results for several design scenarios. The results are to be interpreted as a "proof of concept" effort and are not directed toward a specific design problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present an engineering assessment of a proposal for a deployment brake for a momentum exchange tether. Tethers have attracted considerable interest amongst the propulsion community for many years for orbit raising, energy conversion, de-orbiting, and injection into interplanetary transfers, and the motivation for the work described in the paper is directly mission-oriented. The YES2 SpaceMail mission has been planned as a low-cost international effort to provide a facility for the return of small samples from the ISS back to Earth, based on an inflatable re-entry capsule and a mechanical tether system. The system will be lofted into orbit as part of a payload on a Foton/Bion rocket launcher. The brake design concept is based on the use of friction between the deploying tether and a short pole onto which several turns are wound, and the paper summarises the modelling work that has been done, and then discusses an experiment in which the premise was tested in the laboratory. The paper concludes with certain practical proposals for implementation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In November 1994 and August 1997 the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (CRISTA) instrument performed a global measurement (72 degrees S-72 degrees N) of infrared limb radiance from 4 to 71 mu m in the altitude range 6-180 km. Using a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) model that couples the collisional, radiative and photochemical processes, the kinetic temperature was recovered from 15 mu m CO2 emission for CRISTA-1 and -2 missions by direct assimilation of the integrated limb radiances between 72 and 120 km. Falling sphere and airglow validation measurements at NASA/GSFC Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and the Mesosphere-Thermosphere Emissions for Ozone Remote Sensing (METEORS) experiment at White Sands Missile Range were coordinated with CRISTA during the field campaign. The derived temperatures show good agreement with these rocket soundings, partial climatology obtained from Rayleigh scattering observations by Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and NRLMSISE-00 model.

AB Internal flow modeling is a requisite for obtaining critical parameters in the design and fabrication of modern solid rocket motors. In this work, the analytical formulation of internal flows particular to motors with tapered sidewalls is pursued. The analysis employs the vorticity-streamfunction approach to treat this problem assuming steady, incompressible, inviscid, and nonreactive flow conditions. The resulting solution is rotational following the analyses presented by Culick for a cylindrical motor. In an extension to Culick's work, Clayton has recently managed to incorporate the effect of tapered walls. Here, an approach similar to that of Clayton is applied to a slab motor in which the chamber is modeled as a rectangular channel with tapered sidewalls. The solutions are shown to be reducible, at leading order, to Taylor's inviscid profile in a porous channel. The analysis also captures the generation of vorticity at the surface of the propellant and its transport along the streamlines. It is from the axial pressure gradient that the proper form of the vorticity is ascertained. Regular perturbations are then used to solve the vorticity equation that prescribes the mean flow motion. Subsequently, numerical simulations via a finite volume solver are carried out to gain further confidence in the analytical approximations. In illustrating the effects of the taper on flow conditions, comparisons of total pressure and velocity profiles in tapered and nontapered chambers are entertained. Finally, a comparison with the axisymmetric flow analog is presented. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

AB The overall sizing of launch vehicles is of interest, especially when air-breathing is also included. The sizing of a launch vehicle is dictated by the State of Art technologies present and the need to match the challenging demands of high-payload fraction, low cost, and also ensure reliability. This paper presents some of the important design requirements. An ideal velocity approach, which assumes various velocity losses, is generally followed for initial vehicle sizing. However, as this approach is approximate and sometimes incorrect, a new concept of accounting the drag and thrust losses during the atmospheric phase for conventional rockets and air-breathing launch vehicles using scramjet propulsion is evolved complementing the ideal velocity sizing approach. A simplistic two-dimensional trajectory simulation program with graphics for quick interactive design was developed for this purpose. The air-breathing launch vehicle trajectory is split into three flight phases. The sizing of the vehicle considering, especially, the intermediate air-breathing regime is also dealt with. A method to determine the maximum-load envelope expressed in terms of the product of flight dynamic pressure and angle of attack, namely Q-alpha, for all weather launches useful for initial design purposes is also suggested. The design program meant for initial design sizing purposes gives a quick insight on the vehicle performance prior to detailed design with minimum basic vehicle data for conventional rockets and also for air-breathing scramjet vehicles. The various design factors, such as optimum velocity requirement for two stage to orbit vehicles and the sizing requirement of the orbital stage after end of air-breathing phase, are also discussed through representative typical values highlighting the design sensitivities.

AB With a time resolution of 0.125 s and a spectral resolution of 4 cm(-1), emission spectra of the combustion process of a solid propellant were recorded by highly time-resolved passive FTIR. Some gaseous combustion products, such as H2O, CO, CO2, NO and HCl, were distinguished by the characteristic emission band of each molecule. The equation for flame temperature calculation based on the diatomic molecule emission fine structure theory was improved through judicious utilization of the spectral running number 'm' which makes the temperature measurement simpler and faster. Some combustion information of the solid propellant had been given including the characteristic spectral profile, the distribution of the absolute spectral energy, the distribution of the combustion flame temperature, and the concentration distributions of HCl and NO versus burning time. The results will provide theoretical and experimental bases for improving the formula and raising combustion efficiency of solid propellant, and developing the design of rocket motor, infrared guidance and antiguidance systems.

AB [ 1] On 25 March 2003, Horizontal E-Region Experiment (HEX) released trimethyl aluminum trails from two rockets launched northward from Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks to map the vertical wind field near a stable premidnight auroral arc system. They deployed three trails of trimethyl aluminum chemical "puffs,'' whose subsequent motion traced the prevailing wind field. This motion was determined using triangulation from four ground observation sites. Position and speed accuracies were estimated to be similar to 1 km and a few meters per second, respectively. The first rocket followed a novel flat trajectory; it released a nearly horizontal trail of length 200 km, at an average altitude of similar to 145 km. The second rocket was launched 19 min later and released two trails between 125 and 175 km altitude along a conventional steep trajectory. All puffs between 130 and 175 km altitude drifted geomagnetic westward, almost exactly parallel to the aurora. From prior observations and modeling, we had expected to observe convective upwelling near the arcs. We did not; vertical winds were essentially downward throughout the horizontal trail, with speeds between 0 and 20 m s(-1). Although an abatement of downward flow was observed similar to 40 km equatorward of the arcs, these data alone do not establish a causal relationship between the abatement and the arcs. Vertical speeds of <= 20 m s(-1) are relatively modest. However, because the observed wind field would entrain air parcels in flow parallel to the arc system, even vertical speeds around 15 m s(-1) could displace individual air parcels by several scale heights if they occurred all along the arcs.

AB Introduction: Ejection injury has been documented with respect to non-rocket-assisted seats, but there is little information on injuries associated with rocket-assisted seats. This study analyses the survivability of military accidents and the injuries associated with rocket-assisted ejection. Methods: A total of 232 Royal Air Force accident reports were accessed and aircrews' injuries were related to the aircraft parameters of ejection, aircrew anthropometry, and the ejection seat and parachute dynamics. Ejection sequences were simulated using a computerized modeling tool to provide information relating to the dynamic response index, acceleration of the ejection seats, and performance of the parachutes. Results: Ejection survival was 89.2% overall, 95.7% for within envelope ejections and 23.8% for out of envelope ejections. There were 29.4% of aircrew who sustained spinal fractures. Another 14.2% of aircrew sustained a head injury and the incidence of head injury in Tornado ejectees was higher than the other aircraft types. Compared with 5.8% of ejectees from aircraft with an arm restraint system, 11.2% of aircrew sustained upper limb flail injuries from ejecting from aircraft without an arm restraint system. Arm flail injuries occurred at a higher aircraft speed at ejection compared with ejections where no arm flail injuries were sustained. There was also 18% of aircrew who sustained lower limb parachute landing injuries. Discussion: Information from this study has lead to a redesign of the Tornado ejection seat headbox, an improvement in the Tornado ejection catapult dynamics, an upgrade of escape system parachutes, and provided evidence that future aircraft should be fitted with an arm restraint system.

ID REGRESSION RATE BEHAVIOR; MOTORS
AB This paper analyzes the results obtained from a series of static firings of a lab-scaled hybrid rocket in which gaseous oxygen Was supplied into axial-symmetric polyethylene cylindrical grains through two different injector configurations: an axial conical subsonic nozzle and a radial injector. The axial injector is interesting because of its relatively easy design, the higher regression rates, and the noticeably stable motor operation. To exploit, its qualities, not only the assessment of the regression rate but rather the entire behavior of the motor is required. For the investigated set of operating conditions, the instantaneous regression rates exhibit a time dependence caused by the impinging jet zone dynamics, while the average regression rates a re higher and less mass flux dependent than those achieved with the radial injection motor and expected from the classical turbulent-boundary-layer diffusion-limited theory. A comparison to the data from the radial injector was further drawn in terms of combustion efficiency and fuel regression uniformity. Concerning combustion stability, some observations are made. The radial injector, at the same mass flux and pressure, produces lower regression rates, high pressure oscillations, and worse combustion efficiency, but more uniform fuel consumption.

AB Systems analyses were performed for a Titan Explorer Mission characterized by Earth-Saturn transfer stages using solar electric power generation and propulsion systems for primary interplanetary propulsion, as well as chemical propulsion for capture at Titan. An examination of a range of system factors was performed to determine their effect on the payload delivery capability to Titan. The effect of varying launch vehicle,type, solar array power level, ion thruster number, specific impulse, trip time, and Titan capture stage chemical propellant choice was investigated. The major purpose was to demonstrate the efficacy of applying advanced ion propulsion system technologies like NASA's evolutionary xenon thruster (NEXT), coupled with state-of-the-art (SOA) and advanced chemical technologies to a Flagship class mission. This study demonstrated that a NASA design reference mission (DRM) payload of 406 kg could be successfully delivered to Titan using the baseline advanced ion propulsion system in conjunction with SOA chemical propulsion for Titan capture. In addition, the solar electric propulsion system (SEPS)/chemical system of this study is compared to an all-chemical NASA DRM. Results showed that the NEXT-based SEPS/chemical system was able to deliver the required payload to Titan in 5 years less transfer time and on a smaller launch vehicle than the SOA chemical option.

AB In the recent design and testing of the upgraded detonator used in the Titan IVB explosive bolt for jettison of expended strap-on solid rocket motors, it was determined that the 25-kV, 500 pF, pin-to-case electrostatic discharge test without the traditional 5-k Omega series resistor is a destructive test. After this test, pin-to-case insulation resistance in the detonator measured under the traditional 500 V could fail the 2-M Omega minimum requirement. An extensive investigation established a relationship between three phenomena: the electrostatic discharge, the insulation resistance, and the pin-to-case breakdown voltage. Several screening techniques were developed and verified. Parameters and designs for eliminating or reducing the failure were identified for future design of electroexplosive devices.

AB A specially-designed sounding rocket experiment with a bare, conducting tether was recently suggested to test an idea that tether-produced energetic-electron beams can be used for remote sensing the neutral density in the E region. This letter contains the theoretical analysis of collisionless beam-plasma interactions (BPI) that complement direct impact of the energetic electrons with neutral particles. Collisionless effects are shown to play a significant and even major role in tether-induced aurora (TA). In the F region, BPI lead to appreciable green-line (557.7 nm) emissions at similar to 200 km. Farther downward, BPI develop inside a local minimum in the plasma density between the E and F regions, the so-called valley. Here a thin layer of a strongly-elevated electron temperature and airglow is predicted. Neutralizing electric currents carried by ionospheric electrons can become unstable in the low-density valley. As a result, developing plasma waves inhibit the currents. In the extreme case, the beam might be locked (a 'virtual cathode'). In addition to optical observations, these effects can also be observed by radio frequency methods.

AB A two-dimensional axisymmetric viscous flow analysis of a rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engine inlet is performed using a time-marching numerical scheme to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The flow configuration is a subscale model of the engine inlet which was previously tested in the 1X1 supersonic wind tunnel at NASA Glenn Research Center. The computed results are compared with the experimental data which include static pressure profiles along the centerbody and the cowl surface of the inlet. The computational results show a reasonably good agreement with the experimental data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To send humans beyond Mars, a Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE) mission has been studied for new spacecraft concepts and technologies. In this paper, an interplanetary trajectory and a preliminary spacecraft design are presented for the HOPE visit to Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons. To design a round-trip trajectory for the mission, the characteristics of the spacecraft and its trajectories are analyzed. A detailed optimization approach is formulated to utilize a Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) engine with capabilities of variable specific impulse, variable engine efficiency, and engine on-off control. It is mainly illustrated that a 30 MW powered spacecraft can make the mission possible in a 5-year round trip constraint around the year 2045. Trajectories with different power and reactor options are also discussed. The results obtained in this study can be used for formulating an overall concept for the mission.

TI Leader/return-stroke-like processes in the initial stage of
   rocket-triggered lightning
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
LA English
DT Article
AB [ 1] Linear streak film, video, current, and electric field records from nine triggered-lightning flashes are analyzed to examine the process of cutoff and reestablishment of current during the initial stage of rocket-triggered lightning. All of the data were acquired at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding, Florida, in 2002 and 2003. It is shown that in some rocket-triggered lightning events, the process of current cutoff and reestablishment during the initial stage is similar to a leader/return-stroke sequence, although the currents in this process are typically an order of magnitude smaller ( 1 kA or so) than those in a triggered or natural lightning subsequent stroke ( 10 - 15 kA). The events were separated into two groups based on observed characteristics, with the duration of the current cutoff interval being the primary differentiating characteristic. In some cases, two or three failed attempts at current reestablishment prior to the successful resumption of current flow in the channel were observed. Currents associated with the unsuccessful attempts were typically an order of magnitude smaller ( 100 A or so) than in the process which finally reestablished the current.

AB Sounding rocket programs for upper atmospheric research (UAR) commenced at Woomera in 1957, with the British Skylark project and the Anglo-Australian HARP rockoon program. Shortly afterwards, the Weapons Research Establishment (WRE) inaugurated its own sounding rocket program with the first successful Australian-built sounding rocket, Long Tom, developed from surplus British motors. This research would eventually lead to the development of Australia's first satellite, WRESAT, launched in 1967.
   Long Tom became the first more than 10 Australian designed and built sounding rockets that would be employed at Woomera until the demise of the WRE upper atmosphere program in 1976, as the Range was winding down to the cessation of the Anglo-Australian Joint Project. Like Long Tom, most of the early Australian sounding rockets were constructed by the WRE from surplus British motors, but after 1967 the later vehicles had a much higher local content, based on combinations of British motors and/or rocket motors developed in Australia. These new motors were named after constellations of the southern sky, while the rockets themselves bore the names of Australian native birds.
   This paper will outline the technical and scientific history of the Australian sounding rocket program, examining its origins and the reasons for its demise. It will look at the sequential development of the various Australian rockets and consider the particular research projects with which they were associated, the relationship with the WRESAT project and the move to Australian production after 1967.

AB By introducing various innovative ideas, the difficult-to-develop small hybrid-type rocket is successfully developed. The main purpose is to drastically reduce the cost of rocket experiments and thus, attract potential users such as metrological and microgravity researchers. A key idea is a new fuel grain design to accelerate the gasification rate of solid fuel. The new fuel grain design, designated as CAMUI as an abbreviation of "cascaded multistage impinging-jet", is that the gas flow repeatedly collides with the solid fuel surface to accelerate the heat transfer to the fuel. To install a regenerative cooling system using cryogenic liquid oxygen as coolant in a small launcher, the authors devised a valveless supply system (with no valves in the liquid oxygen flow line). Four serial successful launch verification tests by 10kg vehicle equipped with a 50kgf thrust CAMUI motor have shown the feasibility of the motor system. The meteorological observation model of 400kgf class motor is under development and the development of microgravity experiment class of 1.5-2tonf motor will follow subsequently. The authors plan to complete the development of the 400kgf class motor for meteorological observation model by the end of FY2005. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aerojet used the patented thrust augmented nozzle (TAN) concept to validate a unique means of increasing sea-level thrust in a liquid rocket booster engine. We have used knowledge gained from hypersonic Scramjet research to inject propellants into the supersonic region of the rocket engine nozzle to significantly increase sea-level thrust without significantly impacting specific impulse. The TAN concept overcomes conventional engine limitations by injecting propellants and combusting in an annular region in the divergent section of the nozzle. This injection of propellants at moderate pressures. allows for obtaining high thrust at takeoff without overexpansion thrust losses. The main chamber is operated at a constant pressure while maintaining a constant head rise and flow rate of the main propellant pumps. Recent hot-fire tests have validated the design approach and thrust augmentation ratios. Calculations of nozzle performance and wall pressures were made using computational fluid dynamics analyses with and without thrust augmentation flow, resulting in good agreement between calculated and measured quantities including augmentation thrust. This paper describes the TAN concept, the test setup, test results, and calculation results. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Design of heat treatment cycle for hardness improvement of
   Cu-9Al-6Ni-5Fe alloy
SO CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Aluminum bronze (Cu-9Al-6Ni-5Fe) is used in the axial piston pump of launch vehicle systems worldwide. Abrasion resistance / hardness is one of the major requirements of the material. Heat treatment cycles have been studied experimentally to improve the hardness of the alloy. The hardness of the Cu-Al-Ni-Fe quaternary alloy is found to be higher in various heat treated conditions due to the formation of the martensite phase during solution treatment and due to the precipitation of the K phase in the alloy subsequently during tempering. Higher temperature tempering resulted in a lowering of the hardness which is attributed to the presence of the platelet K phase. Accordingly, desirable heat treatment parameters can be selected as required.

TI Failure mechanisms and deployment accuracy of elastic-memory composites
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Elastic-memory composites (EMCs) is a class of polymeric composites that can be folded into a very compact shape and later deployed to the original shape upon reheating. They have significant potential in developing large deployable structures greater than 10 m in size that can be stowed in a small launch vehicle and deployed in space to predetermined levels of precision. Generally, the composite is folded by heating it above the glass transition temperature of the resin. The primary deformation mode that allows EMCs to achieve significantly higher effective strains than traditional composites is microbuckling of the compressed fibers. The magnitude of this microbuckling dictates whether the laminate behaves elastically or if the laminate exhibits material failure such as fiber breakage, or fiber kinking. This paper explores the micromechanics of both types of fiber-deformation modes associated with the bending of such soft-resin composites. An analysis method is developed and correlated with experimental data to provide an estimate for the level of folding strain that a soft-resin laminate can achieve based on microbuckling-induced material failure. Additionally, insight is provided into the effects of fiber and matrix material properties on the formation and magnitude of the kink mode. Tests were also conducted to determine the deployment accuracy after a number of folding/deployment cycles to help design deployable sensor structures with these materials.

AB An active diagnostic system using built-in piezoelectric actuator/sensor networks was developed for monitoring crack growth in a rocket engine pipe. The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A(0) mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S-0 mode in plates) to crack growth.

AB A single Al0.5Ga0.5As/GaAs V-grooved quantum wire modified by selective ion implantation and rapid thermal annealing was investigated by using spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy and magneto-resistance measurements. The results of spatially resolved photoluminescence indicate that the ion-implantation-induced quantum well intermixing significantly raises the electronic sub-band energies in the side quantum wells (SQWs) and vertical quantum wells, and a more efficient accumulation of electrons in the quantum wires is achieved. Processes of real space carrier transfer from the SQW to the quantum wire was experimentally observed, and showed the blocking effect of carrier transfer due to the existence of the necking quantum well region. Furthermore, magneto-transport investigation on the ion-implanted quantum wire samples shows the quasi-one-dimensional intrinsic motion of electrons, which is important for the design and the optimization of one-dimensional electronic devices.

AB An analytical optimization and evaluation approach is presented for sizing a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen, single-stage-to-orbit system. The approach uses a unique merging of historical data for weight relationships, Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty analysis, technology factors, thermochemical analysis, and genetic algorithm solvers for concept optimization. The. method models and optimizes engine chamber pressure, area ratio, and oxidizer/fuel ratio to determine the best vehicle design based on seven separate cost/weight figures of merit Model results show that a 53% increase in design, development, test, and evaluation cost results in a 67% reduction in gross liftoff weight. The uncertainty range for the design, development, test, and evaluation costs is shown to be from -45 to +76% of the mean value for the 95th percentile uncertainty case. The oxidizer/fuel ratio has a significant impact on the overall weight of the vehicle and vehicle components due to the large percentage of the gross liftoff weight that is dedicated to propellants. Other results show the effects of propulsion parameters, technology factors, and cost factors on weight and cost under different overall design constraints.

AB The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has recently been developed to simulate homogeneous water condensation in a free expansion rocket plume. A nucleation rate, based on the classical nucleation theory (CNT), was used in the DSMC simulation to predict initial nuclei in the condensation region. However, recent experimental research suggests that the CNT nucleation rate should be corrected and the magnitude of the, correction is a function of the vapor temperature. Because the nucleation rate is one of the most important factors that impacts the accuracy of the numerical simulation results for a condensation plume, the impact is investigated of the corrected nucleation rate on cluster growth processes and flow macroparameters in an expanding flow using the DSMC method to model both the gas and condensate flow.

AB Piles socketed into rock are often used to support heavy loads from buildings and infrastructure. Piles typically of up to 1.8 m diameter carrying safe working loads of up to 40 MN are utilised in Australia. Their design has traditionally been based on conservative, empirical rules. GARSP (Golder Associates Rocket field Socket Procedure) is a recent design innovation that provides a serviceability approach to design, and allows socket lengths to be optimised during the drilling process, often resulting in significant savings. It also provides better control of the risks associated with unexpected ground conditions and with construction of the pile. GARSP has been used in collaboration with Wagstaff Piling on several large-scale socketed pile projects in Melbourne, Australia, including the second hotel for Crown Casino, the new grandstand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the redevelopment of Spencer Street Station, and several residential towers. The adoption of this approach for these projects in conjunction with best practice construction techniques has resulted in significant cost savings in terms both of materials and of construction time. This paper briefly describes the traditional design approaches and the basic components of GARSP, and then presents some recent projects where it has been used.

TI Improvements in the measurement of distillation curves. 2. Application
   to aerospace/aviation fuels RP-1 and s-8
SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous paper, a number of improvements in the method and apparatus used for the measurement of distillation curves for complex hydrocarbon fluid mixtures were presented. These improvements included the addition of a composition-explicit channel of data, improved temperature control and measurement, and improved and less uncertain volume measurement. In this paper, we demonstrate the improved approach with application to two complex hydrocarbon fluids, rocket propellant 1 (RP-1) and a synthetic JP-8 that is designated as S-8. RP-1 is a long-established hydrocarbon fuel that continues to be widely used since it was first developed in the 1950s. Modern versions of this fluid are produced from a narrow-range kerosene fraction that is processed to reduce unsaturated compounds and also sulfur-containing hydrocarbons. S-8 is a synthetic substitute for fluids such as JP-8 and Jet-A. It is produced with the Fischer Tropsch process from natural gas. As these new and reformulated fluids gain increasing application, especially in aviation/aerospace application, it will be increasingly important to have material characterization test procedures that are reproducible and that have a sound and fundamental basis. This will allow modeling of the properties and guide further refinement of the fluids.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents a new design methodology for efficient conceptual design of complex systems involving multidisciplinary and computationally intensive analysis with large number of design variables. A nearly-orthogonal sampling of design space is proposed with good space filling properties to extract maximum useful information about system behavior using much lower number of trial designs. This sampled data is then used as training data for artificial neural network, which will act as a metamodel to represent the time consuming disciplinary analyses. A stage-wise interconnection of separate neural networks is also proposed for trajectory metamodel to offset dimensionality curse of neural networks. Genetic Algorithm performs global optimization by utilizing this metamodel and subsequently sequential quadratic programming performs the local optimization utilizing exact analyses. The performance of proposed methodology is investigated in this paper for the conceptual design optimization of multistage solid fueled space launch vehicle. The results show excellent approximation of highly non-linear functions using proposed sampling and drastic reduction in overall design optimization time, due to greatly reduced number of exact disciplinary analyses.

AB We present the first results from the 'Low Energy Detector' payload of 'Solar X-ray- Spectrometer (SOXS)' mission, which was launched onboard GSAT-2 Indian spacecraft on 08 May 2003 by GSLV-D2 rocket to study the solar flares. The SOXS Low Energy Detector (SLD) payload was designed, developed and fabricated by Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in collaboration with Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bangalore of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The SLD payload employs the state-of-the-art solid state detectors viz., Si PIN and Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) devices that operate at near room temperature (-20 degrees C). The dynamic energy range of Si PIN and CZT detectors are 4-25 keV and 4-56 keV respectively. The Si PIN provides sub-keV energy resolution while CZT reveals similar to 1.7 keV energy resolution throughout the dynamic range. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy resolution of Si PIN detector allows the measuring of the intensity, peak energy and equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV as a function of time in all 8 M-class flares studied in this investigation. The peak energy (E-p) of Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.8 keV with increase in temperature from 9 to 34 MK. We found that the equivalent width (w) of Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 20 MK but later it increases very slowly up to 28 MK and then it remains uniform around 1.55 keV up to 34 MK. We compare our measurements of w with calculations made earlier by various investigators and propose that these measurements may improve theoretical models. We interpret the variation of both E-p and w with temperature as the changes in the ionization and recombination conditions in the plasma during the flare interval and as a consequence the contribution from different ionic emission lines also varies.

AB The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is a high-power propulsion concept using radio waves to create and accelerate plasma in a magnetic nozzle. Important features are its high and variable exhaust velocity, which greatly enhances performance. A NASA-led, research team is developing this technology in the U.S. Recent advances include demonstration of efficient propellant utilization in its helicon plasma source and experimental verification of high ion acceleration through ion cyclotron wave resonance absorption, as predicted by theory. This paper describes the physics and engineering of VASIMR, reviews recent progress and discusses its application in a piloted Mars mission architecture. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB While scientists have a responsibility to defer judgment in the absence of conclusive data, public health and ecological protection require that government regulators make decisions based on available information. The risk assessment paradigm has evolved to help risk managers balance risks to public health with the cost of pollution control and remediation. Risk assessments are designed to be reasonably protective of public health, however the time and money required to develop and evaluate a robust scientific database can significantly delay regulatory action while exposures continue. The federal assessment of perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel and a thyroid toxicant, is presented here as a case study that demonstrates some of the limitations of risk assessment in protecting public health. Perchlorate was detected in a city well field that lies beneath a military training range at Aberdeen Proving Ground, a U.S. Army garrison in Maryland. Cleanup was put on hold, pending promulgation of a national drinking water standard for perchlorate. This case study (1) illustrates the challenge of preventing chemical exposures in the absence of promulgated standards, and (2) makes recommendations for approaches to preventing exposures to chemicals of unknown, or uncertain toxicity before they occur.

TI Baseline design of new horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The New Horizons mission is progressing toward its planned launch in January 2006. Current plans call for the New Horizons spacecraft to be launched by a newly developed evolved expendable launch vehicle (FELV) Atlas V 551 with the STAR 48B kick stage in January/February 2006. After flying for more than 32AU and traveling through the inner and outer solar system, the spacecraft is expected to arrive at Pluto as early as July 2015 for the first scientific reconnaissance investigations of the last planet that has not yet been visited by a spacecraft. This paper describes the baseline mission design, which includes the baseline launch scenario that maximizes the launch probability with an extensive launch period of 35 days, the interplanetary trajectory design that allows the spacecraft to fly fast to Pluto by taking advantage of the gravity assist from Jupiter, the trajectory design of the close encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon, and the mission plan for the extended mission beyond Pluto to fly by a Kuiper belt object. Note: New Horizons is NASA's planned mission to Pluto and has not been approved for launch. All representations in this paper are contingent on a decision by NASA to go forward with the preparation for and launch of the mission. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a systematic formulation for the simulation of rigid body dynamics, including the short period dynamics, inherent to stage separation and jettisoning parts of a satellite launcher. This also gives a review of various types of separations involved in a launch vehicle. The problem is sufficiently large and complex; the methodology involves iterations at successively lower levels of abstraction. The best choice to tackle such problems is to use state-of-the-art programming technique known as object oriented programming. The necessary classes have been identified to represent various entities in the launch vehicle separation process (e.g., gravity, aerodynamics, propulsion and separation mechanisms etc.). Simple linkages are modelled with suitable objects. This approach helps the designer to simulate a launch vehicle separation dynamics and also to analyse separation system performance. To examine the influence of the design variables on the separating bodies, statistical analyses have been performed on the upper stage separation process and pull out of ongoing stage nozzle from the spent stage of a multistage rocket carrier using retro rockets.

TI Flight testing of a new Earth-to-orbit air-launch method
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
AB This paper describes the development and flight testing ora new air-launch method for safely launching personnel and cargo into low Earth orbit (LEO). A new rocket is also being designed that will be,carried by and launched using the new air-launch method from a modified 747 airliner. This new air-launch method, called trapeze-lanyard air drop (t/LAD) launch, will greatly improve simplicity, safety, cost, and reliability of launching personnel into LEO. A t/LAD launch eliminates the need for wings or fins on the launch vehicle; greatly reduces ascent,dynamic pressure, sideways accelerations and bending forces, and rocket engine thrust vectoring control; and allows the use of a simple and very safe vapor pressurization (Vapak) engine cycle for the launch vehicle. This paper reports on the flight-test results of dropping three,23%-scale drop test articles using,the t/LAD launch method.

TI Analysis of disturbances in a leg of pitch-up maneuvering
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEMS SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB A complex model of disturbances for a leg of pitch-up maneuvering by a carrier aircraft in launching a launch vehicle was constructed. The model incorporates the atmospheric disturbances (wind gust, jet wind, and density variations), errors in the motion parameters at the point of beginning the maneuver, and the deviation of the initial mass of a launcher aircraft from the design mass. Such a model is required for a priori estimation of the operational requirements (in normal load factor and attack angle), as well as for determination of possible initial errors in the motion of the launch vehicle due to the air launch. We present majority estimates of errors for the most unfavorable combination of disturbances and the results of statistical analysis for the disturbed-motion trajectories by the Monte Carlo method.

AB A new approach to the design of a kinetic-kill longitudinal autopilot steering the missile trajectory by the combination of aerodynamic lift and divert thrusters (dual-thrusters control) and with its attitude oriented by attitude thrusters is presented. The proposed approach may increase the total divert acceleration capability by up to 100%, improving the end-game intercept accuracy, when such capability is required. The pitch plane autopilot design is based on second-order sliding mode control using a nonlinear dynamic sliding manifold technique. A robust high-accuracy tracking of the missile normal acceleration guidance command is achieved in the presence of considerable model uncertainties created by the interactions between the airflow and the thrusters jets. Results of the computer simulation demonstrate excellent, robust, high-accuracy tracking performance of the proposed design.

AB Under cold-flow and atmospheric ambient pressure conditions, the breakup characteristics of liquid sheets formed by a like-doublet injector were investigated. The sheet breakup wavelength, which induces the sheet to be broken into ligaments, and the sheet breakup length, which is important for finding the flame location, were measured using stroboscopic light. After sheet breakup, liquid ligaments are formed intermittently, and their wavelengths are believed to be related to the combustion instability of liquid-rocket engine. Therefore, the wavelength and the breakup length. of ligaments broken into fine drops were also measured. Because these spray characteristics are affected by the flow characteristics of the two liquid jets before they impinge on each other, the focus was on the effects of orifice internal flow, such as the cavitation phenomenon that occurs inside a sharp-edged orifice. From the experimental results, it was found that liquid jet turbulence delays sheet breakup and shortens the wavelengths of both sheets and ligaments. Because the turbulence strength of a sharp-edged orifice is stronger than that of a round-edged orifice, the shape of orifice entrance gives large differences in the spray characteristics. With these results, empirical models of the spray characteristics of a like-doublet injector were proposed, and these models can provide useful and practical data for use in designing liquid-rocket combustors.

AB A conceptual design study was performed to assess and compare the parameters of two-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch-vehicle systems in an effort to identify optimal configurations for improved access to space. The following vehicle configuration categories were considered: horizontal takeoff ramjet-scramjet boosters with upper-stage reusable rockets, horizontal takeoff turbine boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages, and vertical takeoff rocket boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages. Ramjet-scramjet upper stages utilize integrated rockets for final orbital ascent. Ramjet-scramjet booster stages make use of either integrated turbines or rockets for takeoff and acceleration to ramjet start. The payload requirement for each vehicle system is 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile low Earth orbit. The vehicle solutions were-evaluated utilizing several figures of merit including empty weight, wetted area, actively cooled area, gross weight, staging considerations, and design and technology traceability to future development of single-stage-to-orbit hypersonic airbreathing vehicles. The application of these criteria to the closed vehicle solutions reveals that the vertically launched rocket booster with an upper-stage ramjet-scramjet is the best two-stage airbreathing launch vehicle configuration. Of all of the two-stage vehicles investigated, those which place the hypersonic propulsion elements as part of the upper stage surpass those with first-stage placement and exhibit more design traceability with single-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch vehicles.

ID REVERSED-FIELD PINCH; PERFORMANCE
AB We report the first application of a superconductive transition edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeter to a thermonuclear fusion plasma experiment in the toroidal pinch experiment RX (TPE-RX). The TES microcalorimeter was installed in a portable adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR), which is originally designed for a rocket experiment. The ADR was directly connected to TPE-RX with a vacuum duct, and thin Toray-Lumirror or parylene films were used for entrance windows to allow soft X-rays coming into the detector with good efficiency. The detector box was designed to shield the strong magnetic field produced by ADR and TPE-RX. A total of 3472 counts of X-ray signals were detected in 0.2-3.0 keV for 210 plasma shots during the flat-top phase (35-70 ms) after discarding pile-up events. Combining the data with that measured in the energy range of 1.3-8 keV using a SiLi detector, we examined a wide band X-ray spectrum of the plasma. The obtained spectrum is dominated by thermal plasma emission, although at least four different temperature components are required to account for the whole band spectral shape. Impurities in the deuterium plasma are also investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DE optimization; launcher; trajectory
AB Launcher trajectory optimization is a complex task, especially when considering the specific problems arising in the study of reusable launch vehicles. Part of the difficulty comes from the different characteristics of the trajectory arcs which make up the vehicle's mission (constraints and controls may not be the same). Another difficulty is the necessity, in some cases, of a global optimization between ascent and re-entry phases (branching optimisation). Finally, optimization tools devoted to this task should be polyvalent and robust, as the studies of reusable launch vehicles usually cover many different concepts, and also many different trajectory cases (such as abort scenarios). The purpose of this paper is to present different approaches used in France by CNES and ONERA to solve optimal control problems in the context of launcher trajectory optimization. These approaches, which are powerful implementations of classical optimization methods, were designed to cover the needs for both expendable and reusable launchers trajectory calculation. The first optimization tool presented is OPTAX, which uses an indirect shooting method. The second and third tools presented are CNES's ORAGE and ONERNs FLOP/OLGA, which use two different variants of the gradient method. The paper describes the equations and methodology behind these tools, and also presents their advantages and drawbacks. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In a companion liquid rocket engine development project, due to the overall weight constraint of the propulsion system, a cavitating venturi is selected to control the liquid fuel and liquid oxidizer mass flow rates. Two cavitating venturis, one for the fuel and the other for the oxidizer, are designed to deliver the desired mass flow rates for a specified operating inlet pressure, temperature, and inlet cross-sectional area. The converging and diverging angles of the venturis are selected from the literature for minimum pressure losses. An experimental setup is designed to verify that the cavitating venturis can deliver the specified flow rates. Two different techniques are used to pressurize the system: in the first method, pressurized nitrogen as is used, and in the second method, high pressure combustion gases generated from a solid propellant gas generator are used. Transient mass flow rates could not be measured using standard methods due to the short duration of the water tests; instead, average mass flow rates are calculated. The results verify that the designed cavitating venturis can indeed provide the desired mass flow rates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Structural ceramics are considered as potential candidate materials for use in hybrid bearings in rocket turbopumps, operated under high stress in cryogenic environment. The friction and wear-related surface failure is considered as one of the critical factors in selecting the materials for cryo-turbopumps of Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). To obtain fundamental understanding of the tribological properties of ceramics in cryogenic environment, a very first set of sliding wear tests were carried out on self-mated Al2O3, a model brittle ceramic material, in liquid nitrogen (LN2) under varying load (2-10 N) and high rotational speed of 2550 rpm, using a newly designed cryogenic tribometer. The present research attempts to answer some important questions: (i) What would be the influence of LN2 on frictional and fracture behavior at sliding contacts? (ii) How does the material removal process occur in LN2 environment? Our experimental results reveal that self-mated alumina exhibits low steady-state coefficient of friction similar to 0. 13-0.18 and suffers from high wear rate (10(-5) mm(3)/Nm) under the selected testing conditions. The novelty of the present work also lies in presenting some interesting results, for the first time, concerning the deformation and fracture of alumina at cryogenic temperature under high speed sliding conditions. Detailed scanning electronic microscope observation of the worn surfaces indicates that severe damage of both ball and flat occurs in cryogenic environment by transgranular and intergranular fracture. The observed wear behavior is explained in terms of thermal heat dissipation and brittle fracture of alumina in LN2.

The present research attempts to answer some important questions: (i) What would be the influence of LN2 on frictional and fracture behavior at sliding contacts? (ii) How does the material removal process occur in LN2 environment? Our experimental results reveal that self-mated alumina exhibits low steady-state coefficient of friction similar to 0. 13-0.18 and suffers from high wear rate (10(-5) mm(3)/Nm) under the selected testing conditions. The novelty of the present work also lies in presenting some interesting results, for the first time, concerning the deformation and fracture of alumina at cryogenic temperature under high speed sliding conditions. Detailed scanning electronic microscope observation of the worn surfaces indicates that severe damage of both ball and flat occurs in cryogenic environment by transgranular and intergranular fracture. The observed wear behavior is explained in terms of thermal heat dissipation and brittle fracture of alumina in LN2.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Space transportation system conceptual design is a multi disciplinary process containing considerable element of risk. Uncertainties from one engineering discipline may propagate to another through linking parameters and the final system output may have an accumulation of risk. This may lead to significant deviations from expected performance. An estimate of variability or design risk therefore becomes essential for a robust design. This study utilizes the dual response surface approach to quantify variability in critical performance characteristics during conceptual design phase of a launch vehicle. Using design of experiments methods and disciplinary design analysis codes, dual response surfaces are constructed for the mean and standard deviation to quantify variability in vehicle weight and sizing analysis. Next, an optimum solution is sought to minimize variability subject to a constraint on mean weight. In this application, the dual response surface approach lead to quantifying and minimizing variability without much increase in design effort. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Despun rocket borne imager: Design aspects of a space based optical
   imaging instrument for auroral studies
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Imaging the aurora from space is scientifically rewarding since understanding the fluctuations in conjunction with other parameters measured along the magnetic field line of interest can resolve ambiguities regarding the nature of the emissions as well as provide a context for the emissions. Typical payloads launched on sounding rockets for auroral studies are spin stabilized, which imply that standard imaging techniques cannot be used due to severe blurring. The despun rocket borne imager is a simple instrumentation concept that uses a Dove prism to counter the rotation effects of the spinning platform and thus produce images without blurring. This technique has been applied to two instruments flown on sounding rockets with varying optical properties needed to address specific scientific queries. This article discusses the design of both of these instruments and includes the necessary considerations for a generic instrument for future projects. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

AB A superconductive transition edge sensor (TES) calorimeter is for the first time applied for the diagnostics of the reversed field pinch plasma produced in the toroidal pinch experiment RX (TPE-RX), and the instrumental system is fully described. The first result from the soft x-ray spectroscopy in 0.2-3 keV with an energy resolution similar to 50 eV are also presented. The TES calorimeter is made of a thin bilayer film of titanium and gold with a transition temperature of 151 mK and its best energy resolution at our laboratory is 6.4 eV, while it was significantly degraded by about a factor of eight during the plasma operation. The TES microcalorimeter was installed in a portable adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR), which is originally designed for a rocket experiment. The detector box is carefully designed to shield the strong magnetic field produced by the ADR and TPE-RX. The ADR was directly connected to TPE-RX with a vacuum duct in the sideway configuration, and cooled down to 125 mK stabilized with an accuracy of 10 mu K rms using an improved proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control method. Thin aluminized Toray Lumirror or Parylene-N films were used for the IR to UV blocking filters of the incident x-ray window to allow soft x-rays coming into the detector with good efficiency. TPE-RX was operated with the plasma current of I-p=220 kA, and the wave forms of the TES output for every plasma shot lasting similar to 80 ms were obtained with a digital oscilloscope. The wave forms were analyzed with the optimal filtering method, and x-ray signals were extracted. A total of 3472 counts of x-ray signals were detected for 210 plasma shots during the flat-top phase of t=35-70 ms. Combined with the data measured with a lithium drifted silicon detector in the 1.3-8 keV range, spectral features are investigated using a spectral fitting package XSPEC. The obtained spectrum is well explained by thermal plasma emission, although an impurity iron-L line emissions at variously ionized states are dominant around 0.7-1.2 keV. At least three different temperature components ranging T=350-900 eV are required to account for the spectral shape, while the average temperature is consistent with the ruby laser Thomson scattering measurement.

AB The origin of the transition of the flow structure between free shock separation and restricted shock separation in a compressed truncated perfect nozzle is studied. A three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes solver is used to capture the nonaxisymmetric unsteady flow structure inside the nozzle. The transition is numerically reproduced under the experimental condition where the transition occurs. Until now, the transition has been numerically observed in a thrust optimized nozzle, a parabolic nozzle, and a highly compressed truncated perfect nozzle, where an internal shock generated from the nozzle throat is the characteristic. However, in the compressed truncated perfect nozzle studied here the internal shock is weak and cannot be detected by the well-known shock function. Therefore, a function is used to detect the compression and expansion and it is found that a low-expansion region exists inside the compressed truncated perfect nozzle. The transition is likely to occur when this region is broadened radially at a mixture ratio lower than the design value.

AB This paper presents an approach to space transportation turnaround operations modeling using knowledge based complexity functions. This project is of significant relevance to the field of industrial engineering as it deals with knowledge based estimation of processing operations based on the design characteristics of an extremely complex product. The modeling approach uses expert's knowledge to predict the ground cycle time and costs of a new concept launch vehicle by functions that estimate the complexity and reliability of the system based on its design characteristics. The operational requirements include the interactions between the launch vehicle and its ground infrastructure: the spaceport. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the modeling concept into a tool called Architecture Assessment Tool - enhanced (AATe) used by NASA and its contractors.
   Significance: It is imperative that space transportation systems be analyzed in the very earliest of design to ensure all life cycle costs are considered. This paper presents an approach to the operational cost and time modeling of these systems by knowledge based complexity functions and the importance of this assessment using the concept of total design.

TI UXO time-constant estimation from helicopter-borne TEM data
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING GEOPHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB We have developed a new helicopter-borne transient electromagnetic system, known as ORAGS-TEM, which was designed for the detection of unexploded ordnance (UXO) through very low attitude measurements. This system has already achieved considerable success in demonstrations over prepared test grids and a bombing site at the former Badlands Bombing Range (BBR) in South Dakota. UXO ranging in size from 113 kg (250 lb) bombs to 60 mm illumination shells and 7 cm (2.75 in) rocket components were detected by both magnetometer and transient electromagnetic technologies during these trials, conducted in September, 2002. The signal/noise ratio (SNR) observed in TEM measurements during these trials was high, prompting us to ask, "What degree of UXO discrimination can be achieved through detailed analysis of this airborne TEM dataset?" Given the degree of spatial averaging and sampling limitations imposed by the system's flight height and speed, we felt that a very detailed analysis of the type performed by Pasion and Oldenburg would not be practical. Instead, we developed an improved transient analysis technique based on the Matrix Pencil Method to improve the accuracy of exponential decomposition of the observed transients. Where target SNR values of 10 or higher were present this method yielded repeatable results that reliably distinguished compact, long-time-constant targets such as bombs and artillery shells from short-time-constant targets Such as thin-walled scrap from practice bombs. As system sensitivity and resolution continues to improve, we expect that similar target discrimination methods will become standard data analysis tools.

AB The Jet Propulsion Laboratory Autonomous Helicopter Testbed (AHT), an aerial robot based upon a radio-controlled model helicopter, provides a small low-cost platform for developing and field testing new technologies needed for future space missions. The AHT helps cover the test space in a complementary fashion to other methods, such as rocket sleds or parachute drops. The AHT design and implementation is presented as well as experimental results and milestones achieved since its creation in 2001. In addition, technologies we are developing and testing are described. These include image-based hazard detection and avoidance algorithms for safe landing in dangerous terrain and an extended Kalman filter that augments inertial navigation with image-based motion estimates to enable pin-point landing.

AB The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) recognizes the importance of the current space debris scenario, and the impact it has on the effective utilization of space technology for the improvement in the quality of life on the Earth. ISRO is committed to effective management of the threats due to space debris. Towards this commitment ISRO works on different aspects of space debris, including the debris mitigation measures. This paper highlights the activities and achievements in the implementation of the mitigation measures. ISRO successfully designed and developed a propellant venting system for implementation in the existing upper stage of India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which uses Earth-storable liquid propellants. GSLV also employs passivation of the Cryogenic Upper Stage at the end of its useful mission. ISRO's communication satellites in GSO are designed with adequate propellant margins for re-orbiting at the end of their useful life to a higher graveyard orbit. A typical successful operation in connection with INSAT-2C is described. ISRO developed its debris environmental models and software to predict the close approach of any of the debris to the functional satellites. The software are regularly used for the debris risk management of the orbiting spacecraft and launch vehicles. ISRO recognizes the role of international cooperation in the debris mitigation measures and actively contributes to the efforts of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS).

TI Long-term/strategic scenario for reusable booster stages
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the final design status of a partially reusable space transportation system which has been under study for five years within the German future launcher technology research program ASTRA. It consists of dual booster stages, which are attached to an advanced expendable core. The design of the reference liquid fly-back boosters (LFBB) is focused on LOX/LH2 propellant and a future advanced gas-generator cycle rocket motor. The preliminary design study was performed in close cooperation between DLR and the German space industry. The paper's first part describes recent progress in the design of this reusable booster stage.
   The second part of the paper assesses a long-term, strategic scenario of the reusable stage's operation. The general idea is the gradual evolution of the above mentioned basic fly-back booster vehicle into three space transportation systems performing different tasks: Reusable First Stage for a small launcher application, successive development to a fully reusable TSTO, and booster for a super-heavy-lift rocket to support an ambitious space flight program like manned Mars missions. The assessment addresses questions of technical sanity, preliminary sizing and performance issues and, where applicable, examines alternative options. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Long-term/strategic scenario for reusable booster stages
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the final design status of a partially reusable space transportation system which has been under study for five years within the German future launcher technology research program ASTRA. It consists of dual booster stages, which are attached to an advanced expendable core. The design of the reference liquid fly-back boosters (LFBB) is focused on LOX/LH2 propellant and a future advanced gas-generator cycle rocket motor. The preliminary design study was performed in close cooperation between DLR and the German space industry. The paper's first part describes recent progress in the design of this reusable booster stage.
   The second part of the paper assesses a long-term, strategic scenario of the reusable stage's operation. The general idea is the gradual evolution of the above mentioned basic fly-back booster vehicle into three space transportation systems performing different tasks: Reusable First Stage for a small launcher application, successive development to a fully reusable TSTO, and booster for a super-heavy-lift rocket to support an ambitious space flight program like manned Mars missions. The assessment addresses questions of technical sanity, preliminary sizing and performance issues and, where applicable, examines alternative options. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews the history of cryogenic fluid management technology development and infusion into both the Saturn and Centaur vehicles. Ground testing and analysis proved inadequate to demonstrate full scale performance. As a consequence flight demonstration with full scale vehicle was required by both the Saturn and Centaur programs to build confidence that problems were addressed. However; the flight vehicles were highly limited on flight instrumentation and the flight demonstration "locked-in" the design without challenging the function of design elements. Projects reviewed include: the Aerobee Sounding Rocket Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) tests which served as a valuable stepping stone to flight demonstration and built confidence in the ability to handle hydrogen in low gravity; the Saturn IVB Fluid Management Qualification flight test; the Atlas Centaur demonstration flights to develop two burn capability; and finally the Titan Centaur two post mission flight tests.

AB Sub-cooling of cryogenic propellant by helium injection is one of the most effective methods for suppressing bulk boiling and keeping sub-cooled liquid oxygen before rocket launch. In order to design the cooling system, understanding of the limitations of heat and mass transfer is required. In this paper, an analytical model for the helium injection system is presented. This model's main feature is the representation of bubbling system using finite-rate heat transfer and instantaneous mass transfer concept. With this simplified approach, the effect of helium injection to liquid oxygen system under several circumstances is examined. Experimental results along with simulations of single bubble rising in liquid oxygen and bubbling system are presented with various helium injection flow rates, helium temperatures, and injection methods. The overall cooling effect for rocket application is also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Rescuing a stranded satellite in space - Experimental robotic capture of
   non-cooperative satellites

DT Article
DE space robot; on-orbit service; satellite capture; visual servoing
AB Increased space activity has frequently caused satellites to enter the wrong orbits for their missions and become stranded due to rocket failure. Therefore, a rescue system is needed to tow them back to their appropriate orbits. Manipulator capture using visual servoing is one of the most promising ways to capture a stranded satellite with no mechanical interface or visual marker. A study is being conducted to design a manipulator-based capturing system that focuses on the final tracking and capturing of non-cooperative targets and allows for special aspects, such as lighting and available computing power in space. This paper presents the results of our experiments and an explanation of the system.

AB Nitrate content is an important quality characteristic of vegetables. Vegetable nitrate content is of interest to governments and regulators owing to the possible implications for health and to check that controls on the content are effective. Nitrate itself is relatively non-toxic but its metabolites may produce a number of health effects. Until recently nitrate was perceived as a purely harmful dietary component which causes infantile methaemoglobinaemia, carcinogenesis and possibly even teratogenesis. Recent research studies suggest that nitrate is actually a key part of our bodies' defences against gastroenteritis. In this review are reported: (1) vegetable classification as a function of nitrate accumulation; (2) vegetable contribution to the total dietary exposure of nitrate; (3) European Commission Regulation No. 563/2002 which sets limits for nitrate in lettuce and spinach; (4) the maximum levels set in some countries for beetroot, cabbage, carrot, celery, endive, Lamb's lettuce, potato, radish and rocket; (5) the results of surveys on the nitrate content of vegetables in Italy and other European countries.

AB In order to evaluate the tribological properties of ball bearings used in high-speed cryo-turbopumps of liquid rocket engines, a tribometer to operate at high sliding speed in cryogenic environment is required. In order to meet the above requirements, a new high-speed cryo-tribometer has been designed. With this new tribometer, the evaluation of friction and wear mechanisms of various self-mated materials and solid lubricant coatings under high sliding speeds (> 0.5-45 m/s) with high Hertzian contact stresses (up to 2.5 GPa) in cryogenic fluid is now possible. Two additional features available with this new cryo-tribometer are: (a) a mono-ball rolling-on-disk tester under the above conditions for the analysis of rolling friction and (b) the testing of unlubricated and lubricated ball bearing (10 mm diameter bore) submerged in liquid nitrogen or liquid helium under very high-speed (36,000 rpm). An additional provision has been made for the continuous measurement of bearing frictional torque at a maximum axial load of 50N. The design details of the new tribometer are the major focus of discussion in this paper. This paper also reports the results of a very first set of experiments conducted on self-mated 440C steel and AISI 304 steel under liquid nitrogen (LN2) immersed condition with selected testing parameters. Testing of ball bearings with Pb-IP coating at 36,000 rpm under liquid nitrogen also has been carried out. Additionally, the wear mechanisms for self-mated steel in cryogenic liquid are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are classic autoantibodies commonly found in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by dryness of the eyes and mouth. The autoantibodies recognize a RING-finger protein, Ro52, whose function is still unknown. Since many RING-finger proteins have been identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases, this study was designed to determine whether Ro52 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. For this purpose, recombinant Ro52 was purified from bacterial lysate and used to investigate its activity of E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. Its enzymatic activity was also tested in HEK293T cells using wild-type Ro52 and its RING-finger mutant. Our results indicated that Ro52 ubiquitinates itself in cooperation with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5B, thereby validating that Ro52 is a RING-finger-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. Importantly, this ubiquitin modification is predominantly monoubiquitination, which does not target Ro52 to the proteasome for degradation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MaCWAVE (Mountain and Convective Waves Ascending VErtically) was a highly coordinated rocket, ground-based, and satellite program designed to address gravity wave forcing of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The MaCWAVE program was conducted at the Norwegian Andoya Rocket Range (ARR, 69.3 degrees N) in July 2002, and continued at the Swedish Rocket Range (Esrange, 67.9 degrees N) during January 2003. Correlative instrumentation included the ALOMAR MF and MST radars and RMR and Na lidars, Esrange MST and meteor radars and RMR lidar, radiosondes, and TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) satellite measurements of thermal structures. The data have been used to define both the mean fields and the wave field structures and turbulence acneration leading to forcing of the large-scale flow. In summer, launch sequences coupled with ground-based measurements at ARR addressed the forcing of the summer mesopause environment by anticipated convective and shear generated gravity waves. These motions were measured with two 12-h rocket sequences, each involving one Terrier-Orion payload accompanied by a mix of MET rockets, all at ARR in Norway. The MET rockets were used to define the temperature and wind structure of the stratosphere and mesosphere. The Terrier-Orions were designed to measure small-scale plasma fluctuations and turbulence that might be induced by wave breaking in the mesosphere. For the summer series, three European MIDAS (Middle Atmosphere Dynamics and Structure) rockets were also launched from ARR in coordination with the MaCWAVE payloads. These were designed to measure plasma and neutral turbulence within the MLT. The summer program exhibited a number of indications of significant departures of the mean wind and temperature structures from "normal" polar summer conditions, including an unusually warm mesopause and a slowing of the formation of polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) and noctilucent clouds (NLC). This was suggested to be due to enhanced planetary wave activity in the Southern Hemisphere and a surprising degree of interhemispheric coupling. The winter program was designed to study the upward propagation and penetration of mountain waves from northern Scandinavia into the MLT at a site favored for such penetration. As the major response was expected to be downstream (east) of Norway, these motions were measured with similar rocket sequences to those used in the summer campaign, but this time at Esrange. However, a major polar stratospheric warming just prior to the rocket launch window induced small or reversed stratospheric zonal winds, which prevented mountain wave penetration into the mesosphere. Instead, mountain waves encountered critical levels at lower altitudes and the observed wave structure in the mesosphere originated from other sources. For example, a large-amplitude semidiurnal tide was observed in the mesosphere on 28 and 29 January, and appears to have contributed to significant instability and small-scale structures at higher altitudes. The resulting energy deposition was found to be competitive with summertime values. Hence, our MaCWAVE measurements as a whole are the first to characterize influences in the MLT region of planetary wave activity and related stratospheric warmings during both winter and summer.

AB Sounding rocket experiments were conducted during the NASA EQUIS II campaign on Kwajalein Atoll designed to elucidate the electrodynamics and layer structure of the postsunset equatorial F region ionosphere prior to the onset of equatorial spread F (ESF). Experiments took place on 7 and 15 August 2004, each comprised of the launch of an instrumented and two chemical release sounding rockets. The instrumented rockets measured plasma number density, vector electric fields, and other parameters to an apogee of about 450 km. The chemical release rockets deployed trails of trimethyl aluminum (TMA) which yielded wind profile measurements. The Altair radar was used to monitor coherent and incoherent scatter in UHF and VHF bands. Electron density profiles were also measured with rocket beacons and an ionosonde. Strong plasma shear flow was evident in both experiments. Bottom-type scattering layers were observed mainly in the valley region, below the shear nodes, in westward-drifting plasma strata. The layers were likely produced by wind-driven interchange instabilities as proposed by Kudeki and Bhattacharyya (1999). In both experiments, the layers were patchy and distributed periodically in space. Their horizontal structure was similar to that of the large-scale plasma depletions that formed later at higher altitude during ESF conditions. We argue that the bottom-type layers were modulated by the same large-scale waves that seeded the ESF. A scenario where the large-scale waves were themselves produced by collisional shear instabilities is described.

AB This paper summarizes and compares the results of systematic research programs at two independent laboratories regarding the injection of cryogenic liquids at subcritical and supercritical pressures, with application to liquid rocket engines. Both single jets and coaxial jets have been studied. Cold flow studies provided valuable information without introducing the complexities of combustion. Initial studies utilized a single jet of cryogenic nitrogen injected into a quiescent room temperature nitrogen environment with pressures below and above the thermodynamic critical pressure of the nitrogen. Later, the work was extended to investigate the effects of a co-flowing gas. Parallel to this work, combustion studies with cryogenic propellants were introduced to understand high pressure coaxial injection phenomena with the influence of chemical reaction. Shadowgraphy and spontaneous Raman scattering were used to measure quantities such as growth rates, core lengths, turbulent length scales, fractal dimensions, and jet breakup regimes. It is found that jets injected at supercritical pressures do not atomize as they do at subcritical pressures. Rather, they behave in many respects like variable density turbulent gas jets.

AB A detailed understanding of liquid propellant combustion is necessary for the development of improved and more reliable propulsion systems. This article describes experimental investigations aimed at providing such a fundamental basis for design and engineering of combustion components. It reports recent applications of imaging techniques to cryogenic combustion at high pressure. The flame structure is investigated in the transcritical range where the pressure exceeds the critical pressure of oxygen (p > p(c)(O-2 = 5.04 MPa)) but the temperature of the injected liquid oxygen is below its critical value (T-O2 < T-c(O-2) = 154K. Data obtained from imaging of OH* radicals emission, CH* radicals emission in the case of LOx/GCH(4) flames and backlighting provide a detailed view of the flame structure for a set of injection conditions. The data may be used to guide numerical modelling of transcritical flames and the theoretical and numerical analysis of the stabilization process. Calculations of the flame edge are used to illustrate this aspect. Results obtained may also be employed to devise engineering modelling tools and methodologies for component development aimed at improved efficiency and augmented reliability.

AB This paper provides an overview of recent advances in the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of cryogenic fluid injection and mixing in transcritical and supercritical environments. The basis of the analysis is a general theoretical and numerical framework that accommodates full conservation laws and real-fluid thermodynamic and transport phenomena. All of the thermophysical properties are determined directly from fundamental thermodynamics theories, along with the use of corresponding-state principles. Turbulence closure is achieved using a large-eddy-simulation technique, in which large-scale motions are calculated explicitly and the effects of unresolved small-scale turbulence are modeled either analytically or empirically. The analysis has been applied to study: (1) fluid jet dynamics, (2) swirl injection of liquid oxygen through a simplex swirl injector, and (3) shear co-axial injection and mixing of liquid oxygen and methane. Various effects, including density stratification, shear-layer instability, volume dilatation, and property variations, dictating the evolution of cryogenic jets and mixing layers, are identified and analyzed in depth. The jet dynamics are found to be largely determined by the local thermodynamic state through its influence on the thermophysical properties of the fluid. The impact of injector configuration and operating conditions on the swirl injector behavior are also highlighted. These results not only shed light on the subject problems, but also provide a quantitative basis for identifying the design parameters and flow variables that exert the strongest influence on the underlying processes.

AB In this paper, a selected list of emerging applications of supercritical fluids (SCFs) are presented. In particular, demonstrated facts for the promise of the nanoscale science and technology and its overlap or interface with the SCFs technology are presented. It is argued that nanoengineered materials at the nanoscale have mechanical, optical, chemical, and electrical properties quite different from the bulk material. Examples of enhanced performance of many such materials when they are used in practical applications are given. SCFs, in particular carbon dioxide, on account of their special properties such as zero surface tension, low viscosity, and high solubility, enable them to play a critical role in many advanced technology applications. For example, as miniaturization efforts approach the nanoscale, surface tension forces become an important factor in many nanotechnology processes such as lithography in the electronic industry. In particular, the zero-surface-tension property of the SCFs presents them as a natural choice for nanotechnology processes. Cases are presented where SCF technology could enhance the advancement of nanotechnology or when the two technologies could have synergistic contributions to the synthesis and design of new materials and possibilities are presented. For example, advances in nanoscience and supercritical fluids have contributed to a better design and understanding of the composition, size, and structure of catalysts, crystals, sol - gels, and composite material performance.

AB A numerical analysis is made of the supersonic separation of air-launching rocket from the mother plane. Three-dimensional Enter equations have been numerically solved to capture details of steady/unsteady flow fields and transient behavior of the launching rocket during separation stage. Various types of interaction between shock and expansion waves are clarified with concomitant effects on the separation process. As extracting important design factors, which have major influences on the stability of separation, a guideline on the design of supersonic air-launching rocket is given.

AB Launch vehicle projects now depend on software, more than ever before, to ensure safety and efficiency. Such critical software systems, which can lead to injury, destruction or loss of vital equipment, human lives, and damage to environment, must be developed and verified with high level of quality and reliability. An overview of current quality practices pursued in launch vehicle projects is presented in this paper. These practices have played a vital role in the successful launch vehicle missions of Indian Space Research Organisation. As complexity of software increases, the activity that gets affected is nothing but, software quality assurance (SQA). The SQA team is facing a lot of challenges in current practices. This paper brings out such challenges in different phases of software life cycle. A set of key points to some techniques and tools, that could contribute to meet the software quality assurance challenges in launch vehicle projects, are also discussed.

AB This paper reports on properties of energetic electrons observed by the Auroral Particle Detector (APD) on board the sounding rocket S-310-35, which was launched from Andoya Rocket Range, Norway, at 0033:00 UT on 13 December 2004 during the DELTA campaign. The APD was designed to measure energy spectra of energetic electrons in the range of 3.5 to 65 keV every 10 ms using avalanche photodiodes. The measurement was done at altitudes of 90-140 km (apogee height of the rocket flight), which corresponded to the collisional interaction region of precipitating electrons with the atmospheric constituents. The overall profile of energetic electron precipitations was consistent with auroral images taken from the ground. The downward fluxes almost always exceeded those of upward electrons, and the ratio of downward to upward fluxes increased with energy and also with altitude. This is reasonably understood in terms of the effect of collisions between the energetic electrons and the atmospheric constituents. An interesting feature in energy spectra of precipitating electrons is the existence of non-thermal electrons at higher energies, regardless of inside or outside of auroral arcs. In order to predict the incident downward spectra at the top of the atmosphere, we have applied an analytic method of Luhmann (1976) to evaluate the collisional effect on the electron spectra. As a result, most of the observed energy spectra of precipitating electrons are well expressed by kappa distributions with the thermal energy of a few hundreds of eV and kappa of 5-8, while the spectrum inside a strong arc is better fitted by the sum of a Maxwellian distribution on the lower energy side and a power law at higher energies. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct and reliable measurement of energy spectra of electrons in the 10-keV energy range in the auroral ionosphere.

AB Purpose - To find the optimal number of channels of rocket engine thrust chamber, it was found that the optimal channel number is 335, at which the cooling effect of the thrust chamber cooling channel reaches the best, which can be helpful to design rocket engine thrust chamber.
   Design/methodology/approach - The commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT with standard k-epsilon; turbulent model was used. The CFD method was validated via comparing with the available experimental data.
   Findings - It was found that both the highest temperature and the maximal heat flux through the wall on the hot-gas side occurs about the throat region at the symmetrical center of the cooling channel. Owing to the strong curvature of the cooling channel geometry, the secondary flow reached its strongest level around the throat region. The typical values of pressure drop and temperature difference between the inlet and exit of cooling channel were 2.7 MPa and 67.38 K (standard case), respectively. Besides an optimal number of channels exist, and it is approximately 335, which can make the effect of heat transfer of cooling channels best with acceptable pressure drop. As a whole, the present study gives some useful information to the thermal design of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber.
   Research limitations/implications - More detailed computation and optimization should be performed for the fluid flow and heat transfer of cooling channel.
   Practical implications - A very useful optimization on heat transfer and fluid flow in cooling channel of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber.
   Originality/value - This paper provides the performance of optimization on heat transfer and fluid flow in cooling channel of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber, which can make the effect of heat transfer of cooling channels best with acceptable pressure drop. As a whole, the present study gives some useful information to the thermal design of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber.

AB Multiphysics simulations are playing an increasingly important role in computational science and engineering for applications ranging from aircraft design to medical treatments. These simulations require integration of techniques and tools from multiple disciplines, and in turn demand new advanced technologies to integrate independently developed physics solvers effectively. In this paper, we describe some numerical, geometrical, and system software components required by such integration, with a concrete case study of detailed, three-dimensional, parallel rocket simulations involving system-level interactions among fluid, solid, and combustion, as well as subsystem-level interactions. We package these components into a software framework that provides common-refinement based methods for transferring data between potentially non-matching meshes, novel and robust face-offsetting methods for tracking Lagrangian surface meshes, as well as integrated support for parallel mesh optimization, remeshing, algebraic manipulations, performance monitoring, and high-level data management and I/O. From these general, reusable framework components we construct domain-specific building blocks to facilitate integration of parallel, multiphysics simulations from high-level specifications that are easy to read and can also be visualized graphically. These reusable building blocks are integrated with independently developed physics codes to perform various multiphysics simulations.

AB A multi-objective synthesis problem involving H(2), H(infinity) and impluse-to-peak performances is investigated. In general, multi-objective control problems are hard problems to solve and do not have exact solutions. Here, am LMI formulation is proposed for the mixed H(2)/impulse-to-peak optimization under and H(infinity) constraint for LTI discrete-time systems. This framework is then used to control the attitude of a space launcher. A particular control structure is defined and a multi-objective H(2)/H(infinity)/impuse-to-peak synthesis problem is solved to tackle specific specifications. A systematic synthesis procedure including the tuning of design parameters is defined and results from simulations are presented.

AB A closed hydroponic system (Porous Tube Plant Nutrient Delivery System) combined with a horizontal uniaxial clinostat has been designed and built-up to grown leafy vegetables under simulated microgravity conditions. Two research activities were carried out to investigate the effects of clinorotation on growth, yield, and quality of rocket seedlings (Eruca saliva Mill.) and lettuce plants (Lactuca saliva L.), which may constitute a source of health), fresh food for the astronauts during space missions. The percentage of germination of rocket was affected by clinorotation with the highest value observed in the control treatment. The seedling fresh weight of the control treatment, was 19 % higher compared to that of the clinorotation treatment while the opposite trend was observed for chlorophyll a/b ratio. Clinorotation did not influence the quality (total carbohydrates, triglycerides, carotenoids and vitamin C) of the rocket seedlings. Shoot fresh and dry weight, leaf area, specific leaf dry weight, root dry weight and shoot:root ratio were lower in the clinorotated lettuce plants than those grown in the control treatment. Quality parameters (chlorophyll, total carbohydrates and vitamin C) of lettuce plants were negatively affected by clinorotation. Lettuce genotype comparison under simulated microgravity showed that 'Mortadella di primavera' should be adopted for space experiments due to the better growth and productivity.

AB Extensive research in recent years has demonstrated that "at rest" annihilation of antiprotons in the uranium isotope U-238 leads to fission at nearly 100% efficiency. The resulting highly-ionizing, energetic fission fragments can heat a suitable medium to very high temperatures, making such a process particularly suitable for space propulsion applications. Such an ionized medium, which would serve as a propellant, can be confined by a magnetic field during the heating process, and subsequently ejected through a magnetic nozzle to generate thrust. The gasdynamic mirror (GDM) magnetic configuration is especially suited for this application since the underlying confinement principle is that the plasma be of such density and temperature as to make the ion-ion collision mean free path shorter than the plasma length. Under these conditions the plasma behaves like a fluid, and its escape from the system is analogous to the flow of a gas into vacuum from a vessel with a hole. For the system we propose we envisage radially injecting atomic or U-238 plasma beam at a pre-determined position and axially pulsing an antiproton beam which upon interaction with the uranium target gives rise to near isotropic ejection of fission fragments with a total mass of 212 amu and total energy of about 160 MeV These particles, along with the annihilation products (i.e. pions and muons) will heat the background U-238 gas - inserted into the chamber just prior to the release of the antiproton - to one keV temperature. Preliminary analysis reveals that such a propulsion system can produce a specific impulse of about 3000 seconds at a thrust of about 50 kN. When applied to a round trip Mars mission, we find that such a journey can be accomplished in about 142 days with 2 days of thrusting and requiring only one gram of antiprotons to achieve it.

AB in a magnetized plasma, assuming an effective collision cross section by an equivalent number of neutral dust particles, the Hall (sigma(H)) and the Pederson (sigma(P)) conductivities are obtained. The Cowling conductivities (cc) are calculated using the measured values of electron densities in the ionospheric E-region heights between 90 and 120 km by the rocket flights over Thumba, India, and the neutral density model calculations as given by the MSIS-E-90 for the geographical latitude = 0 degrees, and longitude = 80 degrees. The conductivity profiles are compared with the observed profiles on the rocket flights. We see that the height difference between conductivity maxima and current density maxima can be reduced and matched by assuming a height distribution of neutral dust particles in the ionosphere. The justifications for the present modeling, i.e., the equatorial electrojet conductivities including the dust particles and comparison with the alternative theory given by Ronchi et al. [1990. Journal of Geophysical Research 95, 189] are given at the end. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The trend of miniaturization has been applied to the research of rockets to develop prototypes of micro rockets. In this paper, the development of a web-integrated prototyping system for three-dimensional micro rockets, and the results of combustion tests are discussed. The body of rocket was made of 6061 aluminum cylinder by lathe process. The three-dimensional micro nozzles were fabricated oil the same aluminum by using micro endmills with phi 100 mu m similar to phi 500 mu m diameter. Two types of micro nozzle were fabricated and compared for performance. The total mass of the rockets was 7.32 g and that of propellant (gun powder) was 0.65 g. The thrust-to-weight ratio was between 1.58 and 1.74, and the flight test with 45 degree launch angle from the ground resulted in 46 m similar to 53 in of horizontal flight distance. In addition, ABS housing for the micro machined rocket was fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). A web-based design, fabrication, and test system for micro nozzles was proposed to integrate the distributed hardware resources. Test data was sent to the designer via the same web server for the faster feedback to the rocket designer.

AB The objective of this study is to conduct a unified computational analysis for computing design parameters, such as axial thrust and convective and radiative wall heat fluxes for regeneratively cooled liquid rocket-engine nozzles, to develop a strategy to compute those parameters through parametric investigations. The computational methodology is based on a multidimensional, finite-volume, turbulent, chemically reacting, radiating, unstructured-grid, pressure-based formulation with grid-refinement capabilities. Systematic parametric studies on effects of wall boundary conditions, combustion chemistry, radiation coupling, computational-cell shape, and grid refinement were performed and assessed. Under the computational framework of this study, the computed axial-thrust performance, flow features, and wall heat fluxes compared well with those of available data and calculations using a combination of structured-grid-dominated mesh, finite-rate chemistry, and cooled wall boundary conditions.

AB A design study was performed to define and compare the parameters of horizontal- and vertical-takeoff reusable launch-vehicle systems to identify promising configurations for further developmental emphasis. The investigation considered both two-stage rockets and single-stage airbreathing ramjet/scramjet-powered vehicles, thus representing next-generation and third-generation configurations, respectively. The payload requirement for each vehicle was 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile circular Earth orbit launched easterly from Kennedy Space Center. All vehicles were first analyzed using liquid hydrogen for the entire trajectory and then reanalyzed with liquid hydrocarbon fuel for the first stage, if a rocket, or for the low-speed trajectory segment to ramjet start for the airbreathers. The vertical-takeoff airbreathing vehicles were found to have the lowest empty weights and gross takeoff weights of all of the vehicle configurations, with three-dimensional inward-turning inlets outperforming two-dimensional inlets, and the use of hydrocarbon fuel outperforming hydrogen fuel for the launch propulsive segment to ramjet start. The best horizontal takeoff vehicle is the all-hydrogen inward-turning airbreather. For the two-stage rockets, the lightest empty weight was achieved with the use of hydrocarbon fuel in the booster and hydrogen fuel in the orbiter.

AB In the solid rocket propellant formulations an important component is the polymeric binder. Actually, the most used binder is hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. However, the research is oriented toward the use of energetic polymers which, in addition to the binder function, should improve the propulsion capability of the propellant. in this respect, good candidates are oxetanic polyethers with azidic functionalities in their side chains. Considering the explosive character of such materials, their synthesis must be designed with attention to the safety of the process. in this note, the preparation of azidic copolymers is described and different synthetic strategies are discussed and compared.

AB While policies of government and attitude of senior scientists impact crucially on the effectiveness of science institutions, clarity of their mission, internal work culture, human resource development practices and linkages with other institutions also play vital role in creating congenial ambience. The learning experiences of ISRO, in respect of work culture, analytical approach to development and collaboration with academic, research and industrial institutions point to their critical value. As these aspects of the work of ISRO are not as well known as are the satellite and launch vehicle projects, this article gives an overview with the expectation that it would add useful data on functioning of institutions in India and on creating congenial work, environment for budding scientists.

TI Zonal wind velocity profiles in the equatorial electrojet derived from

SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID E-REGION; NEUTRAL WINDS; INCOHERENT-SCATTER; IRREGULARITIES;

AB Zonal wind profiles in the daytime equatorial electrojet are inferred from the Doppler shifts of type II radar echoes observed at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) in Peru. The inference is based on a three-dimensional electrostatic potential model. The model includes anomalous effects and is constrained by radar and magnetometer data. The amplitude and phase of the calculated zonal wind profiles are in general agreement with representative wind profiles measured by the WINDII instrument on board the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The calculated winds also have the same general characteristics as zonal wind profiles measured by rocket-borne chemical release experiments. However, the magnitude of the latter are larger than the former. The temporal behavior of the calculated zonal winds suggests a downward phase progression with a roughly semidiurnal period.

AB The RBCC (RING finger, B-box type zinc finger, coiled-coil domain) motif family contains a large number of proteins implicated in many cellular processes, including vesicle exocytosis. The acrosome reaction, the sperm exocytotic event that is required for fertilization, involves essentially the same process of intracellular membrane fusions as vesicular exocytosis in somatic cells. We have previously isolated a haploid-germ-cell-specific gene designated haprin, which encodes a RBCC motif protein that plays a role in the acrosome reaction of sperm by mediating protein complex formation via the RBCC motif. In this review, we describe the potential role of Haprin in the molecular mechanisms of acrosome reaction, as compared with some other RBCC proteins. The conserved structure and localization of the Haprin protein in human and mouse suggest an indispensable role for Haprin in the functioning of mammalian sperm.

AB With ESA's INTEGRAL mission gamma-ray astronomy has advanced to the point where major scientific advances must be expected from detailed studies of the many new point sources. The interest in developing focusing telescopes operating in the soft gamma-ray regime up to 1 MeV is therefore mounting rapidly. Telescopes based on Laue diffraction of gamma-rays from crystals appear as one promising route, although the practical difficulties of realizing a large scale Laue lens are certainly not small. In this paper I have attempted to develop an optimized lens design considering the size and mass constraints of a specific medium size launch vehicle. The introduction of the lens mass as a primary design driver has some surprising effects for the choice of material for the crystals and new tradeoff considerations are introduced.

AB As NASA prepared the Space Shuttle for its first return-to-flight mission (STS-114) in July of 2005, a number of new visual and radar sensors were used during the critical ascent phase of the flight, to assess if unintentional debris was liberated from the Shuttle as it raced into orbit. New high-resolution C-band and X-band radars were used to help ascertain the location and speed of released debris. We also used both radars to monitor debris generated by routine flight events, such as solid rocket booster (SRB) separation. To assure that these new radars did not interfere with flight-critical engine subsystems, an electromagnetic interference (EMI) measurement was performed on the Shuttle Orbiter Discovery in January, 2005, using the Air Force Research Laboratory's Mobile Diagnostic Laboratory (MDL). This portable EM measurement system performed a large number of attenuation measurements the night of January 17-18, 2005. This paper describes how the attenuation data were acquired, and the methodology used to reduce the data to predict average attenuation of the radar energy from the outside world to the inside of the aft engine bay of the Orbiter. These data were combined with a separate NASA-performed avionics EMI analysis to demonstrate that the new C- and X-band debris radars could be operated without adversely interfering with the Orbiter aft-bay avionics systems.

AB The Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 will have a mass of 523 kg in a 100 km circular polar orbit around the Moon. The main factors that dictate the design of the Indian Moon mission are to use the present capability of launch vehicles and to achieve the scientific objectives in the minimum development time and cost. The detailed mission planning involves trade-off studies in payload optimization and the transfer trajectory determination that accomplishes these requirements. Recent studies indicate that for an optimal use of the existing launch vehicle and spacecraft systems, highly elliptical inclined orbits are preferable. This indeed is true for the Indian Moon mission Chandrayaan-1. The proposed launch scenario of the Indian Moon mission program and capabilities of this mission are described in this paper, highlighting the design challenges and innovations. Further, to reach the target accurately, appropriate initial transfer trajectory characteristics must be chosen. A numerical search for the initial conditions combined with numerical integration produces the near accurate solution for this problem. The design of such transfer trajectories is discussed in this paper.

AB The chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) technique is a very convenient route to process carbon-carbon and ceramic matrix composites, which are mainly applied to rocket nozzles, brake disks and parts of aeronautic engines. Isothermal isobaric CVI processing already transferred to plant level is rather slow but highly flexible, a large number of parts with complex shapes and different sizes being easily fabricated in the same run. Modified CVI versions exhibit interesting benefits, e.g. in terms of infiltration rate in the case of forced-CVI and nano-materials engineering for pulse-CVI. Silicon carbide and pyrocarbon are basic components of such thermostructural composite materials. In order to control their vapour phase processing, we have undertaken to thoroughly study the involved chemical mechanisms through a multiple investigation including especially kinetics, nucleation, physicochemical characterization and gas phase analysis. Concerning the deposition of SiC-based ceramics from the CH3SiCl3-H-2 precursor, at relatively low temperatures and low pressures, a regime of growth of stoichiometric SiC microcrystals occurs from reaction of CH3 and SiCl3 intermediates, while higher pressures in the chemical control kinetic domain favour a regime of nucleation of nanocrystals with an excess of silicon resulting from SiCl3/SiCl2 effective silicon precursors. In the case of laminar pyrocarbon deposition from propane, its structural anisotropy is controlled by the gas phase maturation; transitions from columnar (CL) to weakly anisotropic (WAL) and to highly anisotropic (HAL) laminar pyrocarbon are observed with increasing residence time, temperature and pressure, the formation of each microtexture being related to the respective concentrations Of C-3 (like propylene), C-2 (like ethylene or acetylene) and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) molecules.

AB Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tanks represent an important percentage of net weight and cost of any reusable launch vehicle (RLV). Moreover they play structural and thermal and propulsive roles at the same time. The transition from metal to composite material is then considered an obliged choice. In this study, a FEM optimisation procedure has been developed in order to both increase payload (by decreasing tank mass) and improve aerodynamic and controllability (by increasing global flexural stiffness). The optimisation of these two contradictory objectives have been obtained using a standard FE numerical tool within an innovative optimisation procedure, as a possible alternative to genetic algorithm approaches [Jaunky N, Knight NF, Ambur DR. Optimal design of general stiffened composite circular cylinders for global buckling with strength constraints. Compos Struct 1998;41:243-52. [1]]. The key features of this procedure are: the starting point determination methodology; a sensitivity analysis based on an integration between the classical laminate theory and the netting theory to validate the FE optimiser results; the strategy of choice of the best compromise solution in terms of design constraints and objective function.

AB A cold-gas setup is used to analyze the internal acoustic response of small-scale solid propellant rocket motors. These motors are characterized by a forward, a central, and an aft segment, with nonablative inhibitors on the last segment forward face. Investigations have been carried out with four inhibitors with different protrusions and shapes, each leading to specific pressure oscillation behavior. The cold-flow setup has been designed to reproduce the general features of the internal geometry of the combustors corresponding to two burning times. It is found that pressure measurements reproduce the acoustic response of firing tests with satisfactory agreement. Velocity fluctuations are used to analyze vortex-shedding-driven pressure oscillations. Measurements in the shear layer generated downstream from the inhibitors and in the vicinity of the injecting wall allow identification of the development of two vortex fields. Experiments with small inhibitors show the development of only one kind of instability, combining the vortex development of the shear layer with an effect of vorticity amplification due to the wall injection. Finally, an estimation of the convection velocity is proposed to explain resonance frequency evolution during the combustion.

ID COMBUSTION
AB A comprehensive dynamic model of a hybrid rocket has been developed to understand and predict the transient behavior including instabilities. A linearized version of the transient model predicted the low-frequency chamber pressure oscillations that are commonly observed in hybrids. The source of the instabilities is based on a complex coupling of thermal transients in the solid fuel, the wall heat transfer blocking due to fuel regression rate, and the transients in the boundary layer that forms on the fuel surface. The oscillation frequencies predicted by the linearized theory are in very good agreement with 43 motor test results obtained from the hybrid propulsion literature. The motor test data used in the comparison cover a very wide spectrum of parameters including 1) four separate research and development programs; 2) three different oxidizers (liquid oxygen, gaseous oxygen, and nitrous oxide); 3) a wide range of motor dimensions, that is, from 5 in. (12.7 cm) diameter to 72 in. (182.9 cm) diameter, and operating conditions; and 4) several fuel formulations. A simple universal scaling formula for the frequency of the primary oscillation mode is also suggested.

AB Arc jet test results are summarized of the Mars Exploration Rover silicone-impregnated reusable ceramic ablator (SIRCA) transverse impulse rocket system (TIRS) cover test series in the Panel Test facility at NASA Ames Research Center. The primary objective of this arc jet test series was to evaluate design details of the SIRCA TIRS cover interface to the aeroshell under simulated atmospheric entry heating conditions. Four test articles were tested in an arc jet environment with three different seal configurations. The test condition was designed to match the predicted peak flight heat load at the gap region between the SIRCA and the backshell and resulted in an overtest for the apex region of the SIRCA TIRS cover. Repeatable thermocouple data were obtained and compared with SIRCA thermal response analyses. The one-dimensional thermal response prediction compared well with the thermocouple data for the location at the backshell interface. For the apex region of the SIRCA TIRS cover, a one-dimensional thermal response analysis resulted in an overprediction because there were strong multidimensional conduction effects due to the TIRS cover geometry. In general, the test results provide strong experimental evidence that supports the adequacy of the baseline seal design.

TI Orbital evolution of cloud particles from explosions of geosynchronous

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

AB Current orbital debris search strategies for telescopes observing in geosynchronous Earth orbit are designed around the known orbital distributions of cataloged objects. However, the majority of cataloged objects are believed to be intact spacecraft and rocket bodies, not the debris particles the searches are intended to locate. If there have been breakups in geosynchronous Earth orbit, the explosions may have put the debris into orbits that are significantly different from those in the catalog. Consequently, observation plans optimized for the catalog population may not be optimized for any unseen debris populations. Some hypothetical cases and a real near-synchronous U.S. Titan IIIC transtage explosion will be presented to demonstrate this effect. perturbing accelerations to be considered for orbital evolution are the nonspherical part of the Earth's gravitational attraction and gravitational attractions due to the sun and moon. Solar radiation pressure effects are omitted in this analysis, not because they are unimportant for this type of analysis, but to concentrate on the primary orbit perturbations.

AB [1] The performance characteristics of the U. S. National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) were evaluated using rocket-triggered lightning data, acquired in the summers of 2001 - 2003 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT), at Camp Blanding, Florida. During the 3-year period, 37 flashes, containing a total of 159 ( 158 negative and 1 positive) strokes, were triggered at Camp Blanding. Flashes consisting of the initial stage only ( having no return strokes) were not considered in this study. Directly measured currents were obtained for 122 of these strokes in 29 flashes. Camp Blanding and NLDN events were correlated using GPS time stamps. The NLDN recorded 95 Camp Blanding strokes in 31 flashes. Of these 95, usable directly measured currents were obtained for 70 strokes in 22 flashes. Flash and stroke detection efficiencies were estimated to be about 84% and 60%, respectively. Median location error was about 600 m, with larger location errors ( greater than 2 km) being associated with strokes having smaller peak currents ( 5 - 10 kA). The NLDN tended to underestimate peak current, with the median peak current estimation error ( signed) being about 18%. There was a steady trend of improved stroke detection efficiency from 2001 to 2003.

AB Among the most important insights into coronary and inflammatory disease is that the formation of vessel occluding placques is its essence an inflammatory process, that is counteracted by anti-inflammatory drugs Current therapeutical options of dealing with the increased challenge to public health posed by increased vessel disease are limited and unsatisfactory. Disturbingly, an increasing cohort of patients does not react to the immunosuppressive drugs available. Importantly, however, space travel is associated with well-tolerated immunosuppression and thus identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying this space travel-associated immunosuppression may have significant benefit for directing clinical research on earth. Devising an experimental set up for investigating the molecular details of space flight-induced immunosuppression is, however, fraught with difficulties. Two recent ESA-sponsored space missions (the Delta Taxi flight to ISS and Maser 10 sounding rocket mission) have now shown that these technical hurdles can be successfully tackled.

SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DE regression rate; hybrid rocket; metal wire; helical grain
AB Many studies have been conducted to increase regression rate of solid fuel in hybrid rocket. One of them resorts to swirl flow since it can extend the residence time of oxidizer in the fuel grain. Also, metal wires may lead to increase the regression rate of solid fuel as shown in solid propellants. In this study, a series of experiments was designed to investigate the enhancement of regression rate of solid fuel by embedded metal wires and by fuel port grain. And fuel port was designed with a helical configuration to attempt to induce swirl flow. PMMA with gaseous oxygen is the solid fuel used for investigation. Test results showed that embedded metal wires turned out to be ineffective method because only 3-4% increases in regression rate were observed. However, fuel port grain configuration yields higher burning performance of up to 50% increase in regression rate. Also pitch number as well as total impulse was found to be a design variable.

AB The quality of cast billets of aluminium alloys essentially dictates their behaviour during further downstream processing for fabrication of hardwares and their performance in service. The stringent design criteria demanded by launch vehicle applications cannot be met without controlling various detrimental factors of material, like presence of impurities and trace elements including alkali metals, non metallic inclusions, gas contents etc. during melting stage itself. A general review of the effects of these harmful elements and their control are presented in this paper. A very rational approach to sort out these problems is also suggested.

AB The VISTA spacecraft design concept has been proposed for manned or heavy cargo deep space missions beyond earth orbit with inertial fusion energy propulsion. Rocket propulsion is provided by fusion power deposited in the inertial confined fuel pellet debris and with the help of a magnetic nozzle.
   The calculations for the radiation shielding have been revised under the fact that the highest jet efficiency of the vehicle could be attained only if the propelling plasma would have a narrow temperature distribution. The shield mass could be reduced from 600 tons in the original design to 62 tons. Natural and enriched lithium were the principle shielding materials. The allowable nuclear heating in the superconducting magnet coils (up to 5 mW/cm(3)) is taken as the crucial criterion for dimensioning the radiation shielding structure of the spacecraft. The space craft mass is 6000 tons.
   Total peak nuclear power density in the coils is calculated as similar to 5.0 mW/cm(3) for a fusion power output of 17 500 MW. The peak neutron heating density is similar to 2.0 mW/cm(3), and the peak 7-ray heating density is similar to 3.0 mW/cm3 (on different points) using natural lithium in the shielding. However, the volume averaged heat generation in the coils is much lower, namely 0.21, 0.71 and 0.92 mW/cm(3) for the neutron, 7-ray and total nuclear heating, respectively. The coil heating will be slightly lower if highly enriched 6 Li (90%) is used instead of natural lithium. Peak values are then calculated as 2.05, 2.15 and 4.2 mW/cm for the neutron, 7-ray and total nuclear heating, respectively. The corresponding volume averaged heat 3 generation in the coils became 0.19, 0.58 and 0.77 mW/cm. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An SPS power relay system for delivering multi-megawatts of grid electric power from GEO via a stratospheric airship platform is presented. A solar powered laser is proposed to beam power to InGaN band-gap matched PV located in a station-kept platform, where the received DC power is converted to 2.45 GHz microwave beams for relay to the surface using a phased array. To complete the power transmission link, spatially diverse, 260-m diameter rectennas provide the interfaces to the electric utility power grid. Unique requirements include that it is to be an all-weather electric delivery system, to be purposely designed to preclude its use as a power beam weapon at the Earth's surface, and to be delivered to orbit in a single launch vehicle. Estimates are presented for the airship design assumptions, expected performance parameters and the various power conversion and power transfer efficiencies and the cost of the parts of the system, along with the suggested alternate revenue sources for making the high altitude platform more cost effective. Unfortunately, the cost to orbit dominates. The sunlight-to-grid power collection, conversion and transfer efficiency of order 8.2 % is double that of ground based PV systems given their day-night, atmosphere and weather handicaps.

AB Use of aluminized composite solid propellants and submerged nozzles are common in solid rocket motors (SRM). Due to the generation of slag, which injects into a combusted gas flow, a two-phase flow pattern is one of the main flow characteristics that need to be investigated in SRM. Validation of two-phase flow modeling in a solid rocket motor combustion chamber is the focus of this research. The particles' boundary conditions constrain their trajectories, which affect both the two-phase flow calculations, and the evaluation of the slag accumulation. A harsh operation environment in the SRM with high temperatures and high pressure makes the measurement of the internal flow field quite difficult. The open literature includes only a few sets of experimental data that can be used to validate theoretical analyses and numerical calculations for the two-phase flow in a SRM. Therefore, mathentatical models that calculate the trajectories of particles may reach different conclusions mainly because of the boundary canditions. A new method to determine the particle velocities on the solid propellant surface is developed in this study, which is based on the x-ray real-time radiography (RTR) technique, and is coupled with the two-phase flow numerical simulation. Other methods imitate the particle ejection from the propellant surface. The RTR high-speed motion analyzer measures the trajectory of the metal particles in a combustion chamber An image processing software was developed for tracing a slug particle path with the RTR images in the combustion chamber, by which the trajectories of particles were successfully obtained.

DE combustion instability; stability boundary; hot-fire injector test;
   model combustion chamber
AB This study realizes the conceptual method to predict combustion instability in actual full-scale combustion chamber of rocket engines by experimental tests with model (sub-scale) chamber. The model chamber was designed based on the methodologies proposed in the previous work regarding geometrical dimensions and operating conditions, and hot-fire test procedures were followed to obtain stability boundaries. From the experimental tests, two instability regions are presented by the parameters of combustion-chamber pressure and mixture (oxidizer/fuel) ratio, which are customary for combustor designers. It is found that instability characteristics in the chamber with the adopted jet injectors can be explained by the correlation between the characteristic burning or mixing time and the characteristic acoustic time. In each instability region, dynamic behaviors of flames are investigated to verify the hydrodynamically-derived characteristic lengths of the jet injectors. Large-amplitude pressure oscillation observed in upper instability region is found to be generated by lifted-off flames.

AB The analytical solution of the deployment phase of a spacecraft formation is provided. The solution applies to Earth-centered invariant formations. These feature a fixed geometry over one revolution, which renders them useful for numerous purposes, especially radar interferometry and sparse aperture synthesis. First, a formulation useful for formation design is defined in terms of nonsingular elements. This is used as,a basis for solving the deployment phase. The primer vector theory is applied to obtain the minimal fuel consumption. Next, this theory is combined with a geometrical approach to yield the maneuver components of the optimal solution. In addition, the payload separation strategy from the rocket upper stage is also optimized to take into account the collision risk.

AB [1] The NASA SIERRA rocket mission was a multiple-payload, auroral plasma physics experiment that flew into a 100 nT auroral substorm at altitudes up to 735 km over the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska on 14 January 2002. The flight environment was composed of an equatorward region of inverted-V electron precipitation followed by a poleward region of mostly field-aligned suprathermal electron bursts. In the inverted-V region, the measured delta E/delta B implied a stationary field-aligned current configuration. In the poleward region, the average electric field was much larger, 50 mV/m compared with 20 mV/m, included time-varying components that exceeded 100 mV/m with periods of 0.5 - 5 s, and delta E/delta B was Alfvenic. Our multiple-payload observations show that the perpendicular scale size of most of these waves is on the order of a kilometer or less. At smaller scales, broadband, extremely low-frequency (BBELF) fluctuations associated with observed Alfven waves had spectral ratios (delta E/delta B) appropriate for inertial Alfven waves larger and smaller than the electron inertial length (lambda(e) = c/omega(pe)), but the phase angle differences between delta E and delta B indicate mostly propagating Alfven waves for spatial scales much larger than lambda(e) and a transition to spatial perturbations, embedded in the plasma, for scales near lambda(e). The data are consistent with the model of kilometer-scale oblique Alfvenic arcs that are unstable to the current shear-driven instabilities discussed in previous theoretical investigations, lending support to the conclusion that the observed BBELF fluctuations are likely driven by the wave-associated field-aligned current shear.

   earth-orbiting ARGOS spacecraft

AB In this paper, we present the final report of the data obtained from the Space Dust (SPADUS) instrument on the Earth-orbiting Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS). The University of Chicago's SPADUS instrument on the US Air Force's Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite has been operating in a nearly polar orbit, at an altitude of approximately 850 km, since soon after its launch on day 54, 1999 (23 February) until termination of the SPADUS operations on day 248, 2001 (5 September).
   The instrument consists of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) dust trajectory system, which includes two planar arrays of PVDF sensors (a total of 16 sensors per array) separated by 20.25 cm to provide time of flight (TOF) measurements. The trajectory system measures dust particle flux, mass distribution, velocity and trajectory. The instrument also includes the SPADUS Ancillary Diagnostic Sensor (ADS) subsystem, which measured energetic charged particles (electrons, protons, etc).
   The PVDF dust trajectory system detected a total of 368 dust impacts over the SPADUS live-time interval of 739 days, yielding an average particle flux of 0.50 impacts/day. Of these 368 impacts, 35 were D1-D2 type events-where particles impacted and penetrated a D1 sensor, then impacted a D2 rear array sensor-allowing for time-of-flight measurements. Of the 35 D1-D2 impacts on SPADUS, we identified 19 D1-D2 impacts yielding TOF values. Of these 19 events, 14 were ambiguous (either bound or interplanetary) and 5 were unambiguous interplanetary impacts. Examples of particle orbits for debris particles as well as D1-D2 impacts are detailed. We also describe transient particle streams detected by the SPADUS trajectory system, resulting from the passage of ARGOS through streams of debris particles in Earth orbit. One of the streams was shown to result from detection by SPADUS of the debris generated by the explosion of a Chinese booster rocket.
   The SPADUS flight data accumulated over the 30-month mission shows that PVDF-based dust instruments utilizing two planar arrays of PVDF dust sensors in a TOF arrangement-can provide useful measurements of particle velocity, mass distribution, flux, trajectory and particle orbital elements.

AB The MBSAT spacecraft was launched on 13 March 2004 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on an Atlas III-A launch vehicle. The satellite is now in service at its orbital location of 144 degrees E longitude. The satellite is designed to provide high-quality audio, video and data services to mobile users in Japan and Korea. Broadcast transmissions use 25 MHz of bandwidth at the S-band frequency of 2.6 GHz, while uplinks and feeder links to terrestrial repeaters use the Ku-band. The MBSAT satellite design incorporates a large, unfurlable, mesh reflector for S-band broadcast. This 12 m (effective aperture) reflector coupled with phase-combined arrays of Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers result in Effective Isotropic Radiated Power levels of 67-69 dBW over Japan and Korea coverage areas. The use of Stationary Plasma Thrusters for North-South stationkeeping significantly enhances the mission lifetime as well as minimizes potential disturbances to the 12 m reflector.

AB From October 1987 until 1993, the US Department of Defense conducted the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion program. This program's objective was to design and develop a high specific impulse, high thrust-to-weight nuclear thermal rocket engine for upper stage applications. The author was the program manager for this program until 1992. Numerous analytical, programmatic and experimental results were generated during this period of time. This paper reviews the accomplishments of the program and highlights the importance of prototypic testing for all aspects of a space nuclear program so that a reliable and safe system compliant with all regulatory requirements can be effectively engineered. Specifically, the paper will recount how many non-prototypic tests we performed only to have more representative tests consistently generate different results. This was particularly true in area of direct nuclear heat generation. As nuclear tests are generally much more expensive than non-nuclear tests, programs attempt to avoid such tests in favor of less expensive non-nuclear tests. Each time this approach was followed, the SNTP program found these tests to not be verified by nuclear heated testing. Hence the author recommends that wherever possible, a spiral development approach that includes exploratory and confirmatory experimental testing be employed to ensure a viable design.

AB A cryogenic tank made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) shell with aluminum thin liner has been designed as a liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank for an ISAS reusable launch vehicle, and the function of it has been proven by repeated flights onboard the test vehicle called reusable vehicle testing (RVT) in October 2003. The liquid hydrogen tank has to be a pressure vessel, because the fuel of the engine of the test vehicle is supplied by fuel pressure. The pressure vessel of a combination of the outer shell of CFRP for strength element at a cryogenic temperature and the inner liner of aluminum for gas barrier has shown excellent weight merit for this purpose. Interfaces such as tank outline shape, bulk capacity, maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP), thermal insulation, pipe arrangement, and measurement of data are also designed to be ready onboard. This research has many aims, not only development of reusable cryogenic composite tank but also the demonstration of repeated operation including thermal cycle and stress cycle, familiarization with test techniques of operation of cryogenic composite tanks, and the accumulation of data for future design of tanks, vehicle structures, safety evaluation, and total operation systems.

AB The FALCON program is a technology demonstration effort with three major components: a Small Launch Vehicle (SLV), a Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (HTV), and a Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV). Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and executed jointly by the United States Air Force and DARPA with NASA participation, the objectives are to develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable both near-term and far-term capability to execute time-critical, global reach missions. The focus of this paper is on the SLV as it relates to small satellites and the implications of lower cost to orbit for small satellites. The target recurring cost for placing 1000 pounds payloads into a circular reference orbit of 28.5 degrees at 100 nautical miles is $5,000,000 per launch. This includes range costs but not the payload or payload integration costs. In addition to the nominal 1000 pounds to low earth orbit (LEO), FALCON is seeking delivery of a range of orbital payloads from 220 to 2200 pounds to the reference orbit. Once placed on 'alert' status, the SLV must be capable of launch within 24h. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will be launched in August 2005 by an Atlas V 401 expendable launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, USA. It will deliver to Mars orbit a payload to conduct remote sensing science observations, identify and characterize sites for future landers, and provide critical telecom/navigation relay capability for follow-on missions. The mission is designed to provide global, regional survey, and targeted observations from a low 255 km by 320km Mars orbit with a 3:00 PM local mean solar time (ascending node). During the one Martian year (687 Earth days) primary science phase, the orbiter will acquire visual and near-infrared high-resolution images of the planet's surface, monitor atmospheric weather and climate, and search the upper crust for evidence of water. After this science phase is completed, the orbiter will provide telecommunications support for spacecraft launched to Mars in the 2007 and 2009 opportunities. The primary mission ends on December 31, 2010, approximately 5.5 years after launch. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB One of the defining attributes of the Vision for Space Exploration is its emphasis on affordability, which is also linked to another key attribute-long-term sustainability. As applied to space-lift requirements, this overriding constraint may argue for system choices not optimized for architectural elegance but, rather, for lowest development or recurring cost. Affordability constrains most projects and, second only to safety, may be the most important factor in the success of the Vision for Space Exploration. Finding the most affordable space launch approach and designing the architecture for cost may be the key to shaping the overall exploration architecture for success.

AB First, the actual change of paradigm for launch systems development is discussed: a future new launch vehicle program will require a clear economic justification, different from that in the past where military requirements, technology demonstration and national prestige were the prime drivers. For the approval of a new vehicle development funding, the following requirements probably need to be fulfilled:
   (1) The specific transportation cost must be lower (i.e. 50% or less) than those of existing systems, and
   (2) the development cost is to be minimized by modern cost engineering and management principles.
   These ground rules are valid both for new Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs) as well as for Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs). For Europe, the GTO mission for the launch of geosynchronous satellites is still the prime requirement for the next generation launch system after ARIANE 5. This more complex mission (compared to the previously assumed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) target) makes the definition of the most cost-efficient concept a challenge. Several technical options are feasible. One important factor is the payload capability to be specified: a larger payload (with dual launch capability) reduces the specific transportation cost but increases the vehicle size and the required development effort. These effects are shown in the paper, as well as the impact of the launch rate (annual number of launches) on the specific transportation cost. It is further shown which cost reductions could be expected in principle for future Geo Transfer Orbit (GTO) launch systems, depending on the vehicle concept, the payload capability and launch rate.

AB Strategic ballistic missiles are the long-range missiles designed to intercept stationary, defined targets. Guidance is in the boost phase which represents only a small fraction of the total time of flight of the missile. A missile has to be guided and steered to the required position and velocity states at the end of the boost phase. The problem of guiding a vehicle in atmospheric phase in the presence of drag and lift, poses a challenge for the designer. This paper describes an energy management guidance scheme for guiding the vehicle in atmospheric phase of the flight. The estimated drag is taken care of by the guidance scheme. Uncertainty in velocity due to drag or impulse variation at the end of the boost phase are corrected by an augmented velocity package. A closed-loop guidance scheme has been used during this phase also. A ballistic re-entry has been considered for this design study.

AB The spectral radiant characteristics of plume particles of a solid rocket engine are important in the design of the engine specific impulse, ablative material, and plume flame hiding. These parameters are measured from tests of the engine. Some equipment has been established to realize particle heating, uniform particle distribution, and measurements based on an FTIR spectral instrument. The equipment is based on SiC heating and is divided into a warm-up chamber and a measurement chamber to improve the particle temperature stability. A special design of uniform particle distribution combined with an acoustic levitation device is used to determine the particle falling speed. The spectral characteristics and the transmission rate of the particles have been measured by using the system including a standard blackbody, an assembled optical system, and an FTIR spectrometer. The measurements of particle concentration and temperature are given in detail. The instrument specifications are as follows: temperature range - 60-1500 degrees C; spectral range - 0.60-25 mu m; and particle dimension range - 10-500 mu m.

AB The processing of multi-wavelength pyrometer data is a problem that needs further improvements. The solutions developed in earlier decades generally assumed one particular mathematical relation for emissivity versus wavelength in the wavelength range of the measurements. Sometimes this assumption worked and produced acceptable results, but in many other cases this approach provided erroneous results. Individual results were strongly dependent on the assumed mathematical relation that often needed some prior knowledge of the emissivity behavior in the wavelength range. A new data processing method for a multi-wavelength pyrometer for continuous temperature measurements is presented. A linear relation between emissivity and true temperature at different wavelengths is assumed. Based on this assumption, the true temperatures and spectral emissivities at the two continuous temperature measurement points can be simultaneously calculated. Some experimental results for the practical data processing of measurements performed on a solid propellant rocket engine show that the difference between the calculated true temperature and the theoretical true temperature indicated by the rocket engine designer is within +/- 20 K.

AB Using rocket-grade hydrogen peroxide and a nontoxic, hypergolic miscible fuel, a 150-lbf thrust class pintle injector engine has been developed and tested with the aim of characterizing injector performance under a variety of design and operating conditions. Rapid, reproducible ignition was sustained under a wide range of operating conditions using the new hypergolic propellant combination. Parametric studies were undertaken to assess the influence of characteristic chamber length V, chamber diameter-to-pintle diameter ratio, total momentum ratio, secondary-to-primary hole diameter ratio, and the pintle length-to-pintle diameter ratio. High performance has been achieved in both steady-state and pulse mode operation.

AB The results of optimizing some of the geometric design variables of the inletlejector section of a rocket-based combined-cycle (RBCC) engine and the study of its performance trends are presented. A two-dimensional rocket-ejector system was studied over a matrix of engine design variables. Bypass ratio, ejector compression ratio, and ejector/mixer thrust efficiency were used to analyze RBCC internal flowpath physics. The primary thruster exit How properties were calculated with the reacting and multiphase program, which was used as fixed inlet conditions for the ejector/mixer analysis. The computational fluid dynamics simulations of the inlet/ejector system were carried out with a finite difference Navier-Stokes code. The GO(2)/GH(2) combustion physics were solved for finite rate conditions with a system of seven species and nine reactions. Neural networks techniques were used to generate the response surface. The desirability function approach of optimization, tied with the response surface, was used for inlet/ejector optimization. This approach gives the designers the freedom to set up their own priorities on the response values to be built into the optimization procedure. Optimum values of primary thruster size, duct length-to-diameter ratio and ramjet burner to ejector/mixer inlet area ratio were obtained. Engine performance trends as functions of geometric variables were also studied.

TI Three-dimensional flow simulations in the recessed region of a coaxial
   injector
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A three-dimensional, two-phase, unsteady Navier-Stokes solver has been developed to investigate fluid dynamic instabilities within the recessed region of a shear coaxial injector element. Here, the main emphasis is to study applications related to liquid rocket engine injectors using the gas/liquid shear-coaxial element in which the inner liquid cylindrical post is submerged slightly with respect to the overall exit plane of the device. Because most of the previous works focus on spray structure outside of the injector, this study provides readers with insight into unsteadiness resulting from hydrodynamic instabilities within the internal nozzle flow upstream of the combustion chamber. The present study focuses on unsteady "self-oscillations," which have been theorized by various researchers. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism as a result of velocity discontinuity between gas and liquid phase is investigated as a source of unsteadiness that could contribute to combustion roughness or instabilities. For existing liquid-rocket-engine injectors, mass-flow variations of the order of 30-40% are shown to exist as a result of this highly nonlinear process. Fundamental frequencies are also identified for a range of conditions.

TI Dynamic design of octostrut platform for launch stage whole-spacecraft
   vibration isolation
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Whole-spacecraft vibration isolation is a direct and effective approach to improving the dynamic environment that a spacecraft experiences during its journey to orbit. A method of analysis and dynamic design of an octostrut platform for whole-spacecraft vibration isolation during the launch stage is studied. Because the octostrut platform is a section between the launch vehicle and the spacecraft, structural characteristics of the launch vehicle and the spacecraft will inevitably influence the design of the isolation platform and also the vibration isolation effect, and vice versa. The design is divided into three parts. The first part is the preliminary analysis defining the fundamental parameters of the octostrut platform. In the second part, the parameters of each strut are defined by modeling the octostrut vibration isolation platform in a set of dynamic equations of motion. The third part is the coupling analysis, where finite element models of the octostrut platform, the spacecraft, and the launch vehicle are put together to assess the isolation effect and examine the influence of the isolation platform on the dynamic properties of the whole structure.

ID MOTOR EXHAUST; SCATTERING MATRIX; PLUMES; STRATOSPHERE; SIZE;
   LIMITATIONS; WATER; MODEL
AB The lidar backscatter cross sections of aluminum-oxide rocket exhaust particles are sensitive to slight deviations from their nominal spherical shape. We have therefore determined the distribution of particle shapes using automated image analysis of scanning electron microscope particle photographs. These shape statistics were used in conjunction with T-matrix calculations for nonspherical particles to estimate the backscatter properties of representative rocket exhaust particles. For the range of particle sizes and nonsphericities epsilon relevant to exhaust plumes, both the backscatter intensity and depolarization scale approximately with the product of nonsphericity epsilon times the particle radius (Er). This correlation allows us to formulate a simple model for both the backscatter intensity and the depolarization of typical Al2O3 rocket exhaust particles. This model is applied to a recent particle collection from the exhaust plume of a Titan-IVA rocket obtained from the NASA WB-57F high-altitude research aircraft at an altitude of 19 km.

ID RELIABILITY; OPTIMIZATION
AB A probabilistic optimization methodology for aerospace vehicle design is developed that takes into account coupling between system-level and component-level design requirements. The proposed methodology represents the system-component design as a reliability-based multidisciplinary optimization, problem. The system design optimizes the geometry of a reusable launch vehicle for minimum weight while satisfying aerodynamic constraints. The component design relates to the structural sizing of vehicle components, in this case a liquid-hydrogen tank. The optimization formulation includes probabilistic constraints, which are evaluated using the limit state-based reliability analysis methodology. The system and component designs are linked through stochastic state variables relating to vehicle geometry and component weight, and the optimization at both levels is pursued. Finally, the reliability-based multidisciplinary optimization is solved using an efficient decoupled approach.

AB The Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) is a core instrument on the Japanese Solar-B mission and is due for launch in the summer of 2006. EIS is a 3.2 in long telescope employing grating optics and a pair of charge coupled device imaging cameras working in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region in two separate wavelength bands between 170-210 and 240-290 angstrom. To house all the telescope subsystems, a novel carbon fibre reinforced plastic structure was developed in collaboration with McLaren Composites Limited (UK) to meet a set of the demanding performance requirements in terms of dimensional stability, rigidity, and structural cleanliness as well as being able to survive the harsh launch environment of the Japanese M-V rocket. The final design was based on a honeycomb panel structure using stiff carbon fibre laminates. This case study describes some of the design challenges that were overcome for this project to produce the engineering, mechanical, and thermal models. Particular attention is given to the cleanliness control strategy to preserve the EUV optical throughput, the method of attachment to the spacecraft, and of optical subsystems as well as the instrument thermal design.

AB Test results are presented for short floating ring seals (D = 53.0 mm, L/D = 0.15) using a smooth surface and a round-hole pattern defined as a damper floating ring seal (h/C-r = 3, gamma = 0.34: the ratio of hole area to surface area) for supplied pressures of 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0 MPa, respectively, with the shaft operating speed up to 24,800 rpm. The measured data includes leakage, attitude angle, eccentricity ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness. damping, and inertia. When the floating ring seals are locked up, the eccentricity ratio of the smooth surface floating ring seal is lower than that of the damper floating ring seal. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds. The damping coefficients of the damper floating ring seal are higher than those of the floating ring seal. Whirl frequency ratios of the floating ring seal are lower than the damper floating ring seal with high eccentricity ratio at low operating speed range. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used for high-pressure and high-speed turbopump seals in a liquid rocket engine system.

AB The efficacy of using potting media and fertilizers that are alternatives to conventional materials to produce vegetable transplants needs clarification. Bell pepper, onion and watermelon seed were sown in Container Mix, Lawn and Garden Soil, and Potting Soil, which can be used for organic production in greenhouse transplant production. The alternative media were amended with a 1x rate of Sea Tea liquid fertilizer. Comparisons were made to a system using a conventional potting medium, Reddi-Earth, fertilized with a half-strength (0.5x) rate of a soluble synthetic fertilizer (Peters). Watermelon, bell pepper and onion seedlings were lifted at 3, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively, and heights and dry weights determined. Watermelon were sufficiently vigorous for transplanting regardless of which medium and fertilizer was used. Bell pepper and onion at the scheduled lifting were sufficiently vigorous only if produced with conventional materials. Additional experiments were designed to determine the reason(s) for the weaker seedlings when the alternative products were used. Seedlings maintained in transplant trays, in which media amended weekly with Sea Tea were required to be held for up to an additional 34 days before being vigorous enough for transplanting. Six-week-old bell pepper, or 8-week-old onion, seedlings were transferred to Reddi-Earth in pots and supplied with Sea Tea or Peters fertilizer. Bell pepper treated with Peters were taller and heavier, but onions plants were similar in height and weight regardless of fertilizer used. Other pepper seed were planted in Reddi-Earth and fertilized weekly with Sea Tea at 0.5x, 1x, 2x, or 4x the recommended rate, or the 0.5x rate of Peters. There was a positive linear relationship between seedling height and dry weight for seedlings treated with increasing rates of Sea Tea. Other pepper seed were planted in to Potting Soil, or an organically certified potting medium (Sunshine), and fertilized with a 2x or 4x rate of Sea Tea or a 1 x, 2x, or 4x rate of an organic fertilizer (Rocket Fuel), or in Reddi-Earth fertilized with a 0.5x rate of Peters. There was a positive linear relationship between the rate of Rocket Fuel and heights and dry weights of bell pepper seedlings. However, even at the highest rate seedlings were not equivalent to those produced with conventional practices. Plants treated with the 4x rate of Sea Tea were similar to those produced using conventional materials. Use of Sunshine potting medium and the 4x rate of Sea Tea will produce bell pepper seedlings equivalent in height and dry weight to those produced using conventional materials. The 4x rate of Rocket Fuel used in Sunshine potting medium will produce adequate bell pepper seedlings. The original poor showing of seedlings in the alternative potting media appears to be due to fertilization with Sea Tea at a rate that does not adequately support seedling development.

AB The Deep Impact mission is designed to provide the first opportunity to probe below the surface of a comet nucleus by a high-speed impact. This requires finding a suitable comet with launch and encounter conditions that allow a meaningful scientific experiment. The overall design requires the consideration of many factors ranging from environmental characteristics of the comet ( nucleus size, dust levels, etc.), to launch dates fitting within the NASA Discovery program opportunities, to launch vehicle capability for a large impactor, to the observational conditions for the two approaching spacecraft and for telescopes on Earth.

AB Coherent backscatter from the auroral electrojet was observed by a 30 MHz imaging radar in Anchorage during the Joint Observations of Upper Latitude Electrodynamics ( JOULE) campaign conducted from the Poker Flat Research Range in the spring of 2003. The observations were made at the same time that ionospheric electric fields and plasma number densities were measured in situ by instruments on sounding rockets. Neutral wind profiles were also measured during the campaign from triangulation of chemiluminescent trails from rocket releases. Aperture synthesis radar imaging techniques permit the sorting of the coherent backscatter into small azimuth and range bins and the determination of the scattering altitude. Individual Doppler spectra could thereby be unambiguously associated with in situ electric field measurements in the same small volume. We find that the Doppler shifts of the auroral echoes correspond to the ion acoustic speed times the cosine of the flow angle, where the former is predicted according to an empirical wave heating law. Type I echoes are only observed for very small flow angles regardless of the convection speed.

ID GRADIENT-RESTORATION ALGORITHM; SPACECRAFT
AB We Study various launch vehicle designs for a spacecraft to be launched vertically and ascending to all Earth orbit located at Space Station altitude (h = 463 km). We optimize the trajectory front the maximum payload viewpoint with respect to the angle of attack time history and thrust setting time history. We consider single-stage, double-stage, and triple-stage configurations. To perform the study, we employ a newly developed member of the family of sequential gradient-restoration algorithms for optimal control problems, the multiple-subarc sequential gradient-restoration algorithm.
   Assuming that the engine specific impulse has the best value available today (I-sp = 450s), we Study the effect of the structural factor P. (ratio of the structural mass to sum of structural mass and propellant mass) oil the payload and then develop simple relations connecting the structural factor to the payload. With these relations, we are able to predict the limiting value of the structural factor for which the payload vanishes. To two significant digits, the limiting value is approximately epsilon congruent to 0. 11 for a single-stage configuration, epsilon congruent to 0.27 for a double-stage configuration, and epsilon congruent to 0.33 for a triple-stage configuration. Based oil these results, we Conclude that, given the current values of the engine specific impulse and spacecraft structural factor, a single-stage configuration is not feasible at this particular time, while double-stage and triple-stage configurations are feasible.
   The above limiting values refer to multistage configurations designed with uniform structural factor. Higher payloads and higher limiting values for the last stage structural factor are possible for configurations designed with nonuniform structural factor, that is, with a last-stage structural factor much higher than the structural factors of the previous stages. For example, a double-stage configuration with epsilon(1) = 0-10, epsilon(2) = 0.25 can deliver to orbit a payload mass equal to 4.7% at the takeoff mass; a triple-stage configuration with epsilon(1) = epsilon(1) = 0.10, epsilon(3) = 0.25 can deliver to orbit a payload mass equal to 6.8% of the takeoff mass.

TI Autoignition of kerosene by decomposed hydrogen peroxide in a
   dump-combustor configuration
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID LEAN BLOWOFF
AB In staged-bipropellant rocket combustors that use decomposed hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer, a liquid fuel is injected into the hot decomposition products comprising oxygen and water vapor. For a well-designed combustor, the oxidizer is at a sufficiently high temperature to vaporize and to autoignite the liquid fuel; however, experimental autoignition data in key chamber contraction ratio and propellant equivalence ratio ranges are missing. In this study a transverse injector was used in a dump-combustor configuration to investigate the autoignition characteristics of JP-8 in decomposed hydrogen peroxide, specifically fuel-rich autoignition limits at contraction ratios less than 6 and with high hydrogen peroxide concentrations. The chamber contraction ratio was varied between 3 and 5 to evaluate the effects of chamber gas Mach number (0.45 and 0.27), and the hydrogen peroxide concentration was varied from 85 to 98% by weight to evaluate the effects of oxidizer temperature. Three regimes were noted: strong, weak, and no autoignition. Chamber pressure oscillations with a dominant frequency between 27 and 47 Hz occurred in the weak-autoignition regime. Results showed that as hydrogen peroxide concentration and/or contraction ratio was increased the equivalence ratio that defined the autoignition boundary increased as well. At a contraction ratio of 3.0, no autoignition was achieved at equivalence ratios of 1.37 and above using 85% hydrogen peroxide, but with 98% hydrogen peroxide autoignition occurred at an equivalence ratio as high as 2.06. When the contraction ratio was increased to 5.0, autoignition was achieved at an equivalence ratio of 1.38 using 85% hydrogen peroxide. These data provide a starting point for the development of an accurate autoignition model and an empirical basis for the design of efficient combustors.

AB Pulse detonation rocket engines (PDREs) offer potential performance improvements over conventional designs but represent a challenging modeling task. A quasi-one-dimensional, finite rate chemistry computational fluid dynamics model for PDREs is described and implemented. Four different PDRE geometries are evaluated in this work: a baseline detonation tube, a detonation tube with a straight extension, and a detonation tube with two types of converging/diverging (CD) nozzles. The effect of extension length and CD nozzle area ratio on the single-pulse gasdynamics and performance of a PDRE is studied over a wide range of blowdown pressure ratios (1-1000). The results indicate that a CD nozzle is generally more effective than a straight extension in improving PDRE performance, particularly at higher pressure ratios. Additionally, the results show that the blowdown process of the CD nozzle systems could be beneficially cut off well before the pressure at the endwall reaches the ambient value. The single-pulse performance results are also compared to some recent experimental measurements as well as a steady-state rocket system using similar modeling assumptions.

AB The objective of this research was to study heat insulation performance and fracture behavior of thermal barrier-type functionally graded material (FGM) coatings under high heat flux. The FGM coatings with thicknesses varying from 0.75 to 2.1 nun were designed and deposited onto a steel substrate by plasma spraying. With the high heat flux of 0.68 MW m(-2), the thickest specimen exhibits a high surface temperature of 1690 degrees C and the corresponding temperature difference between the top surface and the bottom surface of the coating is high up to 760 degrees C. The results of thermal cycling test with a surface temperature of 1400 degrees C (during heating) showed that there existed a great difference in fracture location between different specimens. Fracture behavior of the coatings at surface temperatures of 1500, 1600 and 1700 degrees C was also investigated. The coating thickness and surface temperature were found to influence the number and the length of cracks. The specimen with the coating thickness of 1.1 mm is the most susceptible to local spallation at the top ceramic coat, while the thickest FGM coating is the most susceptible to cracking at the interface close to the bond coat. Heating time also had an effect on cracking behavior. These results provided some necessary information for appropriate design of FGM coatings to sustain higher temperatures and gradients than those in today's applications.

AB The objective of this research was to study heat insulation performance and fracture behavior of thermal barrier-type functionally graded material (FGM) coatings under high heat flux. The FGM coatings with thicknesses varying from 0.75 to 2.1 nun were designed and deposited onto a steel substrate by plasma spraying. With the high heat flux of 0.68 MW m(-2), the thickest specimen exhibits a high surface temperature of 1690 degrees C and the corresponding temperature difference between the top surface and the bottom surface of the coating is high up to 760 degrees C. The results of thermal cycling test with a surface temperature of 1400 degrees C (during heating) showed that there existed a great difference in fracture location between different specimens. Fracture behavior of the coatings at surface temperatures of 1500, 1600 and 1700 degrees C was also investigated. The coating thickness and surface temperature were found to influence the number and the length of cracks. The specimen with the coating thickness of 1.1 mm is the most susceptible to local spallation at the top ceramic coat, while the thickest FGM coating is the most susceptible to cracking at the interface close to the bond coat. Heating time also had an effect on cracking behavior. These results provided some necessary information for appropriate design of FGM coatings to sustain higher temperatures and gradients than those in today's applications.

AB The design of a thrust chamber for a rocket propulsion system is a challenging task. The thrust chamber has to be designed for miminum structural weight with an adequate factor of safety. This calls for a thorough knowledge of various structural loads, both internal and external. and the behaviour of the structure in flight. This paper presents the design and structural analysis of a pressure vessel used as thrust chamber for a rocket propulsion unit. The effects of kinetic heating, thermal stress, spinning and various aerodynamic loads and their mutual interactions are accounted for in this analysis. Based oil a detailed stress analysis of the components and a modal/structural dynamic analysis of the flight vehicle as a whole, in which the thrust chamber is the main load bearing member, the required mechanical properties of the thrust chamber are obtained.

DE evolutionary computation; data mining; optimization
AB This paper focuses on integration of computational methods for design optimization based on data mining and knowledge discovery. We propose to use radial basis function neural networks to analyze the large database generated from evolutionary algorithms and to extract the cause-effect relationship, between the objective functions and the input design variables. The aim is to improve the optimization process by either reducing the computation cost or improving the optimal. Also, it is hoped to provide designers with the salient design pattern about the problem under consideration, from the physics-based simulations. The proposed technique is applied to both academic problems and real-world problems, including optimization of an airfoil and the turbopump of a cryogenic rocket engine. Our results demonstrate that these techniques can further improve the design already achieved by the evolutionary algorithms with a slightly additional cost.

   cracking; rocket motors
AB This research conducted an analysis on three failed rocket motors, which are of different types and were used at different times, in order to identify the root cause of cracks occurring in the wing attachment of the Aim-9 (Air Interceptor Missile) rocket motors. Through visual inspection, it was found that the corrosion severity was in proportion to the failure rate in each crack surface. Chemical analysis, microscopic examination, and residual stress determination on the crack surfaces have been carried out to find out the cause of crack initiation and the mechanism of crack growth. The crack origin was covered with mud cracks produced by an interaction of corrosion and stress, and the cracks were propagated along the grain boundary in the longitudinal direction. Also, corrosion-promoting components were found on the crack surface, and the tensile residual stress acted on the channel area of the rocket motor. As a result of the analysis, it is concluded that stress corrosion cracking occurred due to the interaction of corrosive environment and tensile residual stress, which are latent in the rocket motor body.

AB This paper examines the failure bahaviour of maraging steel rocket motor cases to understand the combined stress theories of failure and their use in design. Effects of weld-mismatches on the load bearing capacity of the motor case, failure pressure estimates and their validation through burst pressure testing of the motor case, are discussed. A simplified procedure, which can be easily programmed on a digital computer, is presented for experimental stress analysis through strain gauge measurements oil the surface of the casing during test. A simple expression useful for failure pressure estimates of rocket motor cases having weld mismatch, is presented. The failure pressure estimates are found to be in good agreement with the burst pressure test results of maraging steel motor cases. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We review the foundations and observational support for a new plasma wave mode that has been proposed to explain emissions stimulated by satellite-born high-power radio-frequency sounders. These sounders, which are designed to derive remote electron density profiles from electromagnetic-wave echoes, stimulate plasma resonances in the local plasma. In addition to stimulating resonances at the electron plasma frequency f(pe), harmonics of electron gyrofrequency f(ce), and at the upper hybrid frequency f(uh), resonances are also stimulated at frequencies below f(pe) between the gyroharmonics. The first such resonance, with frequency between f(ce) and 2f(ce), was discovered by Nelms and Lockwood in 1967 using the topside sounder on Alouette 2. From its appearance, it was called a diffuse resonance (D-1 in modern notation) and was originally thought to have a frequency of 3/2f(ce). Further observations, and theoretical insights, indicated that f(D1) is dependent on f(pe) and f(ce), namely, f(D1) = (3/pi)(f(pe)f(ce))(1/2). The theoretical concepts used to obtain this expression indicated that the D-n resonances (n = 1, 2, 3....) are electron eigen-modes (electromagnetic bounded states) and led to equations describing the frequencies of the entire D-n sequence and their subsidiary resonances D-n(+) and D-n. Such formulas, based on a combined theoretical and empirical approach, describe a root n spectrum with the frequency of each mode split by the magnetic field analogous to the Zeeman splitting in quantum mechanics. The root n spectrum was first predicted for force-free electromagnetic cylindrical plasma oscillations by Osherovich in 1986. The main theoretical challenge remains to derive the frequency f(D1) from first principles. Although the D-n resonances have been stimulated in the terrestrial ionosphere for decades by topside sounder satellites such as Alouette 2 and by electron guns on several rocket experiments, and in Jupiter's Io plasma torus by the sounder on the Ulysses space probe, and are currently being stimulated in the terrestrial magnetosphere by the sounder on the IMAGE spacecraft, they have yet to be observed in laboratory experiments.

AB This paper presents in brief the formulation used for the studies of lateral and longitudinal dynamics associated with separation and pull out of an ongoing functional stage from the spent stage of a multistage launch vehicle using retro rockets as jettisoning system. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed to solve the governing nonlinear differential equations of motion to obtain the state vectors of the separating bodies. A statistical method is adapted to account for the off nominal design parameters of the bodies undergoing separation and the jettisoning system. The tolerances in magnitude of the pull out time, relative velocity, lateral gap and longitudinal clearances between the separating bodies were used to find out the nonoccurrence of collision between the separating bodies. This procedure helps in designing and adapting a suitable jettisoning system to achieve collision free separation of multistage launch vehicle stages. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A sharp boundary model for the deceleration phase of imploding capsules in inertial confinement fusion, in both direct and indirect drive, has been developed. The model includes heat conduction, local a-particle energy deposition, and shell compressibility effects. A differential equation for the temporal evolution of the modal amplitude interface is obtained. It is found that the alpha-particle energy has a strong influence on the evolution of the low I modes, via the compressibility of the shell. The modes are damped by vorticity convection, fire polishing, and alpha-particle energy deposition. The existence of a cutoff l number arises from the high blow of velocity into the hot region (rocket effect) if density gradient scale length effects are taken into account at the interface. The differential equation for, the modal amplitude is used as a postprocessor to the results of I D-SARA code [J. J. Honrubia, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer. 49, 491 (1993)] in a typical capsule for indirect-drive ignition designed on the National Ignition Facility. It is found that modes with l > 180 are completely stabilized. The results are in agreement With two-dimensional simulations. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.

AB Study of the Very Low Cycle Fatigue (VLCF) behavior of materials assumes importance in the context of design of structures that are subjected to extreme loading conditions such as rocket components, earthquakes and accidents. During VLCF, large plastic strains are encountered and the number of cycles to failure is in the range of less than 100. In general, models based on damage mechanics approaches mimic closely the physical phenomena that occur during VLCF and, therefore, are very good candidates suitable for life prediction under such circumstances. In the present study, a simple damage mechanics model based on an earlier proposed model, is considered for the description of stress controlled VLCF. In this model, the life of a material undergoing VLCF is expressed in terms of the maximum stress and the plastic strain. At present, the capability is limited to uniaxial loading but can be extended to multiaxial loading with due modifications. For the numerical validation of the model, uniaxial stress controlled very low cycle fatigue tests have been carried out on commercial steel and mild steel at different stress levels. It is shown that the life predicted by the present model is in close agreement with the experimental results.

TI Multiple sounding rocket observations of charged dust in the polar
   winter mesosphere
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PARTICLES; PLASMA; LIDAR
AB We present data from a winter 2002 sounding rocket campaign for multiple observations of mesospheric charged dust. The campaign consisted of four identically instrumented payloads carrying detectors for charged mesospheric dust particles. The payloads reached an altitude of 100 km in the nighttime mesosphere and were flown from Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska, in conjunction with observations by the UAF sodium and iron resonance lidar system. Three of the four flights flew in sequence during the course of one night to study the temporal evolution of dust layers. Observations show good correlations between structure seen in the charged dust altitude profile, structure seen in the neutral metal layers observed by the lidars, and structure in the plasma density seen by the onboard Langmuir probes. The dust detector is sensitive to positively and negatively charged dust particles with ram energies of 1 to 11 eV for negatively and 3-11 eV for positively charged dust; that is, particles of approximately 5000 amu. The charged dust densities seen ( estimated to be approximately 5 to 10 percent of the total dust density) are approximately 100 particles per cc, and the dust is negatively charged. Variations in the dust density of about 10% are seen in conjunction with structure in the plasma density and with the neutral metal layers. In this paper we present the details of the dust data and instrumentation; a companion paper explores the implications of the correlations seen between the dust and other mesospheric layers.

AB This paper reviews the research and development work on CL-20, the most powerful high-energy material of today, as well as CL-20-based formulations. Methods of CL-20 synthesis and processes for obtaining a desired particle size are discussed. Particular attention is paid to optimization of conditions for obtaining the most stable high-density polymorph. The Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction appear to be effective means for distinguishing CL-20 polymorphs. The thermal decomposition pattern of CL-20 as well as the proposed decomposition and combustion mechanisms also form part of this manuscript. Investigations performed by various researchers show that its relatively high sensitivity needs special attention from the viewpoint of CL-20 preparation and processing of formulations based on this substance. Salient features of CL-20-based explosives and gun/rocket propellants studied are included into this review. CL-20 may be ranked as the most attractive compound for futuristic explosive and propellant formulations. The research activities performed by the authors on synthesis and characterization of CL-20 are briefly described.

AB This paper presents a methodology for designing an aerospace launch vehicle autopilot. Linear controllers are first designed using a multi-objective method based on the Youla parameterization and the optimization under constraints described by linear matrix inequalities. These controllers are then interpolated in such a way that the stability of the closed-loop plant is guaranteed. Results obtained from a nonlinear simulator against wind disturbances and parameter uncertainties are then given. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the development of the models for analyzing a Deactivation Furnace System (DFS) for processing rockets containing the agent GB (Sarin). The DFS is one of the U.S. Army incinerators for destroying the highly toxic chemical agents and munitions contained within the chemical weapons stockpile. The DFS is a gas-fired counterflow rotary kiln designed to treat energetics (fuses, boosters, bursters, and solid rocket propellant). The DFS model consists of two parts: (1) an energetics/rocket piece combustion submodel coupled with a transient zonal furnace combustion model, and (2) the gas-phase combustion/destruction computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The model exhibits good agreement with measured data taken at two incineration sites processing M55 rockets containing GB.

TI Oxide reduction during triggered-lightning fulgurite formation
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE lightning; fulgurite; oxides; reduction
AB In this study triggered-lightning induced fulgurites were formed in 99.9% pure binary oxides of manganese (MnO) and nickel (NiO) in order to study oxide reduction mechanisms. The fulgurite formation process involved packing the oxide in PVC holders and using the standard rocket-and-wire technique to trigger a lightning strike through the oxide at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Camp Blanding, Florida. These two oxides were chosen from the thermodynamic extrapolation of the oxide stability using the Ellingham Diagram. This diagram indicates that NiO is significantly less stable than MnO. Fulgurites from the pure oxides were analyzed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM); secondary electron images, backscattered images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to determine the microstructure and composition of the fulgurites. SEM/EDS analysis of the NiO and MnO prior to fulgurite formation confirmed they were pure binary oxides with no metallic contamination. After fulgurite formation, it was found that the nickel oxide fulgurite contained metallic nickel particles; the manganese oxide fulgurite showed no metallic phase formation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination confirmed that the MnO was a pure oxide with no sign of metallic phase formation. However, TEM results of the NiO showed that approximately 50% of the NiO was reduced to metallic face-centered cubic Ni. The Ni and NiO were observed to be coherent with the [100]Ni//[100]NiO and [110]Ni//[110]NiO. These results are consistent with the aforementioned thermodynamic stability calculations and show that the presence of carbonaceous material or mixtures of oxides is not necessary for oxide reduction during fulgurite formation. These studies do not rule out the possibility that electrolysis plays a role in oxide reduction. However, these fulgurites were made simultaneously during the same lightning strike and therefore were subjected to the same electrical current, and thus it is proposed the thermodynamic stability of the oxide must play a role in oxide reduction.

AB Reusable launch vehicles (RLV) currently envisioned incorporate a Aide variety of propulsion types. Various propulsion devices have been designed, or are being designed. The Integral-Rocket-Ranijet (IRR) propulsion mainly applies to a tactical missile boost system and few have mentioned this system in RLV design. According to the technological ability of Taiwan and a feasibility study, it shows that the present reusable launch system can exploit the potential benefit of H?,R propulsion for the RLV system. A conceptual study of an unmanned two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle is designed in this paper. The first stage of the vehicle is reusable with IRR engines. The second stage is expendable and rocket powered. The assumed mission is designed to insert a 100kg payload into a low earth circular orbit at various inclination angles. The calculations are made for the case where the TSTO system is used in Taiwan. The fundamentals of launch vehicle design are examined using simplified two-stage performance equations. Launch vehicle design is optimized when the performance and progammatic drivers are balanced. There is an acceptable set of launch and landing sites on islands off the coast of Taiwan.

TI Oxidizer control and optimal design of hybrid rockets for small

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION; PROPELLANTS; COMBUSTION; BOOSTER
AB The parameters that affect the design of a hybrid rocket for small satellites are highlighted, and the benefit of the oxidizer flow rate control is analyzed. A single-port circular-section polyethylene grain is considered; the oxidizer is 85% hydrogen peroxide. The engine design is optimized to search for the minimum engine mass when the initial satellite mass and the required velocity increment are assigned. First, the simplest blowdown feed system is considered. The analysis shows that the optimal design depends on a lower limit for the regression rate and sometimes on a further constraint, which is related to the occurrence of thermal choking. The initial values of the mixture ratio, the thrust level and the initial port area to the throat area ratio seem to be the most important parameters for an optimal design. As far as the oxidizer flow rate control is concerned, several control strategies, namely, constant mixture ratio, repressurization, constant combustion chamber pressure, and constant propellant tank pressure, are compared to the simplest blowdown system. The constant mixture ratio control is the worst case, as the mass and volume are similar to the blowdown case, while a large thrust variation occurs. Repressurization reduces the thrust variation. Constant pressure controls (both combustion chamber and tank pressures) guarantee a quasi-constant thrust and reduce engine dimensions, with a limited mass penalty.

AB Dual-bell nozzles represent a possible solution to improve the performance of large liquid rocket engines for launcher first stages. The present paper studies the role of the second bell shape on the side loads that can occur during the transition between the two main operating modes of the nozzle. In particular, the design of the second bell profile is critically discussed on the basis of results obtained from suitable test cases. The analysis of performance and behavior during the transition is carried out by a.validated turbulent Navier-Stokes solver. Geometries were generated by the method of characteristics. Results show that slightly different geometries designed by the method of characteristics yield modest: performance changes but severe differences in behavior during the transition phase.

AB Saint Louis University, in conjunction with The Boeing Company, is investigating the feasibility of a wave-rider-based second stage for a two-stage-to-orbit system. This rocket-powered second stage is designed to carry 32,000 lb (14,500 kg) to orbit from a Mach 5 staging point. A wave-rider-derived shape was selected to provide increased reentry cross-range capability for more efficient operations. The process, tools, and results of an analysis of the hypersonic thermal protection system design requirements for this second stage vehicle are addressed.

DT Article
DE reliability; Bayesian analysis; launch vehicles; rockets; failure
   probability; infancy problems
AB This paper addresses the treatment of `infancy problems' in the reliability analysis of space launch systems. To that effect. we analyze the probability of failure of launch vehicles in their first five launches. We present methods and results based on a combination of Bayesian probability and frequentist statistics designed to estimate the system's reliability before the realization of a large number of launches. We show that while both approaches are beneficial, the Bayesian method is particularly useful when the experience base is small (i.e. for a new rocket). We define reliability as the probability of success based on a binary failure/no failure event WC conclude that the mean failure rates appear to be higher in the first and second flights (approximate to 1/3 and 1/4, respectively) than in subsequent ones (third, fourth and fifth), and Bayesian methods do suggest that there is indeed some difference in launch risk over the first five launches. Yet based on a classical frequentist analysis, we find that for these first few flights, the differences in the mean failure rates over successive launches of over successive generations of vehicles, are not statistically significant (i.e. do not meet a 95% confidence level). This is true because the frequentist analysis is based on a fixed confidence level (here: 95%), whereas the Bayesian one allows more flexibility in the conclusions based on a full probability density distribution of the failure rate and therefore, permits better interpretation of the information contained in a small sample. The approach also gives more insight into the considerable uncertainty in failure rate estimates based on small sample sizes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Fabrication of TBC-armored rocket combustion chambers by EB-PVD methods

SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS

DT Article
DE thermal barrier coating; transient liquid phase joining
AB A thermal barrier coating (TBC) system for rocket chambers made of Cu-based high strength alloys has been developed in a pilot project in line with EB-PVD (electron-beam physical vapor deposition) technology aiming at TBC application on Cu-based walls of real rocket combustion chambers. The TBC system consists of a metallic bond coating compatible with Cu-based material and an yttria partially stabilized zirconia TBC. The TBC overlayer is a distinctive ceramic structure designed for an exceptionally low Young's modulus to withstand the extreme mismatch stresses between the internally LN-cooled high thermal expansion Cu metal base and the low thermal expansion hot ceramic shell. The TBC system has been qualified under close-to-service conditions on cylindrical LH2-cooled combustion chamber segments, where they have performed superior. As EB-PVD technology is a line-of-sight process that is rather able to coat internal cavities, a transient liquid phase (TLP) joining technique for fully coated parts has been developed, that allows to assemble complete components out of vapor-accessible fully coated parts. It is capable, e.g. to incorporate sinuous cooling passages in the throat areas of combustion chambers, and/or to assemble oversized parts out of smaller components by maintaining parent metal properties. A manufacturing process is outlined for making internal TBC armored combustion chambers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thousands of scientific publications and dozens of textbooks include data from instruments derived from NASA's Seasat. The Seasat mission was launched on June 26, 1978, on an Atlas-Agena rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. It was the first Earth-orbiting satellite to carry four complementary microwave experitnents-the Radar Altimeter (ALT) to measure ocean surface topography by measuring spacecraft altitude above the ocean surface; the Seasat-A Satellite Scatterometer (SASS), to measure wind speed and direction over the ocean; the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) to measure surface wind speed, ocean surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor content, rain rate, and ice coverage; and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), to image the ocean surface, polar ice caps, and coastal regions. While originally designed for remote sensing of the Earth's oceans, the legacy of Seasat has had a profound impact in many other areas including solid earth science, hydrology, ecology and planetary science.

TI New Horizons Pluto-Kuiper Belt mission: design and simulation of the
   Pluto-Charon encounter
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The primary goal of the New Horizons Pluto-Kuiper Belt mission is to explore Pluto by 2020, before Pluto's atmosphere collapses as predicted by scientists, and then explore the Kuiper Belt objects in an extended mission. The baseline mission plans to launch in January 2006, using a Jupiter gravity assist trajectory to reach Pluto. The New Horizons spacecraft will arrive at Pluto as early as 2015, depending on the launch vehicle. For such a mission, whose exploration takes place during a brief flyby period after a long cruise, a thorough planning of the encounter is especially critical to the realization of optimal science observations. A detailed Pluto encounter trajectory design that achieves both solar occultation and Earth occultation by both Pluto and Charon is described in this paper, along with discussions of the design rationale and considerations. Science observations and measurements planned for the Pluto-Charon encounter are simulated and analyzed, and a comprehensive Pluto-Charon encounter process filled with detailed science observation simulations is demonstrated in a 3-D animation.

TI Modelling and validation of a propellant mixer for controller design
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
ID TRACKING
AB A mixing chamber used in rocket engine testing at the NASA Stennis Space Center is modelled by a system of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The mixer is used to condition the thermodynamic properties of cryogenic liquid propellant by controlled injection of the same substance in the gaseous phase. The three inputs of the mixer are the positions of the valves regulating the liquid and gas flows at the inlets, and the position of the exit valve regulating the flow of conditioned propellant. Mixer operation during a test requires the regulation of its internal pressure, exit mass flow, and exit temperature. A mathematical model is developed to facilitate subsequent controller designs. The model must be simple enough to lend itself to subsequent feedback controller design, yet its accuracy must be tested against real data. For this reason, the model includes function calls to thermodynamic property data. Some structural properties of the resulting model that pertain to controller design, such as uniqueness of the equilibrium point, feedback linearizability and local stability are shown to hold under conditions having direct physical interpretation. The existence of fixed valve positions that attain a desired operating condition is also shown. Validation of the model against real data is likewise provided. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A composite grid-stiffened structural concept was selected for the payload fairing of the Minotaur launch vehicle. Compared to sandwich structures, this concept has the advantages of lower manufacturing costs and lighter weight. Various failure modes were examined for the composite grid-stiffened Structure. The controlling criterion for this design was a joint failure in tension between the ribs and skin of the structure. The identification of this failure mechanism and the assessment of bounding strains required to control it required extensive test and analysis effort. Increasing skin thickness to control skin buckling resulted in reduced, strains between the skin and ribs.
   During the final steps of manufacture of this composite structure an industrial accident occur-red resulting in extensive damage to one half of the fairing. The failure modes developed during the design of the fairing were used to identify probable regions of damage and effective means of repair for this structure. Conventional ultrasound NDE confirmed that extensive disbonding of fibs and skin had occurred in portions of the damaged fairing half-shell. The resulting repair procedures were applied and the structural testing procedure was modified to insure that the repairs had minimal impact on the test results.
   The structure has passed structural flight qualification and a second unit is being prepared for launch in 2005. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation rates in Mg-like Fe XV are used to derive theoretical emission-line ratios involving transitions in the 243-418 Angstrom wavelength range. A comparison of these with a data set of solar active region, subflare and off-limb spectra, obtained during rocket flights by the Solar Extreme-Ultraviolet Research Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS), reveals generally very good agreement between theory and observation, indicating that most of the Fe XV emission lines may be employed with confidence as electron density diagnostics. In particular, the 312.55-Angstrom line of Fe XV is not significantly blended with a CoXVII transition in active region spectra, as suggested previously, although the latter does make a major contribution in the subflare observations. Most of the Fe XV transitions which are blended have had the species responsible clearly identified, although there remain a few instances where this has not been possible. We briefly address the long-standing discrepancy between theory and experiment for the intensity ratio of the 3s(21) S-3s3p P-3(1) intercombination line at 417.25 Angstrom to the 3s(21) S-3s3p P-1 resonance transition at 284.16 Angstrom.

AB The presence of a dust layer in the Earth's mesosphere is generally accepted on theoretical grounds (Hunten et al., 1980), but its experimental verification has been difficult and its influence on mesospheric dynamics and chemistry is not yet understood. Four sounding rockets carrying detectors designed to measure nanometer-sized charged dust particles were flown from Poker Flat in March 2002. Ground-based lidars were used to measure neutral sodium and iron densities during the launches in an effort to determine whether dust has an influence on mesospheric chemistry, specifically, as related to atomic Na and Fe. In situ measurements of charged dust and plasma densities were compared with the ground-based lidar data. Strong correlations between the charged dust profile and the neutral Fe profile were observed on all four flights. This finding suggests that dust serves as a reservoir for atomic iron in the mesosphere.

TI Electron density profiles in the equatorial E region ionosphere derived
   from a bistatic coherent scatter radar experiment in Peru
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE IONOSPHERE; PLASMA
AB A new bistatic radar system has been developed at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory. The system is a permanent addition to the facility designed to monitor electron density profiles in the equatorial electrojet region using a coherent scatter radar technique that utilizes the Faraday rotation of the scattered signal. A series of radar experiments has been conducted at Jicamarca since March, 2004. In this report, representative E region electron density profiles of the equatorial ionosphere are presented. We compare our electron density estimates with: theoretical electron densities derived from the Chapman production function, electron densities measured by rocket experiments, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2001) model, and peak electron density estimates from the Jicamarca Digisonde. Overall, the radar measured density profiles have magnitudes and shapes comparable to the electron density estimators mentioned above. However, the measured and IRI-2001 model density profiles disagree significantly below the E region peak.

AB The mission of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes to enable improved prediction of climate. weather. and natural hazards for present and future generations. The ESE has an end-to-end strategy to assure that information. understanding. and capabilities derived from its research program achieve maximum usefulness to the scientific and decision-making communities. Small satellites (< 500 kg) have been crucial contributors to satisfying the research strategy since the inception of NASA's Earth observation program in the 1960s. In the last decade, NASA's ESE has placed a renewed emphasis on small satellites. This reemphasis reflects advancements in compact sensor, small satellite bus. and launch vehicle technologies in addition to management innovations. Near term and advanced planning suggest that this trend will continue. A number of related small satellite missions have been recently launched, are in development. or are planned. Multi-satellite constellations under study include small satellites as key architectural elements. Studies indicate that low cost. capable microspacecraft along with compact sensors and increased autonomy are technology enablers to the sensorwebs and associated distributed spacecraft infrastructure required to realize the long-term NASA Earth Science Vision (ESV).

TI Dual-band infrared imagery of an atlas 5 launch vehicle in flight
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Imagery acquired with a quantum-well infrared photodetector dual-band infrared focal plane array of the inaugural launch of the Atlas 5 launch vehicle is presented. The focal plane array was developed under the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Advanced Sensors Federated Laboratory program and used a read-out integrated circuit produced under the Air Force Research Laboratory's Advanced Multi-Quantum Well Technology program. The detectors are able to sense light in both the 3-5- and 8-12-mum atmospheric transmission windows such that the resulting single-band images are pixel registered and simultaneous. The focal plane array was installed in a camera system that used a closed-cycle cooler to operate at 60 K. The camera was placed at the prime focus of an all-reflective telescope on a computer-controlled tracking mount at the Innovative Sensor Technology Evaluation Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. The launch was observed from a distance of 15 kin from the pad. The dual-band camera system was calibrated using standard blackbody sources. The launch vehicle was observed from about 30 s after launch until approximately 4 min after launch. This corresponded to ranges between 15 km and more than 300 km and altitudes from just over 1 km to more than 100 km. Several interesting differences in the structure of the plume were observed. In addition, the hardbody of the rocket was seen in the 8-12-mum imagery but was undetectable in the 3-5-mum imagery. The imagery was unsaturated in both bands allowing us to obtain good measurements of the radiance of the plume in both the principal infrared bands.

AB It is well known that among the first motivations for modem control theory were dynamic optimization problems in rocket launching and navigation in aerospace. These problems had become especially important in the 1940s and 1950s due to requirement to minimize various costly resources and design parameters, such as flight time, amount (mass) of fuel, weight of the spacecraft, the drag forces and other items. This had to be done under various restrictions on control capacities and other complicating factors, such for example, as incomplete information on the system. Among the precious techniques of applied mathematics there had long been developed an adequate too] for such problems which is the Calculus of Variations. Problems in flight dynamics had become the earliest serious technical object for its application. A large number of new basic ideas for adapting Calculus of Variations to modern control problems and synthesizing them into modern control theory were elaborated in the course of investigations in flight dynamics. This presentation traces some seminal investigations, which were crucial for related theoretical developments, in former Soviet Union and present Russia and had also influenced related research beyond national borders. Such investigations had good historical precursors in the earlier mathematical works of P.L. Chebyshev, A.M. Lyapunov, A.A. Markov, the works in mechanics by N.E. Zhukovski and S.A. Chaplygin and the activities in dynamic systems theory of the 1930s (A.A. Andronov, L.S. Pontryagin, et al.).
   The present paper is confined only to deterministic problems in trajectory analysis, control and optimization within the framework of mathematical theory of controlled processes. The national community of researchers involved in these topics was enormous, including those in the Academy of Sciences, the Universities and the numerous institutions and plants supervised by related industrial ministries. While giving tribute to all those involved, this paper does not claim to give a full review of available publications, concentrating on what the authors believe to be the seminal issues in the field. This publication will therefore inevitably have a subjective flavor. We sincerely apologize to all those whose contributions may have been missed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that among the first motivations for modem control theory were dynamic optimization problems in rocket launching and navigation in aerospace. These problems had become especially important in the 1940s and 1950s due to requirement to minimize various costly resources and design parameters, such as flight time, amount (mass) of fuel, weight of the spacecraft, the drag forces and other items. This had to be done under various restrictions on control capacities and other complicating factors, such for example, as incomplete information on the system. Among the precious techniques of applied mathematics there had long been developed an adequate too] for such problems which is the Calculus of Variations. Problems in flight dynamics had become the earliest serious technical object for its application. A large number of new basic ideas for adapting Calculus of Variations to modern control problems and synthesizing them into modern control theory were elaborated in the course of investigations in flight dynamics. This presentation traces some seminal investigations, which were crucial for related theoretical developments, in former Soviet Union and present Russia and had also influenced related research beyond national borders. Such investigations had good historical precursors in the earlier mathematical works of P.L. Chebyshev, A.M. Lyapunov, A.A. Markov, the works in mechanics by N.E. Zhukovski and S.A. Chaplygin and the activities in dynamic systems theory of the 1930s (A.A. Andronov, L.S. Pontryagin, et al.).
   The present paper is confined only to deterministic problems in trajectory analysis, control and optimization within the framework of mathematical theory of controlled processes. The national community of researchers involved in these topics was enormous, including those in the Academy of Sciences, the Universities and the numerous institutions and plants supervised by related industrial ministries. While giving tribute to all those involved, this paper does not claim to give a full review of available publications, concentrating on what the authors believe to be the seminal issues in the field. This publication will therefore inevitably have a subjective flavor. We sincerely apologize to all those whose contributions may have been missed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The design of new Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) involves a full set of disciplines - propulsion, structural sizing, aerodynamics, mission analysis, flight control, stages layout - with strong interaction between each other. Since multidisciplinary design optimization of multistage launch vehicles is a complex and computationally expensive. An efficient Least Square Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR) technique is used for trajectory simulation of multistage space launch vehicle. This newly formulation problem-about 17 parameters, linked to both the architecture and the command (trajectory optimization), 8 constraints - is solved through hybrid optimization algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as global optimizer and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) as local optimizer starting from the solution given by (PSO). The objective is to find minimum gross launch weight (GLW) and optimal trajectory during launch maneuvering phase for liquid fueled space launch vehicle (SLV). The computational cost incurred is compared for two cases of conceptual design involving exact trajectory simulation and with Least Square Support Vector Regression based trajectory simulation.

TI Propulsion of space ships by nuclear explosion
SO COSMIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent progress in the research on deuterium-tritium (D-T) inertially confined microexplosions encourages one to reconsider the nuclear propulsion of spaceships based on the concept originally proposed in the Orion project. We discuss first the acceleration of medium-sized spaceships by D-T explosions whose output is in the range of 0.1-10 t of TNT. The launching of such a ship into an Earth orbit or beyond by a large nuclear explosion in an underground cavity is sketched out in the second section of the paper, and finally we consider a hypothetical Mars mission based on these concepts. In the conclusion it is argued that propulsion based on the Orion concept only is not the best method for interplanetary travel owing to the very large number of nuclear explosion required. A combination of a super gun and subsequent rocket propulsion using advanced chemical fuels appears to be the best solution for space flights of the near future.

AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. Given mission objective is to launch 7.5kg nano-satellite to the target orbit of 700km x 700kni using the mother plane, F-4E Phantom. The launching altitude and velocity are 12km, Mach number 1.5, respectively. As the propulsion system, a hybrid rocket engine is used for the first stage, and the solid rocket motors are used for the second and third stages. The total mass, length and diameter constraints of the rocket are imposed by the mother plane. The system design has been performed using the sequential optimization method. Gradient based SQP(Sequential Quadratic Programming) algorithm is employed. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis, configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1272.61kg, total length of 6.43m, outer diameter of 0.60 m and the payload mass of 7.5kg has been successfully designed.

ID TEMPERATURE-MEASUREMENTS; SIMULTANEOUS VELOCITY; EXPANSION
AB The present work is concerned with numerical simulation of turbulent cold flow in a dump combustor using Fluent commercial code. The understanding of complex flow field in this kind of combustor is very useful for designing and developing the Ramjet engine, rocket engine, and gas turbine engine. The present computations were based on numerical solution of time averaged Navier-Stokes equations with an eddy-viscosity turbulence closure using two equation models. Results were compared with experimental data for the validation of the code. The effects of various flow, parameters such as inlet Reynolds number, inlet turbulence intensity and expansion on important flow quantities like axial velocity, radial velocity, static pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate have been studied extensively. Inlet turbulence intensity is found to be the dominant parameter determining the flow field. However this effect diminishes with increase in the expansion ratio. Increase in turbulence intensity enhances the level of turbulence and in turn increases the magnitude of axial and radial velocities inside the recirculation region. This helps in reducing the reattachment length, which facilitates in attaining uniform flow at a shorter axial distance. The increase of turbulence level decreases the reattachment length due to the energy supply to the separating shear layer, which is a major factor determining the reattachment length. It has been found out that for same expansion ratio, the reattachment length attains a minimum value for low Reynolds number, increases with increase in Reynolds number, and reaches, a maximum limit. It is also observed from axial velocity results that inlet Reynolds number is not an important parameter governing the flow field. From static pressure data, it is clear that maximum pressure recovery occurs only for downstream of the reattachment point.

AB The reusable launch vehicle thrust cell liner, or thrust chamber, is a critical component of the space shuttle main engine. It is designed to operate in some of the most severe conditions seen in engineering practice. These conditions give rise to characteristic deformations of the cooling channel wall exposed to high thermal gradients and a coolant-induced pressure differential, characterized by the wall's bulging and thinning, which ultimately lead to experimentally observed "dog-house" failure modes. In this paper, these deformations are modeled using the cylindrical version of the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials in conjunction with two inelastic constitutive models for the liner's constituents, namely Robinson's unified viscoplasticity theory and the power-law creep model. Comparison of the results based on these two constitutive models under cyclic thermomechanical loading demonstrates that, for the employed constitutive model parameters, the power-law creep model predicts more precisely the experimentally observed deformation leading to the "dog-house" failure mode for multiple short cycles, while also providing much improved computational efficiency. The differences in the two models' predictions are rooted in the differences in the short-term creep and relaxation responses.

ID SPACECRAFT
AB A yo-yo-type wire-boom deployment system has been developed and flight tested on a sounding rocket mission. The goal of the work has been to validate a new mechanism that rapidly deploys wire booms from a spinning spacecraft. This work takes a theoretical system design and implements it in practical hardware. The limitations inherent in practical hardware necessitated new theoretical developments. A modified stability analysis has been developed for the case of nonzero axial separation between the wire-boom base attachment points and the spacecraft's center of mass. This modified stability analysis dictates that a stable design is impractical for many missions because very large wire-boom tip masses are needed and because the three-dimensional deployment transients are very sensitive to small asymmetries. This problem has led to the development of design criteria and analysis techniques, which permit a short-duration mission to use a slightly unstable notation mode. These techniques have been used to design a system that has been flown on two daughter, spacecraft that were part of a formation of three sounding rocket subpayloads. Each daughter spacecraft deployed four 3-m-long wire booms in under 10 s and maintained a low level of spin instability for the remaining 700 s of the mission. The notation oscillations showed a slow exponential growth, but the coning half-angles of both spacecraft never exceeded 16 deg.

AB In this paper, a study of the high-speed gas jet of a rocket nozzle underwater was carried out using commercially available CFD software FLUENT with it's user-defined-function. The volume of fluid technique based on finite volume method was adopted to solve the time-dependent multiphase flow including a compressible phase, and the PISO algorithm was included. The computed results show that this problem was calculated successfully. The gas bubble behind the nozzle, and the wave structure existing in highly compressed gas in water were captured accurately.

TI Rheological behavior of nitromethane gelled with nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB Gel propellants provide rocket propulsion systems of high specific impulse, low sensitivity, and low vulnerability in combination with the capability to control the thrust, that is, variation of thrust and thrust cutoff. The rheological characterization is essential for the development of adequate gel propellant formulations and, thus, for the design of an applicable propulsion system. The rheological behavior of a gel propellant consisting of nitromethane as fuel and nanoparticles of silicon dioxide as gelling agent was examined. The experiments were conducted under steady-state shear flow and oscillatory shear. The nitromethane/silicon dioxide gels exhibit non-Newtonian flow behavior over the whole concentration range examined. Additionally, a yield stress is determined for all of the gels. The viscoelastic properties are typically gellike in that the storage and the loss moduli are both independent of frequency.

TI Optimal design of two-stage-to-orbit space planes with airbreathing
   engines
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
AB Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. Our aim in this study is to apply an optimization method for conceptual designs of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) space planes with airbreathing engines on the first-stage boosters and to obtain necessary vehicle sizes and their optimal flight trajectories. First, we integrate analysis methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yield the minimized total dry mass of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO space plane. The optimal solutions show that TSTO space planes with boosters powered by rocket engines added to the airbreathing engines are lighter in total dry mass than vehicles with boosters propelled by only airbreathing engines. However, it is necessary to lighten and miniaturize vehicle components to achieve greater feasibility. In addition, the trajectory optimizations enable the booster to glide back to a launch site using little propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory. This study confirms that the analysis and optimization method proposed are effective.

AB The goal of the methods and project example described is to use analysis to get more out of an engine qualification program. Nonlinearities are one of the reasons that testing is important in final validation of engine designs. An efficient method of modeling discrete nonlinearities was used to extend the understanding and value of both the sinusoidal vibration testing and the linear dynamic analysis that had been done before testing. In the example, discrete nonlinear elements are identified and separated from the overall engine finite element model. The nonlinear system is solved in a multibody dynamic program with the bulk of the engine represented by its modes. Final data recovery for the engine components is done within a linear, dynamic analysis program using the modal time histories from the multibody program.

AB An advanced study on the thermal behaviour of double base (boost and sustain propellant) rocket motor used in a ground to air missile has been carried out by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The presence of two propellants as well as the different experimental conditions (open vs. closed crucibles) influence the relative thermal stability of the energetic materials. Several methods have been presented for predictions of the reaction progress of exothermic reactions under adiabatic conditions. However, because decomposition reactions usually have a multi-step nature, the accurate determination of the kinetic characteristics strongly influences the ability to correctly describe the progress of the reaction. For self-heating reactions, incorrect kinetic description of the process is usually the main source of serious errors for the determination of the time to maximum rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRad). It is hazardous to develop safety predictive models that are based on simplified kinetics determined by thermoanalytical methods. Applications of finite element analysis (FEA) and accurate kinetic description allow determination of the effect of scale, geometry, heat transfer, thermal conductivity and ambient temperature on the heat accumulation conditions. Due to limited thermal conductivity, a progressive temperature increase in the sample can easily take place resulting in a thermal explosion. Use of both, kinetics and FEA [1], enables the determination of the reaction progress and temperature profiles in storage containers. The reaction progress and temperature can be determined quantitatively at every point in time and in space. This information is essential for the design of containers of self-reactive chemicals, cooling systems and the measures to be taken in the event of a cooling failure.

AB The term, propulsion breakthrough, refers to concepts like propel-lantless space drives and faster-than-light travel, the kind of breakthroughs that would make interstellar exploration practical. Although no such breakthroughs appear imminent, a variety of investigations have begun. During 1996-2002 NASA supported the breakthrough propulsion physics project to examine physics in the context of breakthrough spaceflight. Three facets of these assessments are now reported: (1) predicting benefits, (2) selecting research, and (3) recent technical progress. Predicting benefits is challenging, since the breakthroughs are still only notional concepts, but energy can serve as a basis for comparison. A hypothetical space drive would require many orders of magnitude less energy than a rocket for journeys to our nearest neighboring star. Assessing research options is challenging when the goals are beyond known physics and when the implications of success are profound. To mitigate the challenges, a selection process is described where: (1) research tasks are constrained to only address the immediate unknowns, curious effects, or critical issues; (2) reliability of assertions is more important than their implications; and (3) reviewers judge credibility rather than feasibility. The recent findings of a number of tasks, some selected using this process, are discussed. Of the 14 tasks included, six reached null conclusions, four remain unresolved, and four have opportunities for sequels. A dominant theme with the sequels is research about the properties of space, inertial frames, and the quantum vacuum.

AB An efficient and reliable pressurization system for an oxidizer and fuel of a liquid propellant rocket is critical for a successful launch. A liquid helium pressurization system employing a heater can reduce its mass, and be made simpler and more reliable than conventional pressurization systems. The key issue to minimize the total mass of the system is the optimization of the size of the liquid helium tank. In this paper, we describe a method to determine the optimal size of a liquid helium tank, and present one set of results under a given set of requirements. In this pressurization system, the heater design is represented by the heater efficiency. To estimate the heater efficiency, the convection heat transfer coefficient should be known beforehand. The guideline how to estimate this convection heat transfer coefficient based on the preliminary experimental data is also presented in this paper.

AB Prediction of the regression rate of polymeric fuels is important, especially for the optimal design of solid fuel ramjets or hybrid rocket motors. The burning surface temperature and the surface activation energy in the Arrhenius pyrolysis equation are required for prediction of the regression rate. As a typical polymeric fuel, polymethylinethacrylate (PMMA) was chosen for the present study. The burning surface temperature of PMMA was measured for both end-burning and sandwich-burning experimental devices. In the end-burning experiment, the oxygen flow impinged on the top of the specimen to burn the PMMA. In the sandwich-burning experiment, PMMA sheets were sandwiched between AP pellets. Temperature profiles near the burning surface were measured with a thermocouple embedded in the specimen. Simultaneously. the emergence of the thermocouple from the burning surface was determined with a video camera. The burning surface temperature obtained in the present Study was found to be almost independent of the regression rate. The Surface activation energy of PMMA was more than 1000 kJ/mol. Our measured surface temperature or the activation energy differs from the values measured with a thermocouple in previous studies. This difference probably is a result of mistaken identification of the burning surface temperature in the previous Studies. because it was found that the sudden change or tiny plateau of the slope, in the temperature profile of PMMA, did not signal the burning surface.

   PROBLEMS
AB A major challenge to the successful full-scale development of modern aerospace systems is to address competing objectives such as improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. Accurate, high-fidelity models are typically time consuming and computationally expensive. Furthermore, informed decisions should be made with an understanding of the impact (global sensitivity) of the design variables on the different objectives. In this context, the so-called surrogate-based approach for analysis and optimization can play a very valuable role. The surrogates are constructed using data drawn from high-fidelity models, and provide fast approximations of the objectives and constraints at new design points, thereby making sensitivity and optimization studies feasible. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental issues that arise in surrogate-based analysis and optimization (SBAO), highlighting concepts, methods, techniques, as well as practical implications. The issues addressed include the selection of the loss function and regularization criteria for constructing the surrogates, design of experiments, surrogate selection and construction, sensitivity analysis, convergence, and optimization. The multi-objective optimal design of a liquid rocket injector is presented to highlight the state of the art and to help guide future efforts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our current ways of observing the Sun with spectrometers and imagers are limited. With a slit spectrometer, we require time to build Lip a 2-D image which results in temporal blurring. When we use a traditional imager, we have no ability to measure and detect line-of-sight flows or to discriminate contributions from gas at different temperatures in the imager passband, causing spectral confusion of the images. For Solar Orbiter, the combination of an exciting new viewpoint of the Sun, and the best resolution of the corona ever seen, means that we require the best time cadence and velocity information that we can get. The spatial resolution expected from the imager on Solar Orbiter will reach approximately 70 km. At such a resolution in the corona, we expect to see the fundamental magnetic flux tubes, which are predicted to have high velocities. This is also the scale at which we will be able to search for evidence basic physical processes such as magnetic reconnection. We will describe the design of an imager that gives not only high quality images, but also provides simultaneous information about plasma flows and temperature. A prototype instrument is being flown on a NASA sounding rocket next year. The concept will be described, along with some methods of extracting the spectroscopic information.

DE space debris; mitigation; geosynchronous transfer orbit
AB Missions to geosynchronous orbits remain one of the most important elements of space launch traffic, accounting for 40% of all missions to Earth orbit and beyond during the four-year period 2000-2003. The vast majority of these missions leave one or more objects in geosynchronous transfer orbits (GTOs), contributing oil a short-term or long-term basis to the space debris population. National and international space debris mitigation guidelines seek to curtail the accumulation of debris in orbits which penetrate the regions of low Earth orbit and of geosynchronous orbit. The orbital lifetime of objects in GTO can be greatly influenced by the initial values of perigee, inclination, and right ascension of the orbital plane, leading to orbital lifetimes of from less than one month to more than 100 years. An examination of the characteristic GTOs employed by launch vehicles from around the world has been conducted. The consequences of using perigees above 300 km and super-synchronous apogees, typically above 40,000 km, have been identified. In addition, the differences in orbital behavior of launch vehicle stages and mission-related debris in GTOs have been investigated. Greater coordination and cooperation between space launch service providers and spacecraft designers and owners could significantly improve overall compliance with guidelines to mitigate the accumulation of debris in Earth orbit.

AB Critical design parameters on the performance prediction of converging nozzles are the geometric features and the operating conditions, which include the stagnant properties at the inlet, frictional and heat transfer behaviors on the nozzle wall; where the latter two are hard to handle together in compressible high-speed flows. This paper presents a recent computational model, that integrates the axisymmetric continuity, momentum and energy equations, to predict the combined effects of surface roughness and heat flux conditions on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of compressible flows through converging nozzles. To build a comprehensive overview, analyses are conducted at convergence half angles from 0 degrees to 9 degrees and inlet stagnation to back pressure ratios ranged from 1.01 to 2, covering both the un-choked and choked cases. Non-dimensional surface roughness and surface heat flux values are in the order of 0.0025-0.05 and 20-2000 kW/m(2) respectively. The influences of the model parameters on the nozzle performance are discussed through the streamwise variations of Mach number, shear stress, discharge coefficient and Nusselt number; to verify the validity of the model comparisons are made with the numerical and experimental data available in the literature.

ID RESISTANCE
AB Thermal shock is a physical phenomenon that occurs during the exposure to rapidly high temperature and pressure changes or during quenching of a material. The rocket nozzle throat is exposed to combustion gas of high temperature. Therefore, it is important to select suitable materials having the appropriate thermal shock resistance and to evaluate these materials for rocket nozzle design. The material of this study is ATJ graphite, which is the candidate material for rocket nozzle throat. This study presents an experimental method to evaluate the thermal shock resistance and thermal shock fracture toughness of ATJ graphite using laser irradiation. In particular, thermal shock resistance tests are conducted with changes of specimen thickness, with laser source irradiated at the center of the specimen. Temperature distributions on the specimen surface are detected using type K and C thermocouples. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to observe the thermal cracks on specimen surface.

AB Irene Bredt (b.1911 at Bonn) obtained her Doctorate in Physics in 1937; in the same year she became a scientific researcher at the German Research Center for Aviation at Trauen, led by Prof Dr. Eugen Sanger. Soon, the young but efficient Dr. Irene Bredt became the first assistant of Dr. Sanger, who married her (1951). During 1973-1978, Dr. Bredt was in correspondence with Prof Dr. Nikolae-Florin Zaganescu and helped him to familiarize the Romanian readers with Prof. Sanger's life and achievements. As for Dr. Bredt's life, she specified three main periods of her activity: 1937-1942, when she was researcher in charge of thermodynamic problems of liquid-fuelled rocket engines at Trauen 1942-1945, when she was Senior Researcher in charge of Ramjet in flight performances at Ainring, and also coauthored the Top Secret Technical report entitled 'A Rocket Engine for a Long-Range Bomber', which was finished in 1941 but edited only in 1944 the post world war II period, when she was Scientific Advisor or Director at various civil and military research institutes, universities, etc. Dr. Irene Sanger-Bredt helped her husband to develop many scientific theories like Ramjet thermodynamic theory, and photon rocket theory and also in establishing IAF and IAA. In 1970, Dr. Irene Sanger-Bredt was honored with 'Hermann Oberth Gold Medal' for her impressive scientific activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present research describes the symptoms of infection of Cladosporium tenuissimum on cucumber fruits. This infection induced formation of numerous small circular swellings (3.3 mm diameter by 1.8 mm high) on the surface of infected fruits rendering them unfit for marketing purposes. No previous description of these symptoms on cucumber fruits has been reported. Results obtained on susceptibility of the locally common-cultivated cucumber cultivars to the infection indicated significant differences in cultivar susceptibility. Cultivar Nour was the most susceptible whereas Rocket and Ringo were the least susceptible. Other tested cultivars were intermediate. Treatment of the infection on cultivar Nour with fungicides indicated significant reduction in number of C. tenuissimum swellings per cm 2 of infected fruit surface in comparison with the untreated control. Score(R) ( difenoconazole) applied at a rate of 0.35% v/v and Merpan(R) (captan) applied at a rate of 0.35% w/v demonstrated as the most effective among tested fungicides with 83% to 86% reduction in the number of disease swellings relative to the control.

AB Active vibration control using piezoelectric actuators in a networked and embedded environment has been widely applied to solve the rocket fairing vibration problem. However, actuator failures may lead to performance deterioration or system dysfunction. To guarantee the desired system performance, the remaining actuators should be able to coordinate with each other to compensate for the damaging effects caused by the failed actuator in a timely manner. Further, in the networked control environment, timing issues such as sampling jitter and network-induced delay should be considered in the controller design. In this study, a timing compensation approach is implemented in an adaptive actuator failure compensation controller to maintain the fairing system performance by also considering the detrimental effects from real-time constraints. In addition, time-delay compensation in the networked control system is discussed, which is able to reduce damaging effects of network-induced delays.

TI Computational analysis of an independent ramjet stream in a combined

SO AIAA JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SCHEME
AB A new concept for the low-speed propulsion mode in rocket-based combined cycle engines has been developed as part of the NASA GTX program. This concept, called the independent ramjet stream (IRS) cycle, is a variation of the traditional ejector ramjet (ER) design and involves the injection of hydrogen fuel directly into the airstream, where it is ignited by the rocket plume. The advantage of the IRS design is that it allows for a single large rocket instead of several smaller rockets, and its required combustor length is smaller than that of a traditional ER design. Both of these features make the IRS design lighter. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics are currently being used to evaluate the feasibility of the new design. In this work, a Navier-Stokes code valid for general reactive flows is applied to the model engine under cold-flow, ER, and IRS cycle operation. Pressure distributions corresponding to cold-flow and ER operation are compared with experimental data. The engine response under IRS cycle operation is examined for different reaction models and grid sizes. The solutions exhibit a high sensitivity to both grid resolution and reaction mechanism but do indicate that thermal throat ramjet operation is possible through the injection and burning of additional fuel into the airstream.

AB This article describes the science to be pursued during the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) Mission of the Air Force Research Laboratory. The primary purpose of C/NOFS is to forecast the presence of ionospheric irregularities that adversely impact communication and navigation systems. A satellite, scheduled for launch in May 2005 into a low inclination (13degrees), elliptical (similar to 375 x 710 km) orbit, is the most significant component of the C/NOFS program. Complementary ground-based measurements are also critical to the success of the mission.
   C/NOFS science objectives may be organized into three categories: (1) to understand physical processes active in the background ionosphere and thermosphere in which plasma instabilities grow; (2) to identify mechanisms that trigger or quench the plasma irregularities responsible for signal degradation; and (3) to determine how the plasma irregularities affect the propagation of electro-magnetic waves.
   C/NOFS is the first satellite solely dedicated to forecasting ionospheric irregularities and radio wave scintillations. It will be equipped with sensors that measure the following parameters: ambient and fluctuating electron densities; ion and electron temperatures; AC and DC electric fields; magnetic fields; neutral winds; ionospheric scintillations; and electron content along the lines of sight between C/NOFS and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Thus, the sensor suite on C/NOFS is richer than on any previously flown equatorial satellite. A broad range of ground-based measurements will complement the space data. In addition, data from several other satellites and rocket experiments will augment the C/ NOFS observations. Several campaigns are planned to validate operational forecasts, acquire data to achieve the science goals, and test the theoretical models.
   We anticipate that by the end of the C/NOFS mission, our understanding of the physics controlling the equatorial ionosphere will have advanced to the point that we will be able to nowcast and forecast the formation of ionospheric irregularities to a high degree of accuracy. However, this is not an easy task because a 2-6 h forecast is required, as well as an extended prediction-a three-day "outlook". Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID AUTOPILOT DESIGN
AB Current flight control of reusable launch vehicles is based on table look-up gains for specific flight conditions. A new suboptimal nonlinear control technique for the complete ascent phase of reusable launch vehicles is presented. The new technique, called the theta-D method, is synthesized by adding perturbations to a typical optimal control formulation with a quadratic cost function. The controller expressions are obtained by getting an approximate closed-form solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Beliman equation. The theta-D method avoids iterative online solutions. A controller using this new method has been designed for the ascent phase of a reusable launch vehicle and implemented in a six-degrees-of-freedom high-fidelity simulator being run at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Simulation results show that the theta-D controller achieves accurate tracking for the ascent phase of the reusable launch vehicle while being robust to external disturbances and plant uncertainties.

AB Recent research at Stanford University has led to the identification of a class of paraffin-based fuels that burn at surface regression rates that are three to four times that of conventional hybrid fuels. The approach involves the use of materials that form a thin, hydrodynamically unstable liquid layer on the melting surface of the fuel. Entrainment of droplets from the liquid-gas interface substantially increases the rate of fuel mass transfer, leading to much higher surface regression rates than can be achieved with conventional polymeric fuels. Thus, high regression rate is a natural attribute of the fuel material, and the use of oxidizing additives or other regression rate enhancement schemes is not required. The high regression rate hybrid removes the need for a complex multiport grain, and most applications up to large boosters can be designed with a single port configuration. The fuel contains no toxic or hazardous components and can be shipped by commercial freight as a nonhazardous commodity. At the present time, grains up to 0.19 m [19.1 cm (7.5 in.)] in diameter and 1.14 m [114.8 cm (45.2 in.)] long are fabricated in a general-purpose laboratory at Stanford University. To further demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a series of scale-up tests with gaseous oxygen have been carried out using a new Hybrid Combustion Facility (HCF) at NASA Ames Research Center. Data from these tests are in agreement with the small-scale, low-pressure, and low mass flux laboratory tests at Stanford University and confirm the high regression rate behavior of the fuels at chamber pressures and mass fluxes representative of commercial applications.

A numerical study of anomalous physico-chemical processes was carried out. Calculation results show that anomalous modes of ignition (which are accompanied by intense shock waves in the high-loading-density SPS combustion chamber) are extremely dangerous. The calculations demonstrate that the anomalous physicochemical processes in the SPS can be prevented.

AB Radiative heat transfer is the dominant mode of heat transfer in many engineering problems, including combustion chambers, space, greenhouses, rocket plume sensing, among others. The aim of this study is to develop an efficient method capable of eliminating ray effects in complex 2D situations and to use the developed code for other problems including combined conduction and convection in connection with CFD codes. A complete genuinely multidimensional discretization in two-dimensional discrete ordinates method is formulated to solve radiative heat transfer in a rectangular enclosure composed of diffusely emitting and reflecting boundaries and containing homogeneous media that absorbs, emits and scatters radiation. A new genuinely multidimensional differencing scheme is used to solve the radiative transfer equation with S-4, S-6, S-8, T-6, T-7, T-8 and T-9 angular quadrature schemes. Different cases are analyzed and the results are compared when possible with those obtained by others researchers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While expansion deflection (ED) nozzles have traditionally been considered primarily for use as altitude compensating devices to improve the performance of single stage to orbit vehicles, they also offer the potential for enhancing high altitude propulsion systems. If intended to only operate in near vacuum conditions, the complexity of analysis and inherent risks involved in the ED concept are greatly reduced. An integrated approach to the design and performance analysis of such nozzles is presented, comprising a mixture of computational fluid dynamics, the method of characteristics, and a semi-empirical model to allow full analysis of the closed wake flow-field of an ED nozzle. While it is demonstrated that the influence of the parameters used to define the throat region is critical to the successful application of the ED nozzle, it is also shown that with careful design the weight savings possible are significant. The analysis method itself is flexible and rapid, and lends itself well to incremental improvements in accuracy as the flow under consideration becomes better understood.

AB An important step in the design and verification process of spacecraft structures is the coupled dynamic analysis with the launch vehicle in the low-frequency domain. To reduce the costs of computation, the spacecraft and launcher models are dynamically reduced. The recovery of physical responses from the reduced system solution by means of the mode displacement method can be improved by using the mode acceleration method, which accounts for the effect of modal truncation. A further improvement can be obtained by the application of the modal truncation augmentation method, which augments the reduction transformation matrix with a set of pseudoeigenvectors. A drawback of this method is the high number of pseudoeigenvectors for substructure models with a high number of degrees of freedom at the interface. To overcome this problem a solution is provided to reduce the number of pseudoeigenvectors. The aforementioned recovery methods will be compared with regards to the obtained accuracy, specifically for substructure models with applied loads at the internal degrees of freedom (internal loads). For this purpose, the modal truncation augmentation method is further refined by using additional pseudoeigenvectors associated with the internal loads. It is shown that the accuracy obtained with the modal truncation augmentation method is superior to the other recovery methods, whereas the recovery equations remain as simple as possible.

AB The Air Force Research Laboratory's Space Vehicle Directorate (AFRL/VS) has established a customer focused composite tankage development program that is targeted to existing and future aerospace applications. AFRL/VS is developing a wide range of tank concepts that include linerless cryogenic tankage, self-healing cryogenic tankage, hydrogen peroxide compatible tankage, volumetrically efficient toroidal (donut shaped) geometries, and more.
   This paper will summarize the Upper Stage Flight Experiment (USFE) composite integral structure development effort. The integral structure refers to the stage skirt and the propellant tankage. These two parts are bonded together to form an integral structure. The USFE tank is the world's first composite, common-bulkhead, medium-pressure vessel designed to be Class I Compatible with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Lightweight hydrogen peroxide compatible tankage development is becoming increasingly important to the international aerospace community because it provides considerable benefits. Peroxide can be stored unpressurized and is relatively non-toxic, which makes it safer to handle and store compared to oxidizers such as hydrazine. In addition to being a viable bi-propellant oxidizer, hydrogen peroxide can also serve as a monopropellant for an attitude control system (ACS). Peroxide is not cryogenic, therefore, it does not require an on-board cryocooler, which makes it easier to meet mass budgets and to mitigate technical risk. Storability and ease of handling make high concentration hydrogen peroxide an ideal propellant for reusable launch vehicle (RLV) responsive upper stage applications. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A composite grid-stiffened structure concept was selected for the payload fairing of the Minotaur launch vehicle. Compared to sandwich structures, this concept has an advantage of smaller manufacturing costs and lighter weight. To reduce weight the skin pockets are allowed to buckle visibly up to about 0.5 cm peak displacement.
   Various failure modes were examined for the composite grid-stiffened structure. The controlling criterion for this design was a joint failure in tension between the ribs and skin of the structure. The identification of this failure mechanism and the assessment of bounding strains required to control it required extensive test and analysis effort. Increasing skin thickness to control skin buckling resulted in reduced strains between the skin and ribs.
   Following the identification of the relevant failure criteria, a final design for the fairing was generated. The resulting 6 in tall fairing was constructed of a tow-placed carbon fiber composite grid structure that was over-wrapped to create a laminated skin. Upon completion of curing and machining, the fairing was cut in half to create the classic "clam-shell" fairing. Static qualification testing demonstrated the structural integrity of the fairing, thereby proving the design and manufacturing process. Loads were applied incrementally in a static loading scenario. The applied load envelope exceeded worst-case dynamic flight conditions with an added safety factor of 25%. At peak load the fairing maintained structural integrity while remaining within the required displacement envelope for payload safety.
   Data were collected during the test from a variety of sensors including traditional displacement transducers and strain gages. In addition, full field displacement was monitored at critically loaded fairing sections by means of digital photogrammetry. This paper summarizes the test results, presents the overall performance of the fairing under the test loads, correlates test response and analysis, and identifies lessons learned.
   Work continues at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Boeing to identify means of further controlling tensile failure of the un-reinforced polymer bonded joint between the ribs and skin. Stiffening of skin adjacent to the joints and introduction of lightweight foam jackets at the interior of the fairing both show promise of delaying joint failure to higher loads.

AB The actuator failure compensation problem is formulated for active vibration control of a rocket fairing structural-acoustic model with unknown actuator failures. Performance of a nominal optimal control scheme in the presence of actuator failures is studied to show the need of effective failure compensation. A robust control scheme and two adaptive control schemes are developed, which are able to ensure the closed-loop system signal boundedness in the presence of actuator failures whose failure pattern and values are unknown. The adaptive scheme for parameterizable failures ensures asymptotic stability despite failure uncertainties. Simulation results verified their failure compensation effectiveness.

AB Numerical simulations have been performed to assess the nonlinear, unsteady behavior of fuel jets emanating from an injector in the presence of a transverse (tangential) acoustic wave. Conditions for the simulations have been set to pertain to injector designs used during the development of the F-1 liquid rocket engine. Results indicate that injector designs which were unstable have substantial coupling between the acoustic wave and the natural frequency of oscillation of the fuel column emanating from the orifice. This instability scenario is discussed in the context of other theories offered as explanation for F-1 instabilities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The European Agency under its Aurora programme is about to undertake bold and unprecedented steps towards exploring the outer planets of our solar system. A very important step in this programme is a Mars sample return mission lead by the European Space Agency. One main point in this mission is transporting samples from mars with and without humans back to Earth. Transporting these samples and humans from the hostile Mars environment to low Mars orbit and then back to Earth will require some means of transportation based on rockets. In this respect the Surrey Space Centre is exploring alternatives to design a low cost, modular Planetary Ascent Vehicle (PAV). This paper will briefly describe the following:
   Sizing and systems design of a Mars Ascent Vehicle
   Issues on the design of the Navigation, Guidance and Control System of a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV).

TI Optimal conceptual design of two-stage reusable rocket vehicles
   including trajectory optimization
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
ID GENERATION; LAUNCHERS
AB Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. This paper applies an optimization method for conceptual designs of winged fully reusable rocket two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicles in both horizontal takeoff and vertical launch styles. We first describe our methods for analyzing vehicle design. Then we integrate those methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yields the minimized parameter, defined as the total gross weight of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO vehicle. The optimal solutions show the necessity of lightening and miniaturizing components. Vertical launch vehicles are lighter in total gross weight than horizontal takeoff vehicles. In addition to optimizing vehicle configuration, this study also optimizes ascent and return trajectories. These optimizations enable the booster to glide back to the launch site without propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory.

AB Development of dynamic environments in the initial phase of launch vehicle design is a challenging task. Acoustic, vibration,and shock levels can be predicted by scaling data from existing launch vehicles if the structures; are similar. For new systems, however, ground tests must be performed to provide adequate data. Prediction of environments must be considered as part of the design cycle and not an afterthought. An overview of the approach for the Atlas V family of launch vehicles is given.

TI Design and performance of tip-tilt mirror system for solar telescope
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
ID XUV DOPPLER TELESCOPE; MAGNETIC RECONNECTION; A MISSION; FLARE
AB The tip-tilt mirror (TTM) system was developed for the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) Cassegrain telescope aboard the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science sounding rocket. The spatial resolution of the telescope is about 5 arcsec, whereas the rocket pointing is only controlled to be within +/-0.5 deg of the target (sun) without additional stability control. To stabilize the XUV image within about 5 arcsec on the focal plane, the TTM system controls the tilt of the secondary mirror with two-axis fixed-coil magnetic actuators. The TTM system has a wide tilt angle and can drive the large secondary mirror at high frequency. The two position-sensitive detectors, one placed in the telescope and the other in the TTM mechanical structure, are used for closed-loop control of the TTM. The closed-loop control system, which has command and telemetry, is executed by the flight software on the digital signal processor. The TTM has a launch-lock mechanism to protect against launch vibrations up to about 16G. The sounding rocket was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center on 31 January 1998. The TTM worked perfectly during the flight and achieved better than the expected 5-arcsec stability on the focal plane during CCD charge-coupled device exposures.

AB This paper presents a methodology for applying mu-synthesis to a real high-order system: launch vehicle attitude and vibration control. The design involves robust characteristics against uncertainties of the system parameters as well as precise tracking performance under limited rigidity. As the plant dynamics has an extremely high order and unstable character, the standard mu-synthesis cannot be directly applied. Thus, the standard procedure is modified in a special way in order to make the approach more efficient. The methodology provided in the study will contribute to a better understanding of how to apply the robust control theory to complicated real problems.

AB Current rocket engines, due to their method of construction, the materials used and the extreme loads to which they are subjected, feature a limited number of load cycles.
   Various technology programmes in Europe are concerned, besides developing reliable and rugged, low cost, throwaway equipment, with preparing for future reusable propulsion technologies. One of the key roles for realizing reusable engine components is the use of modem and innovative materials. One of the key technologies which concern various engine manufacturers worldwide is the development of fibre-reinforced ceramics-ceramic matrix composites. The advantages for the developers are obvious-the low specific weight, the high specific strength over a large temperature range, and their great damage tolerance compared to monolithic ceramics make this material class extremely interesting as a construction material.
   Over the past years, the Astrium company (formerly DASA) has, together with various partners, worked intensively on developing components for hypersonic engines and liquid rocket propulsion systems. In the year 2000, various hot-firing tests with subscale (scale 1:5) and full-scale nozzle extensions were conducted. In this year, a further decisive milestone was achieved in the sector of small thrusters, and long-term tests served to demonstrate the extraordinary stability of the C/SiC material.
   Besides developing and testing radiation-cooled nozzle components and small-thruster combustion chambers, Astrium worked on the preliminary development of actively cooled structures for future reusable propulsion systems. In order to get one step nearer to this objective, the development of a new fibre composite was commenced within the framework of a regionally sponsored programme. The objective here is to create multidirectional (3D) textile structures combined with a cost-effective infiltration process. Besides material and process development, the project also encompasses the development of special metal/ceramic and ceramic/ceramic joining techniques as well as studying and verifying non destructive investigation processes for the purpose of testing components. @ 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The report represents results of an experimental research with action of vibrations and force gravitational fields of various intensities. The boundary frequency bands and amplitude, at which heat and mass transfer is improved or becomes worse, are equal to 60 Hz, and amplitudes are equal to approximately 3 or 5 mm. The idealized substantiations of vibration actions on heat and mass transfer of all three zones of heat pipes are given. The new concept of influence of vibrations on processes in heat pipes is offered. The outcomes of research of influence of orientation of heat pipes as model of gravitational fields on operation of vibrations are submitted. The increase of the transmitted thermal capacity is registered at influence of vibrations of low and average frequencies on a heat pipe with a diameter of 6 mm, and also vibrations of higher frequencies on a heat pipe with a diameter of 4 mm. For a pipe of diameter 6 mm the vibration with frequency of about 100 Hz reduces thermal resistance, for other investigated frequencies the influence of vibrations does not have any effect on thermal resistance, or conducts to its growth. With reduction of the size of heat pipe, the characteristic frequency grows. (C) 2003 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of any future reusable launch vehicle (RLV) shall aim at a significant reduction of the payload transportation costs. One of the most expensive systems for any RLV is the thermal protection system (TPS), which protects the vehicle from the high thermal loads during re-entry. EADS ST is developing and qualifying TPS components and technologies for a wide range of applications and temperatures. As a part of the German National technology research programme ASTRA, these technologies were used for a TPS pre-design of the suborbital Hopper (Fig. 1) as a reference RLV system.
   On the basis of aerothermal re-entry loads determined by computational fluid dynamics methods, temperatures and heat loads during re-entry were determined for the entire vehicle. According to those findings, one or more possible TPS concepts were then pre-selected for the various vehicle areas according to the maximum temperatures. After the final selection (using trade-offs when necessary), a conservative estimate for expected TPS mass was established. (C) 2003 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The development of any future reusable launch vehicle (RLV) shall aim at a significant reduction of the payload transportation costs. One of the most expensive systems for any RLV is the thermal protection system (TPS), which protects the vehicle from the high thermal loads during re-entry. EADS ST is developing and qualifying TPS components and technologies for a wide range of applications and temperatures. As a part of the German National technology research programme ASTRA, these technologies were used for a TPS pre-design of the suborbital Hopper (Fig. 1) as a reference RLV system.
   On the basis of aerothermal re-entry loads determined by computational fluid dynamics methods, temperatures and heat loads during re-entry were determined for the entire vehicle. According to those findings, one or more possible TPS concepts were then pre-selected for the various vehicle areas according to the maximum temperatures. After the final selection (using trade-offs when necessary), a conservative estimate for expected TPS mass was established. (C) 2003 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Astronautic and Rocket Society Celje (ARSC) formed a special working team for research and development of a small meteorological hail suppression rocket in the 70th. The bail suppression system was established in former Yugoslavia in the late 60th as an attempt to protect important agricultural regions from one of the summer's most vicious storm. In this time Slovenia was a part of Yugoslavia as one of the federal republic with relative high developed agricultural region production.
   The Rocket program 'RCHX-STORM' was a second attempt, for Slovenia indigenously developed in the production of meteorological hail suppression rocket. ARSC has designed a family of small sounding rocket that were based on highly promising hybrid propellant propulsion. Hybrid propulsion was selected for this family because it was offering low cost, save production and operation and simple logistics.
   Conventional sounding rockets use solid propellant motor for their propulsion. The introduction of hybrid motors has enabled a considerable. decrease in overall cost. The transportation handling and storage procedures were greatly simplified due to the fact that a hybrid motor was not considered as explosive matter. A hybrid motor may also be designed to stand a severe environment without resorting to conditioning arrangements.
   The program started in the late 70th when the team ARSC was integrated in the Research and Development Institute in Celje (RDIC).
   The development program aimed to produce three types of meteorological rockets with diameters 76, 120 and 160 mm.
   Development of the RCHX-76 engine and rocket vehicle including flight certification has been undertaken by a joint team comprising of the ARCS, RDIC and the company Cestno podjetje Celje (CPC), Road building company Celje.
   Many new techniques and methods were used in this program such as computer simulation of external and internal ballistics, composite materials for rocket construction, intensive static testing of models and flight configuration with long flight-testing program.
   The main features of this project were discussed in this paper, summarizing the history of the development of the RCHX-STORM rockets family. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electrified thunderstorm anvil clouds extend the threat of natural and triggered lightning to space launch and landing operations far beyond the immediate vicinity of thunderstorm cells. The deep convective updrafts of thunderstorms transport large amounts of water vapor, supercooled water droplets, and ice crystals into the upper troposphere, forming anvil clouds, which are then carried downstream by the prevailing winds in the anvil-formation layer. Electrified anvil clouds have been observed over the space launch and landing facilities of the John F. Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), emanating from thunderstorm activity more than 200 km away. Space launch commit criteria and flight rules require launch and landing vehicles to avoid penetration of the nontransparent portion of anvil clouds. The life cycles of 163 anvil clouds over the Florida peninsula and its coastal waters were documented using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-8 visible imagery on 49 anvil-case days during the months of May - July 2001. Anvil clouds were found to propagate at the speed and direction of upper-tropospheric winds in the layer from 300 to 150 hPa, approximately 9.4 - 14 km in altitude, with an effective average transport lifetime of approximately 2 h and a standard deviation of approximately 30 min. The effective lifetime refers to the time required for the nontransparent leading edge of an anvil cloud to reach its maximum extent before beginning to dissipate. The information about propagation and lifetime was incorporated into the design, construction, and implementation of an objective short-range anvil forecast tool based on upper-air observations, for use on the Meteorological Interactive Data Display System within the Range Weather Operations facility of the 45th Weather Squadron at CCAFS and the Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center.

TI Rate damping control for small satellite using thruster
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB There are various control laws for attitude stabilization and maneuvering such as magnetic torque control, solar torque control, momentum exchange control. Such controllers work in a linear continuous mode. But the torque that they can produce is in the range of 0.02-1 N m for momentum exchange control, 10(-2)-10(-3) N m for magnetic torque control, and 10(-5)-10(-6) N in for solar torque control. Therefore, the speed of attitude maneuvering is limited by the low-level maximal torques that can be delivered to the attitude control system. Thruster control used in attitude control is no linear continuous reaction thrust control. However, they can provide almost any torque level. Their range between 0.01 N m and 30 N in, which is very common in most satellite. It is practical and convenient to use thruster for the rate damping control of small satellite during initial separation from launch vehicle. The paper deals with the analysis and design of thruster attitude control of a small satellite OptimSat. Simulation results shows that rate damping control for small satellite using thruster is effective. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Experimental and numerical aerodynamic analysis of a satellite launch
   vehicle with strap-on boosters
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Results of numerical simulation of inviscid compressible flow around a generic satellite launch vehicle (SLV) with strap-on boosters using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code named Star-CD are experimentally evaluated. Governing equations of flow around the SLV with two and two strap-on boosters were solved in three dimensions using the SIMPLE algorithm in an unstructured tetrahedral mesh, to determine longitudinal aerodynamic coefficients and surface pressure distribution at Mach numbers from 0-6 to 2-0, and angles-of-attack from 0degrees to 16degrees. To evaluate the numerical results, 1:100th scale models of the SLV were tested in a trisonic wind tunnel in the same configurations and flow conditions as those analysed numerically. Comparison of results shows reasonable agreement between numerical and experimental values, however, drag coefficients had to be corrected to compensate the effects of base flow and the struts connecting the boosters to the core rocket. This evaluation shows that a relatively simple simulation of flow using a commercial CFD code can be considered an efficient tool for prediction of aerodynamic characteristics of a multi body satellite launch vehicle with a level of accuracy acceptable in the process of preliminary aerodynamic design.

AB Understanding the supersonic jet interactions in a plenum chamber is essential for the design of hot launch systems. Static tests were conducted in a small-scale rocket motor loaded with a typical nitramine propellant to produce a nozzle exit Mach number of 3. This supersonic jet is made to interact with plenum chambers having both open and closed sides. The distance between the nozzle exit and the back plate of plenum chamber are varied from 2.5 to 7.0 times the nozzle exit diameter. The pressure rise in the plenum chamber was measured using pressure transducers mounted at different locations.. The pressure-time data were analysed to obtain an. insight into the flow field in the plenum chamber. The maximum pressure exerted on-the back plate of plenum chamber is about 25-35 per cent of the maximum stagnation pressure developed in the rocket motor. Ten static tests were carried out to obtain the effect of axial distance between the nozzle exit and the plenum chamber back plate, and stagnation pressure in the rocket motor on the flow field in the open-sided and closed-sided plenum chambers configurations.

AB Modelling of the supersonic flow within a rocket nozzle of both conventional and expansion deflection (ED) design is well handled by Method of Characteristics based algorithms. This approach provides both a prediction of the flowfield, and allows efficient optimisation of nozzle shape with respect to length. However, the Method of Characteristics requires a solution of the transonic flow through the nozzle throat to provide initial conditions, and the accuracy of the description of the transonic flow will clearly affect the overall accuracy of the complete nozzle flow calculation. However, it is relatively simple to show that conventional analytical methods for this process break down when applied to the more complex throat geometry of ED nozzles. This requires the use of a time marching solution method, which allows the analysis of the flow within this region even on such advanced configurations. This paper demonstrates this capability, outlines a general method for ED nozzle throat geometric definition, and examines the effect of various throat parameters on the permissible range of ED contours. It is found that the design of length optimised ED nozzles is highly sensitive to small changes in these parameters, and hence they must be selected with care.

AB In 1970 the Russian Luna 16 returned just 100 gm of lunar regolith from the Sea of Fertility using a robot spacecraft. Return of 200 gm of surface and sub-surface fines from Mars to Earth for detailed examination would make a major contribution to understanding the geology of that planet. Surface sample return missions have been seen as complex and expensive, demanding a heavy launch vehicle. However, the use of microspacecraft technology and a severely focussed mission objective could minimize the size and cost of such a mission. This paper describes an initial feasibility assessment of a minimum Mars Sample Return mission using a Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle and a Mars orbit rendezvous strategy. The vehicle design could also be adapted to perform an earlier Lunar Sample Return (e.g. from the polar Aitken Basin), allowing new operational technologies to be demonstrated and providing additional scientific return.

AB The MST radar facility located at the low latitude Indian station Gadanki (13.5degreesN, 79.2degreesE) has been used to study the high-resolution spatial structure of the mesospheric return echo power and relate these to the dynamics and electron density irregularities of the region. Special observations carried out using narrow pulse lengths indicate presence of scattering layers down to similar to600 m embedded in the broad turbulence field of about 4-5 km thickness around 75 km height region of the mesosphere. Possible cause of generation of such thin layer structure is examined. The percentage amplitudes of the 3 m electron density irregularity profile are reconstructed for 200 m height resolution from the past rocket borne results over SHAR (13.7degreesN. 80.2degreesE) close to the radar site. At least two rocket results showed that apart from considerable increase in percentage amplitudes of the 3 m size irregularities in the mesospheric height region of 70-80 km, there is evidence of presence of thinner layers of these irregularities similar to that observed in the radar backscatter intensity. Implications of these results are analysed and directions for further research suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Analytical development of a slotted-grain solid rocket motor
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB In most practical solid-rocket-motor design processes, final designs for grains are determined using computer-generated grids. This process is imminently practical for cases in which small numbers of final geometries are to be considered. However, for a grain design optimization process in which large numbers of grain configurations are to be considered, generating grids for each candidate design is often prohibitive. For such optimization processes analytical developments of burn perimeter and port area for two-dimensional grains are critically important. This paper offers a detailed development of the burn-back equations for a slotted grain with burning only on the slot faces. The result is a set of algebraic equations that can be used to predict burn perimeter and port area at a given burn distance for a given slotted grain design.

TI Computational-fluid-dynamics-based design optimization for
   single-element rocket injector
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID PREDICTION
AB A computational-fluid-dynamics-based design optimization approach, utilizing the response surface method, has been proposed for a single-element rocket injector. The overall goal of the effort is to demonstrate the integration of a set of computational and optimization tools to enable the injector designer to objectively determine the trades between performance and life during the design cycle. Using design of experiment techniques, 54 cases are selected, and computational solutions based on the Navier-Stokes equations, finite rate chemistry, and the k-epsilon turbulence closure are obtained. The response surface methodology is employed as the optimization tool. Four independent design variables are selected, namely, H-2 flow angle, H-2 and O-2 flow areas with fixed flow rates, and O-2 posttip thickness. Design optimization is guided by four design objectives. The maximum temperature on the injector element oxidizer posttip, the maximum temperature on the injector face, and a combustion chamber wall temperature are chosen as life indicators. The length of the combustion zone is selected as an indicator of mixing and performance. In the context of this effort, the design optimization tools performed efficiently and reliably. In addition to establishing optimum designs by varying emphasis on the individual objectives, better insight into the interplay between design variables and their impact on the design objectives is gained. The need to include environmental design objectives early in the design phase is clearly established.

ID VELOCITY EXPERIMENT; IONIZATION; FIELD; SPACE
AB We report on data from particle instruments making in situ sounding rocket measurements of the particle environment within and near an aluminum plasma jet caused by an explosion in the auroral ionosphere. The Active Plasma Experiment sounding rocket was launched to an altitude of 350 km from the Poker Flat Research Range in January 1999. The payload separated after launch into observing payloads and two explosive plasma jet generators. During the flight, the two explosive packages were detonated, and the observing payloads studied the surrounding environment. The particle instruments measured the resulting plasma jet from a distance of approximately 500 m. The instruments measured ions from 10 to 420 eV, electrons from 10 to 6000 eV, and low-energy electrons from 2 to 1200 eV After each explosion, the particle instruments recorded the passage of a burst of material past the spacecraft. Analysis of mass-dependent effects, plasma p, and critical ionization velocity parameters are presented, together with a comparison to earlier experimental observations. In particular we note that the duration of the enhanced ion fluxes is controlled by the jet velocity and drops sharply when the jet velocity falls below the critical ionization velocity for each ion, with the peak ion fluxes only observed while v(jet) > V-crit(O+).

AB The development and verification of a dedicated global positioning system (GPS) sensor for sounding rocket missions is described. It is based on the hardware design of a terrestrial low-cost, single-frequency coarse/acquisition (C/A) code receiver but operates an enhanced software that has been specifically adapted for high dynamics applications. Besides the navigation and timing function provided by traditional GPS receivers, the prediction of the instantaneous impact point (IIP) has for the first time been integrated into the receiver software. Making use of a newly developed perturbed-parabolic trajectory model, the receiver can directly perform real-time IIP predictions with an accuracy that is compatible with operational ground software and is only limited by atmospheric forces. It is expected that the availability of onboard IIP prediction will both simplify existing range safety systems and contribute to a future increase of the onboard autonomy of sounding rocket missions. The overall receiver performance is demonstrated with hardware-in-the-loop simulations and actual flight data for representative mission profiles.

AB The results of research into the optical phenomena produced by rocket exhaust products in the upper atmosphere are presented. The data were obtained during routine observations of auroras by all-sky cameras from 1975 to 1990 from the Kola peninsula and Arckchangelsk region. The observed rocket launches were carried out from the Plesetsk and White Sea launch sites during both nighttime and twilight periods. The observed phenomena can be divided into two main types: local phenomena with long development times and relatively short-lived large-scale ones. The characteristic properties of both types are determined, in the first instance, by the type of rocket engines used (solid or liquid propellant) and their operating mode. The most intense, large-scale and dynamic phenomena are caused by separation of rocket stages and shutoff of solid-fuel rocket engines.

TI Simultaneous lidar observations of temperatures and waves in the polar
   middle atmosphere on the east and west side of the Scandinavian
   mountains: a case study on 19/20 January 2003

AB Atmospheric gravity waves have been the subject of intense research for several decades because of their extensive effects on the atmospheric circulation and the temperature structure. The U. Bonn lidar at the Esrange and the ALOMAR RMR lidar at the Andoya Rocket Range are located in northern Scandinavia 250 km apart on the east and west side of the Scandinavian mountain ridge. During January and February 2003 both lidar systems conducted measurements and retrieved atmospheric temperatures. On 19/20 January 2003 simultaneous measurements for more than 7 h were possible. Although during most of the campaign time the atmosphere was not transparent for the propagation of orographically induced gravity waves, they were nevertheless observed at both lidar stations with considerable amplitudes during these simultaneous measurements. And while the source of the observed waves cannot be determined unambiguously, the observations show many characteristics of orographically excited gravity waves. The wave patterns at ALOMAR show a random distribution with time whereas at the Esrange a persistency in the wave patterns is observable. This persistency can also be found in the distribution of the most powerful vertical wavelengths. The mode values are both at about 5 km vertical wavelength, however the distributions are quite different, narrow at the Esrange with values from lambda(z)= 2-6 km and broad at ALOMAR, covering lambda(z)= 1-12 km vertical wavelength. In particular the difference between the observations at ALOMAR and at the Esrange can be understood by different orographic conditions while the propagation conditions were quite similar. At both stations the waves deposit energy in the atmosphere with increasing altitude, which leads to a decrease of the observed gravity wave potential energy density with altitude. The meteorological situation during these measurements was different from common winter situations. The ground winds were mostly northerlies, changed in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere to westerlies and returned to northerlies in the middle stratosphere.

AB The optical spectrograph and infrared imager system (OSIRIS) on board the Odin spacecraft is designed to retrieve altitude profiles of terrestrial atmospheric minor species by observing limb-radiance profiles. The grating optical spectrograph (OS) obtains spectra of scattered sunlight over the range 280-800 nm with a spectral resolution of approximately 1 nm. The Odin spacecraft performs a repetitive vertical limb scan to sweep the OS 1 km vertical field of view over selected altitude ranges from approximately 10 to 100 km. The terrestrial absorption features that are superimposed on the scattered solar spectrum are monitored to derive the minor species altitude profiles. The spectrograph also detects the airglow, which can be used to study the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The other part of OSIRIS is a three-channel infrared imager (IRI) that uses linear array detectors to image the vertical limb radiance over an altitude range of approximately 100 km. The IRI observes both scattered sunlight and the airglow emissions from the oxygen infrared atmospheric band at 1.27 mum and the OH (3-1) Meinel band at 1.53 mum. A tomographic inversion technique is used with a series of these vertical images to derive the two-dimensional distribution of the emissions within the orbit plane.

DT Article
AB RADARSAT-2, designed to be operational for 7 years, will provide continuity for the RADARSAT program. The RADARSAT-2 satellite design includes significant enhancements over its predecessors. The satellite features advanced radar imaging capabilities and will provide image data of the earth in a variety of spatial resolutions, polarizations, and incidence angles. This paper is intended to provide a top-level overview of the RADARSAT-2 space segment designed by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) in response to the requirements specified by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). It provides the overview of each component of the space segment, such as the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) payload, the spacecraft bus, the extendible support structure (ESS), and the launch vehicle (LV). It also describes the major activities during spacecraft assembly, integration and testing (AI&T). The enhanced capabilities of RADARSAT-2 in comparison with those of RADARSAT-1 are highlighted throughout this paper.

AB SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics) is a future mission to launch a large infrared observatory to the second Sun-Earth Lagrangian liberation point (L2) by H-IIA rocket. A unique feature of its cryogenic system is a warm launch system using radiative cooling and closed-cycle mechanical coolers in orbit to cool its detectors and mirrors down to about 4.5 and 1.7 K. The 1 K-class cooler, which consists of a two-stage Stirling cooler and a Joule-Thomson (JT) cooler with He-3 as the working fluid, has been developed for cooling the far infrared detectors to 1.7 K. Designed cooling capacity of the cooler is 10 mW at 1.7 K and the total input power to the cooler is about 180 W without driver electronics.
   This paper describes the preliminary design and the results from preliminary test of the prototype cooler for the 1 K-class cooler. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Review
AB Biotechnology inventions raise both moral and technical dilemmas. The patent system was developed to protect inventions such as the Spinning Jenny and Stevenson's Rocket. This article looks at how this long-established and slow-moving system is coping with a modern, highly sophisticated and swiftly moving field of science. It looks at specific areas of the technology - research tools and claims that reach to the products produced using those tools, genes, stem cells and bioinformatics. It concludes that the system is having to adapt, but that it will cope.

An approach to determine the stability limits and acoustic characteristics of injectors is described intensively. Procedures for extrapolation of the model operating parameters to the actual conditions are presented, which allow the hot-fire test data to be presented by parameters of the combustion chamber pressure and mixture (oxidizer/fuel) ratio, which are customary for designers. Tests with the model chamber, based on the suggested scaling method, are far more cost-effective than with the actual (full-scale) chamber and useful for injector screening at the initial stage of the combustor development in a viewpoint of combustion instabilities.

AB The Ultraviolet and Visible-Light Coronagraphic Imager is the baseline coronagraph for the European Space Agency's payload Solar Orbiter, a solar mission whose launch in 2011 is expected. To prove the feasibility of its innovative design, a sounding rocket version of the same instrument has been approved by NASA. One of the main technological challenges of the instrument is the achievement of multilayer optical coatings with suitable proper-ties. We describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of such coatings. (C) 2004 Optical Society of America.

DE hypersonic launcher; space launcher; gas rocket
AB The present contribution describes a hypersonic gas rocket that uses tube walls as a container for moving compressed air. Burn programmes (fuel injections) are suggested that enable the internal tube components to be used as a rocket. A long tube (up to 0.4-0.8 km) is located in the sea and provides mobility and serves as an aiming device. Relatively inexpensive oxidizer and fuel are used (compressed air or gaseous oxygen and kerosene). When a projectile crosses the Earth's atmosphere with an angle of more then 15(0), then the loss of speed and the weight of the required thermal protection system are small. The research shows that the launcher can give a projectile a speed of up to 5-8 km/sec. The proposed launcher can deliver up to 85,000 tons of payload to space annually at a cost of one to two dollars per pound of payload. The launcher can also deliver about 500 tons of mail or express parcels per day over continental distances, and can be used as an energy station and accumulator. During war, this launch system could deliver military munitions to targets thousands to tens of thousands of kilometers away from the launch site.

DE spaceplane design; SKYLON; CFRP space frame; fuselage structure
AB A reusable SSTO spaceplane employing dual mode airbreathing/rocket engines, such as SKYLON, has a voluminous fuselage in order to accommodate the considerable quantities of hydrogen fuel needed for the ascent. The loading intensity which this fuselage has to withstand is relatively low due to the modest in-flight inertial accelerations coupled with the very low density of liquid hydrogen. Also the requirement to accommodate considerable temperature differentials between the internal cryogenic tankage and the aerodynamically heated outer skin of the vehicle imposes an additional design constraint that results in an optimum fuselage structural concept very different to conventional aircraft or rocket practice. Several different structural concepts exist for the primary loadbearing structure. This paper explores the design possibilities of the various types and explains why an independent near ambient temperature CFRP truss structure was selected for the SKYLON vehicle. The construction of such a truss structure, at a scale not witnessed since the days of the airship, poses a number of manufacturing and design difficulties. In particular the construction of the nodes and their attachment to the struts is considered to be a key issue. This paper describes the current design status of the overall truss geometry, strut construction and manufacturing route, and the final method of assembly. The results of a preliminary strut and node test programme are presented which give confidence that the design targets will eventually be met.

TI Full- and partial-admission performance of the simplex turbine
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID SUPERSONIC TURBINE; UNSTEADY-FLOW
AB The turbines used in rocket-engine applications are often partial-admission turbines, meaning that the flow enters the rotor over only a portion of the annulus. These turbines have been traditionally analyzed, however, assuming full-admission characteristics. This assumption enables the simulation of only a portion of the 360-deg annulus with periodic boundary conditions applied in the circumferential direction. Whereas this traditional approach to simulating the flow in partial-admission turbines significantly reduces the computational requirements, the accuracy of the solutions has not been evaluated or compared to partial-admission data. In the current investigation, both full-admission and partial-admission three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations were performed. for a partial-admission turbine designed and tested at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The results indicate that the partial-admission nature of the turbine should be included in simulations to properly predict the performance and flow unsteadiness of the turbine.

AB The second-generation reusable launch vehicle will incorporate sophisticated new guidance and control methods to increase the system's flexibility, in particular making it a practical vehicle for unmanned cargo missions. This project focuses on trajectory design and guidance for the terminal area energy management phase of flight, where traditional methods have produced limited results. Fuzzy logic methods are used to make onboard autonomous gliding return trajectory design robust to the possibility of control surface failures, thus, increasing the flexibility of unmanned gliding recovery and landing. Fuzzy inference systems are used to design the trajectory and provide guidance commands for the vehicle bank angle and negative z axis acceleration. Fuzzy logic provides a practical means of incorporating conflicting objectives and constraints in choosing trajectory parameters. The method has the flexibility to choose these parameters from a continuum of possible values. The design is validated using a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom simulation of the X-33 technology demonstrator.

AB This paper presents a study of a fully reusable earth-to-orbit launch vehicle concept with horizontal take-off and landing, employing a turbojet engine for low speed, and a rocket for high-speed acceleration and space operations. This concept uses existing technology to the maximum possible extent, thereby reducing development time, cost and effort. It uses the experience in aerial filling of military aircrafts for propellant filling at an altitude of 13 km at a flight speed of M = 0.85. Aerial filling of propellant reduces the take-off weight significantly thereby minimizing the structural weight of the vehicles The vehicle takes off horizontally and uses turbojet engines till the end of the propellant filling operation. The rocket engines provide thrust for the next phase till the injection of a satellite at LEO. A sensitivity analysis of the mission with respect to rocket engine specific impulse and overall vehicle structural factor is also presented in this paper. A conceptual design of space plane with a payload capability of 10 ton to LEO is carried out. The study shows that the realization of an aerial propellant transfer space plane is possible with limited development of new technology thus reducing the demands on the finances required for achieving the objectives.

AB We report the observation of an intense gamma-ray burst observed on the ground at sea level, produced in association with the initial-stage of rocket-triggered lightning at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding, FL. The burst was observed simultaneously on three NaI(Tl)/photomultiplier tube detectors that were located 650 m from the triggered lightning channel with gamma-ray energies extending up to more than 10 MeV. The burst consisted of 227 individual gamma-rays that arrived over a 300 ms time period in coincidence with an 11 kA current pulse. The burst of gamma-rays had very different characteristics from the x-ray emission frequently seen in association with the dart leader/return stroke sequences of triggered lightning and may represent a new kind of event, likely originating from cloud processes thousands of meters overhead.

DE Eruca sativa L.; seedlings production; seedlings densitiy; cell size
AB The experiment was realized in Ponta Grossa (PR) aiming at avaluating seedlings density/cells using different trays and its effects on seedlings production and yield of rocket press. The experimental design was a randomised blocks with four replications; the treatments followed a factorial arrangement 4 x 2, being 1, 2, 3 and 4 seedlings/cell on trays with 200 and 288 cells. Seeds were sowed on 28/03/2003, with the cultivar Cultivada on trays with commercial substrate Plantmax under protected cultivation. Before seedlings transplanting it was avaluated the characteristics of leaves number, lenght of upper part and root, fresh and dry weight of up ground material and root. The seedlings transplanting was carried out through with seventeen days in plots containing 40 plants in 0,20 x 0,10 m arrangement. At harvesting, 20 days of the seedlings transplanting, it was avaluated the following characteristics: lenght of upper part, leaves number, fresh and dry weight of up ground material. On the seedlings stage it was observed a significative effect of the interaction. The cell size was an important factor on seedlings production and it depended also on seedlings densities/cell. The best seedlings quality was obtained using trays with 200 cells, compared to 288 cells. Increasing the seedlings density/cell it was observed higher effect of seedlings competition, mainly on trays of 288 cells on the characteristics of leaves number, fresh weight of up ground material and lenght of upper part and root. However these differences were diluted during plants development on the field, being at the harvesting only the characteristic of leaves number still superior on trays of 200 cells (volume of 16 cm(3)) compared to 288 cells (12 cm(3)). On the other hand the seedlings density/cell promoted yield response on rocket press. It was observed linear response on yield. It was observed decreasing on lenght of upper part, leaves number, fresh and dry weight of up ground material, in response of competition pressure among plants promoted by density increasing. However it was observed linear increment on yield/area with the increasing of the seedlings/density. The increment on fresh weight was significative considering yield average of 1,4 kg m(-2) on density of single seedling and 6,4 kg m(-2) when it was used four seedlings/cell. It was observed that when density was increased, higher was the yield on fresh weight to both trays. Considering the commercialization of rocket press mainly on bunch, it seems more interesting a higher density with four seedlings, on trays with 200 or 288 cells.

AB An updated assessment of uncertainties in "observed" climatological winds and temperatures in the middle atmosphere (over altitudes similar to10-80 km) is provided by detailed intercomparisons of contemporary and historic datasets. These datasets include global meteorological analyses and assimilations, climatologies derived from research satellite measurements, historical reference atmosphere circulation statistics, rocketsonde wind and temperature data, and lidar temperature measurements. The comparisons focus on a few basic circulation statistics (temperatures and zonal winds), with special attention given to tropical variability. Notable differences are found between analyses for temperatures near the tropical tropopause and polar lower stratosphere, temperatures near the global stratopause, and zonal winds throughout the Tropics. Comparisons of historical reference atmosphere and rocketsonde temperatures with more recent global analyses show the influence of decadal-scale cooling of the stratosphere and mesosphere. Detailed comparisons of the tropical semiannual oscillation (SAO) and quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) show large differences in amplitude between analyses; recent data assimilation schemes show the best agreement with equatorial radiosonde, rocket, and satellite data.

TI Metallic thermal protection system requirements, environments, and

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Achieving the ultimate goal of an economically viable reusable launch vehicle will eventually require developing Federal Aviation Regulation-type performance-based requirements and certification by the Federal Aviation Administration, as is currently done for commercial transports. Because the necessary requirements do not currently exist, there is no verifiable and traceable link between thermal protection system design implementation and resulting performance, safety, and cost. An initial attempt has been made to outline a set of performance-based thermal protection system design requirements. Critical requirements that will have a profound effect on the economic viability of a reusable launch vehicle, such as those for ground hail strike, lightning strike, bird strike, rain/rain erosion, and on-orbit debris/micrometeoroid hypervelocity impact have been proposed. In addition to design requirements, the importance of both compiling a comprehensive loads envelope and deriving time- and location-consistent loads for thermal protection system design and sizing is addressed. Including ascent abort trajectories as limit-load cases and on-orbit debris/micrometeoroid hypervelocity impact as one of the discrete-source-damage cases is imperative because of their significant impact on thermal protection system design and resulting performance, reliability, and operability. General features of a suite of integrated airframe concepts is summarized, and the specific details of a metallic thermal protection system concept having design flexibility that enables weight and operability to be traded and balanced is described.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB A process is developed to perform thermal and structural analysis and sizing and to perform sensitivity studies on the latest metallic thermal protection system developed at NASA Langley Research Center. The process defined can be used to determine appropriate materials and approximate thicknesses and is the basis for initial thermal protection system weight estimates. Metallic thermal protection systems are a key technology for reducing the cost of reusable launch vehicles, offering the combination of increased durability and competitive weights when compared to other systems. Accurate sizing of metallic thermal protection systems requires combined thermal and structural analysis. Initial sensitivity studies were conducted using transient one-dimensional finite element thermal analysis to determine the influence of various design and analysis parameters on thermal protection system weight. The thermal analysis model was then used in combination with static deflection and failure mode analysis of the thermal protection system sandwich panel outer surface to obtain minimum weight configurations at three vehicle stations on the windward centerline of a representative reusable launch vehicle. The coupled nature of the analysis requires an iterative analysis process, which is described. Findings from the sensitivity analysis are reported, along with preliminary designs at the three vehicle stations considered.

AB A process is developed to perform thermal and structural analysis and sizing and to perform sensitivity studies on the latest metallic thermal protection system developed at NASA Langley Research Center. The process defined can be used to determine appropriate materials and approximate thicknesses and is the basis for initial thermal protection system weight estimates. Metallic thermal protection systems are a key technology for reducing the cost of reusable launch vehicles, offering the combination of increased durability and competitive weights when compared to other systems. Accurate sizing of metallic thermal protection systems requires combined thermal and structural analysis. Initial sensitivity studies were conducted using transient one-dimensional finite element thermal analysis to determine the influence of various design and analysis parameters on thermal protection system weight. The thermal analysis model was then used in combination with static deflection and failure mode analysis of the thermal protection system sandwich panel outer surface to obtain minimum weight configurations at three vehicle stations on the windward centerline of a representative reusable launch vehicle. The coupled nature of the analysis requires an iterative analysis process, which is described. Findings from the sensitivity analysis are reported, along with preliminary designs at the three vehicle stations considered.

AB A new metallic thermal-protection-system concept has been designed, analyzed, and fabricated. A specific location on a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle was selected to develop loads and requirements needed to design prototype panels. The design loads include ascent and entry heating rates, pressures, acoustics, and accelerations. Additional design issues were identified and discussed. An iterative sizing procedure was used to size the thermal protection system panels for thermal and structural loads as part of an integrated wall construction that included the thermal protection system and cryogenic tank structure. The panels were sized to maintain acceptable temperatures on the underlying structure and to operate under the design structural loading. Detailed creep. analyses were also performed on critical components of the panels. Four 18-in.-square metallic thermal-protection-system panels were fabricated. A lightweight, thermally compliant support system to connect the thermal protection system to the cryogenic tank structure was designed and fabricated.

AB The ballistite material is one kind of special composite material. Its mechanical behaviors highly affect the reliability and stability of the rocket operation. Because of its special properties of large deformations under loading and high particle composite in structures, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the ballistite deformations using the conventional speckle methods or the contact methods. Two methods, the Scanning Phase Method (SPM) and Time Sequence Phase Method (TSPM) in Temporal Speckle Pattern Interferometry (TSPI), have been applied to investigate the special mechanical behaviors of the ballistite material under mechanical, thermal, and mechanical-thermal loads, and the creep behaviors of the ballistite material under the loads are analyzed in this paper.

AB KSR-III, the third Korean Sounding Rocket, was launched successfully at Anheung, Korea on Nov. 28, 2002. One of the scientific missions of KSR-III was to measure the stratospheric ozone density profile by using an onboard four-channel UV radiometer. The apogee of the rocket was 42.8 km, and the total flight time was 231 s. The UV radiometer onboard the KSR-III measured the attenuation of solar radiation during ascending phase to obtain a vertical profile of the ozone density. The detector has UV channels centered at 255, 290, and 310 nm and a visible channel at 450 nm for attitude reference. Because the measurement of the solar radiation depends on the response function of the sensor, calibrations of interference filters and phototubes must be done. The optical calibration system consists of a monochromator, an optical power meter, light detectors, standard light sources, a control PC, and data acquisition software. The application of the rocket-borne UV radiometer onboard the KSR-III to the Ozone measurement are presented together with the calibration results from the integrated calibration system at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute. Using the calibration results and the in-situ measurement data, we obtained the ozone number density profile, and compared with other measurements.

AB Recent R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation rates in N-like Si VIII are used to derive theoretical emission line intensity ratios involving 2s(2)2p(3)-2s2p(4) transitions in the 216 -320 Angstrom wavelength range. A comparison of these with an extensive dataset of solar active region, quiet-Sun, sub-flare and off-limb observations, obtained during rocket flights of the Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS), indicates that the ratio R-1 = I(216.94 Angstrom)/I(319.84 Angstrom) may provide a usable electron density diagnostic for coronal plasmas. The ratio involves two lines of comparable intensity, and varies by a factor of about 5 over the useful density range of 10(8)-10(11) cm(-3). However R-2 = I(276.85 Angstrom)/I(319.84 Angstrom) and R-3 = I(277.05 Angstrom)/I(319.84 Angstrom) show very poor agreement between theory and observation, due to the severe blending of the 276.85 and 277.05 Angstrom lines with Si VII and Mg VII transitions, respectively, making the ratios unsuitable as density diagnostics. The 314.35 Angstrom feature of Si VIII also appears to be blended, with the other species contributing around 20% to the total line flux.

AB [1] Laboratory experiments involving the interaction of lower hybrid waves and density cavities with full width at half maximums ranging from 1 congruent to k(perpendicular to)delta less than or equal to 4, where delta = c/omega(pe) is the collisionless skin depth, were performed several years ago at the University of California, Los Angeles. The results were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research in December 2001 [Rosenberg and Gekelman, 2001]. These experiments are relevant to scaled parameters in the auroral ionosphere. This is a comment to the paper of Schuck et al. [ 2003], regarding the laboratory experiment on lower hybrid (LH) waves in the presence of a density striation. The main point Schuck et al. [ 2003] wish to make is that density striations in the auroral ionosphere are narrower than delta and that kappa(perpendicular to)delta approximate to 10 there. They argue that if this condition is not strictly satisfied in laboratory experiment then they are inappropriate to model the physics occurring in the ionosphere. In our experiments an incoming short perpendicular wavelength lower hybrid wave impinges upon a density striation which is many parallel ( to B-0) LH wavelengths long. A striking transformation occurs in which a cavity mode confined to the density gradient of the striation is excited. The mode localization does not depend on the ratio of the cavity diameter with respect to delta. We discuss the properties of lower hybrid waves, the experimental results as well as differences in the rocket and laboratory experiments.

AB The Turbulent Oxygen Mixing Experiment (TOMEX) was designed to measure the atmospheric response to the existence of unstable layers as determined by wind and temperature measurements from 80 to 105 km. TOMEX combined Na lidar measurements, from Starfire Optical Range in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with a launch of a payload from White Sands Missile Range, located between 100 and 150 km south of Starfire. The payload included a trimethyl aluminum chemical release to measure winds and diffusion, a 5-channel ionization gauge to measure neutral density fluctuations at high vertical resolution, and a 3-channel photometer experiment to measure atomic oxygen related airglow. The rocket was launched when the lidar data indicated the presence of convectively and dynamically unstable regions between 80 and 100 km altitude. For several hours prior to the launch, there had existed a large amplitude atmospheric gravity wave or tide which brought the background atmosphere into being nearly convectively unstable over the 85 to 95 km region. In addition a large overturning in Na density, possibly due to a convective roll, existed at altitudes around 100 km. This type of instability had not been previously seen and identified in this altitude region. The TOMEX payload measured the existence of Kelvin-Helmholz billows, enhanced neutral density fluctuations, enhanced energy dissipation, and well-mixed regions. These features were associated with convectively unstable regions, dynamically unstable regions, convective rolls, and the presence of this large wave. The unstable regions were persistent and covered large vertical (and horizontal regions) of the atmosphere. The atmospheric mixing and energy dissipation appeared to be largely determined by the presence and nature of these instabilities.

AB R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation rates in N-like S x are used to derive theoretical emission-line intensity ratios involving 2s(2)2p(3)-2s2p(4) transitions in the 189-265 Angstrom wavelength range. A comparison of these with observational data for solar flares and active regions, obtained with the Naval Research Laboratory's S082A spectrograph on board Skylab and the Solar EUV Rocket Telescope and Spectrograph, reveals that many of the S x lines in the spectra are badly blended with emission features from other species. However, the intensity ratios I(228.70 Angstrom)/I(264.24 Angstrom) and I(228.70 Angstrom)/I(259.49 Angstrom) are found to provide useful electron density diagnostics for flares, although the latter cannot be employed for active regions, because of blending of the 259.49 Angstrom line with an unidentified transition in these solar features.

AB Ultraviolet dayglow observed using the Ionospheric Spectroscopy and Atmospheric Chemistry (ISAAC) satellite instrument is used to determine the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere. ISAAC was launched in February 1999 on board the Advanced Research and Global Observing Satellite (ARGOS). We focus on ISAAC dayside limb observations at tangent altitudes between 80 and 200 km and over the latitude range 40degreesN-70degreesS. The data analyzed here were obtained in November and December 1999 during a period of moderate to high solar activity. The NO density retrievals include constraints on instrument sensitivity, in-flight assessments of stray light, and determinations of Rayleigh-scattered background contributions. Residual spectra contain strong dayglow signatures of the NO g bands which are used for inversion of measured radiances to absolute NO concentrations. Comparison between ISAAC measurements and photochemical calculations indicates improved agreement above 130 km using O-2 and temperatures from the new NRLMSISE-00, as compared to the MS model. In the lower thermosphere, observed daily variations in low-latitude nitric oxide are strongly correlated with variations in the solar soft X-ray flux.

AB The impulse between the launch vehicle and the atmosphere can generate a lot of noise and vibration during the process of launching a satellite. In this situation, random vibrations can cause the malfunction of the electronic equipment of the device. In general, the safety of the electronic equipment is related to the natural frequency, shapes of mode and the dynamic deflection of the PCB in the electronic equipment. Structural vibration analysis of PCBs and their electronic components can be performed using either FEM or a vibration test. In this study, the natural frequency and dynamic deflection of a PCB were measured by ITEM, and the safety of the electronic components of the PCB were evaluated according to the results. This study presents a unique method for the finite element modeling and analysis of PCBs and their electronic components. The results of the FEA were verified using a vibration test. The method proposed herein may be applicable to various designs ranging from satellite's electronic equipment to home electronics.

AB Based on high level safety and cost requirements, system architects and subsystem engineers are called upon to provide requirements at a lower level during the conceptual design phase of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). This paper describes an event tree based methodology for quantitatively assessing the limits of some of the lower-level Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) requirements during RLV conceptual design. The metrics assessed in the paper are fault detection coverage, false alarm probability, fault isolation capability, probability of IVHM failing to detect a fault, and safety allocation. The fault detection and isolation metrics were assessed based on their applicability with respect to cost and safety in the mission and turnaround phase of the RLV operations. The paper shows that the mission-phase requirement for IVHM fault detection coverage for a subsystem is large (more stringent) when IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, the failure remediation probability is small, and the subsystem is already reliable. The requirement on IVHM false alarm rate in the mission phase is small (more stringent) when the subsystem is reliable, IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, and IVHM should cause fewer false aborts.
   The paper concludes by stressing the use of appropriate system analysis and optimization in allocating IVHM requirements to a subsystem of the RLV. Although the paper is written from an IVHM and RLV perspective, it is targeted towards system engineers/architects who are interested in estimating the effects of fault detection and isolation requirements during conceptual design.

AB The NASA Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program is evaluating various concepts for less expensive and reduced-risk access to space. Critical to these goals are more reliable and easily maintained vehicles, with high fidelity Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) systems, rapid turn-around time and dual-use technology. The initial application of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) on the Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) Architecture 6 Concept has helped to define key assumptions necessary to make the development of the Architecture 6 concept successful. While the final figures of merit (FOMs) will be based on successfully developing and testing the vehicle, preliminary FOMs can be used now for basic trades between propulsion and staging concepts, thus providing a valuable tool to evaluate the overall trade space between highly divergent concepts. Reliability analysis, Probabilistic Design Methods (PDM), and Probabilistic Risk Assessment can be integrated to evaluate overall systems architecture, a complete mission model, and a fleet logistics model. In addition, the PRA may be used to evaluate and compare a high and low energy crew escape system.

DE solar photon thruster; terrestrial pole sitter
AB Geosynchronous satellites are invisible at high latitudes. A pole-sitting spacecraft would have communication, climate-studies, and near-polar Earth observation applications. We present a pole-sitter based on the solar photon thruster (SPT), a two-sail variant of the solar sail using a large curved collector sail (always normal to the Sun) to direct sunlight against a much smaller thruster. Thrust decreases slower for an SPT than for a conventional sail arrangement as the angle between sunlight and the collector normal increases. An SPT pole-sitter is offset from. the terrestrial pole so that a component of Earth gravity balances the solar radiation-pressure component pushing the SPT off station. The component of gravitational attraction of the Earth pulling the spacecraft towards Earth is also balanced by a solar radiation-pressure component. Results are presented for 80-100% collector/thruster reflectivities. For a spacecraft area] mass thickness of 0.002 kg/m(2), collector and thruster reflectivities of 0.9, the SPT can be situated above latitude 45degrees at a distance of approximately 60 Earth radii. An SPT pole sitter would be affected by lunar perturbation, which can be compensated for by an on-board rocket thruster producing 2 X 10(-6) g acceleration, a second SPT thruster sail thrusting against the influence of the Moon, or by directing a microwave beam against the spacecraft. Since an SPT pole sitter is in a position rather than an orbit, the effect of terrestrial gravitation limits the size and design of the payload package, which limits terrestrial target resolution.

ID STOCHASTIC MICROFRACTURE PROCESS; COMPOSITES; FRACTURE
AB It was pointed out that one of the causes of recent failure to launch rocket was due to the fracture of nozzle throat insert made of graphite materials. The relationship between mechanical properties and microfracture process in graphite was not enough analyzed. To ensure the reliability of such aerospace equipment, we considered the necessity of assurance by non-destructive evaluation, evaluation of mechanical property for graphite material and design based on fracture probability. In this study.. four-point bending test and fracture toughness test were used to evaluate mechanical properties. Mean strength, Weibull parameters, and R-curve for crack propagation were estimated. AE measurement during tests was performed in order to obtain location and stress of microfracture. AE results were analyzed by stochastic process theory. The result of AE demonstrates that microfracture process during bending test is divided into three stages. AE behavior in fracture toughness test was also closely related to crack propagation.

ID VELOCITY
AB In Cold Spray method, a coating is formed by exposing a substrate to high velocity solid-phase particles, which have been accelerated by supersonic gas flow at a temperature much lower than the melting or softening temperature of the feedstock. Therefore, the nozzle geometry is important with regard to the cold spray method. This Cold Spray process is an exciting new spray technology that has the potential to overcome limitations of more traditional thermal spray processes for some important commercial applications. With this emerging technology, it is possible for the first time to rapidly deposit thin or very thick layers (mm to cm+) of a wide range of metals, and even some composite materials, without melting or vaporization, at or near room temperature, in an ambient air environment.
   Some potential areas of interest include: corrosion protection, wear reduction, highly conductive coatings (electrical or thermal), metal/glass or metal/ceramic joints (with less residual stress), ceramic/metal or graded metal/metal composites, thick deposits (mm to several cm range), reclamation of worn or mis-machined parts, metallization of glass or ceramics.
   The applications of Cold Spray can be examined in the field of an automobile and a rocket engine.

AB Fibre reinforced composite material is widely used in multi-industrial fields where weight reduction of the infrastructure is required because of its high specific modulus and specific strength. Using this material has two main merits. One is to cut down energy use by reducing weight and the other is to prevent explosive damage preceding the sudden burst generated by the pressure leakage condition. Therefore, pressure vessels using this composite material in comparison with conventional metal vessels can be applied in fields such as the defence industry, aerospace industry and rocket motor casings where light weight but resistance to high pressure are demanded. In this paper, a standard interpretation model for nonlinear finite element analysis of E-glass/epoxy filament wound around composite pressure vessels receiving an internal pressure is developed by using AN-SYS, general commercial software that has been verified as accurate, and useful characteristics of the solution are based on Auto LISP and ANSYS APDL. Both the pre-processor for exclusive analyses of filament wound composite pressure vessels and the post-processor that simplifies the results of this analysis have been developed to help the design engineers.

DT Article
AB The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) Combustion Research Laboratory focuses on non-invasive spectral techniques applied to flame sources. One of the tools used to monitor these sources is a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Interferometer. Previous work in this lab has identified various complications in using emission spectroscopy as an analysis tool on non-constant sources. This flicker, or pulsing, has been identified as interference frequencies in sources such as UALR's Hybrid Rocket plume. A mathematical model and simulation of the interaction between the interferometer and these interference frequencies has been developed using the software package MatLab. Using this simulation, predictions can be made concerning the amount of noise introduced into the IR signal due to source intensity fluctuations. A mathematical relationship has been discussed that maps the interference frequencies from the time domain of the interferogram to the frequency domain of the spectrum.

AB SKYLON is a single stage to orbit (SSTO) winged spaceplane designed to give routine low cost access to space. At a gross takeoff weight of 275 tonnes of which 220 tonnes is propellant the vehicle is capable of placing 12 tonnes into an equatorial low Earth orbit. The vehicle configuration consists of a slender fuselage containing the propellant tankage and payload bay with delta wings located midway along the fuselage carrying the SABRE engines in axisymmetric nacelles on the wingtips. The vehicle takes off and lands horizontally on it's own undercarriage. The fuselage is constructed as a multilayer structure consisting of aeroshell, insulation, structure and tankage. SKYLON employs extant or near term materials technology in order to minimise development cost and risk. The SABRE engines have a dual mode capability. In rocket mode the engine operates as a closed cycle liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen high specific impulse rocket engine. In airbreathing mode (from takeoff to Mach 5) the liquid oxygen flow is replaced by atmospheric air, increasing the installed specific impulse 3-6 fold. The airflow is drawn into the engine via a 2 shock axisymmetric intake and cooled to cryogenic temperatures prior to compression. The hydrogen fuel flow acts as a heat sink for the closed cycle helium loop before entering the main combustion chamber.

AB Current turbopump-based rocket-engine technology suffers from high cost and complexity, whereas pressurant-based rocket-engine technology suffers from the substantial weight of high-pressure propellant tanks. A new propellant pressurizer that solves these problems has been designed, built, and successfully tested. The pressurizer consists of three parts: a rotating cylindrical spindle containing a plethora of small transfer chambers, each transfer chamber acting as an individual pressure vessel and configured to fill with propellant at low pressure and drain propellant to the engine combustion chamber under the action of a high-pressure pressurant; and top and bottom chamber separators, each having a filling hole and a draining hole, the filling and draining holes aligned to create a filling and draining region between the chamber separators. The spindle is sandwiched with a good seal between the chamber separators such that, as the spindle rotates, each transfer chamber fills with propellant under low pressure in the filling region and subsequently drains of propellant under high pressure in the draining region. The successful test of the prototype demonstrated the ability of the design to match the performance of current turbopump-based systems at a fraction of the cost and weight.

ID PRESSURE OSCILLATIONS
AB Effects of various baffle designs on acoustic characteristics in combustion chamber are numerically investigated by adopting linear acoustic analysis. A hub-blade configuration with five blades is selected as a candidate baffle and five variants of baffles with various specifications are designed depending on baffle height and hub position. As damping parameters, natural-frequency shift and damping factor are considered and the damping capacity of various baffle designs is evaluated. Increase in baffle height results in more damping capacity and the hub position affects appreciably the damping of the first radial resonant mode. Depending on baffle height, two close resonant modes could be overlapped and thereby the damping factor for one resonant mode is increased exceedingly. The present procedure based on acoustic analysis is expected to be a useful tool to predict acoustic field in combustion chamber and to design the passive control devices such as baffle and acoustic resonator.

AB Improvements to spectral and temporal solar irradiances are often based upon increasingly accurate and precise measurements as well as upon better understood physics. This paper reports on one example in an emerging trend for solar irradiance models that can be characterized as hybrid irradiance modeling. Empirical and physics-based modeling of irradiances are combined and take advantage of strengths within both methods to provide a variety of solar irradiance products to science and engineering users. The SOLAR2000 (S2K) version 1.24 model (v1.24) described in this paper has gone through 17 upgrades since it was originally released in 1999 as v0.10 and now incorporates three theoretical continua, 13 rocket spectra, and time series data from five satellites using 17 instruments. S2K currently produces six integrated irradiance proxies for science and engineering applications in addition to spectrally resolved irradiances in three common wavelength formats. Integrated irradiance proxies include the E10.7 integrated EUV energy flux, Q(EUV) total thermospheric EUV heating rate, P-EUV hemispheric EUV power, T-infinity exospheric temperature, R-SN derived sunspot number, and S integrated spectrum. Besides three spectral wavelength and six integrated irradiance formats there are three time frames of historical, nowcast, and forecast irradiance products produced by four model grades. The Research Grade (RG) model is developed for aeronomical and climate change research, the Professional Grade (PG) model is developed for space system engineering applications, the Operational Grade (OP) model is developed for institutional and agency real-time operational space weather applications, and the System Grade (SY) model is developed for commercial operational and production applications. This report describes these model characteristics as well as the current state of operational irradiances which are now in the second release of a first generation forecast methodology. Forecast Generation 1x (FGen 1x) produces a 72-h forecast of E10.7 at high solar activity with 1-sigma uncertainties at the 8 % level. All SOLAR2000 irradiance products from each of the versions, grades, and forecast generations are compliant with the ISO CD 21348 solar irradiance draft standard being developed as a standard method to specify all solar irradiances for use by space systems and materials users.

AB Microgravity environment allows the study of the formation of zeolites and related materials under almost convection free conditions without the interference of phenomena related to density differences. Results obtained from Sounding Rocket microgravity experiments (MAXUS4 and MAXUS5) gave surprising insights into the mechanism of formation of zeolites with MFI topology. But these experiments also emphasized the need for longer duration missions. The opportunity of performing longer microgravity experiments oil zeolite structures was offered in the frame of a Taxi-Flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in November 2002 organized by Belgium and the European Space Agency (ESA). Two facilities were designed for this flight. During the development of these two experiments it could be demonstrated that the technical obstacles due to chemically aggressive media, high process temperatures, and pressures call be overcome. ESA is currently Studying the possibility of developing a dedicated insert for zeolite experiments to be used with the optical and diagnostic platform of the Protein Crystallisation Diagnostic Facility (PCDF) that will fly integrated in the European Drawer Rack oil the Columbus Laboratory starting in 2004. This paper presents recent experiences with zeolitization proceSSeS under inicrogravity conditions and tile opportunities for zeolite investigations aboard the International Space Station (ISS) offered by the new hardware.

DE space debris; environmentally-induced debris sources
AB Resident spacecraft and rocket bodies are known to spontaneously produce large fragments (>10 cm), usually released at low velocities in small numbers and normally exhibiting large area-to-mass ratios. Potential causes of these anomalous events, which are not related to the more dramatic satellite breakups, include material degradation due to environmental stresses and impact by small natural or man-made particles. An examination of known and previously undocumented anomalous events was undertaken to gain better insight into the frequency of such events and the resultant consequences to the overall orbital debris environment. Some space vehicle types, e.g., US Transit spacecraft and former Soviet Vostok orbital stages, demonstrate a propensity for debris generation, while other satellite designs appear less vulnerable. Some satellites are known to produce numerous debris over a period of many years, and the debris exhibit wide-ranging characteristics. It is concluded that such debris currently account for a small portion of the large orbital debris population, but the number of smaller debris cannot yet be estimated. Better identification and analysis of anomalous events might indicate the degree to which small particle impacts are responsible and whether the frequency of anomalous events in given orbital regimes can be used to monitor changes in the small particle population. Modifications to some satellite designs might mitigate anomalous event debris generation. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

AB This paper describes the methodology of the space debris proximity analysis in powered and orbital phase at the time of a satellite launch. The details of the SPADEPRO analysis package, developed for this purpose, are presented. It consists of modules which provide the functions related to ephemeris generation and reconstruction of primary object (launch vehicle or its payload upon insertion), determination of close approaches with resident space objects, computation of the state vector variance of the primary and the secondary objects to represent the knowledge uncertainty, and computation of the collision risk given the variance. This has been successfully applied during the recent launches of the Indian Space Research Organization. (C) 2004 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heavy-metal fluoride glasses are very promising optical fiber materials because of their predicted ultralow loss and long transparency range. Although conventional silica fibers have attained their theoretical minimum loss of 0.15dB/km, fluoride glasses have the potential to yield losses of only 0.001dB/km. Fluoride glasses also exhibit transparency into mid-IR frequencies, a region inaccessible to silica fibers. However, this group of glasses is very unstable to devitrification during both bulk glass synthesis and fiber-drawing. This instability has limited their commercial exploitation to a small niche market in the laser industry. The ZBLAN glass (53ZrF(4)-20BaF(2)-4LaF(3)-3AlF(3)-20NaF) is the most promising of these materials since its fiber-drawing region lies on the edge, or possibly just outside its crystallization region. It is believed that additional research into understanding the nucleation mechanics involved in the devitrification of fluoride glasses will lead to the development of technology to suppress such nucleation, or at least minimize the associated crystallization temperature region, allowing high optical quality fibers to be produced. It has recently been demonstrated that a microgravity environment can suppress devitrification in ZBLAN glass preform preparation, and that devitrification may be reduced when preparing ZBLAN terrestrially in a containerless facility. It is believed that the role of viscosity is critical in the devitrification mechanism of ZBLAN glass and in determining the optimum fiber-drawing temperature. Unfortunately, viscosity data for fluoride glasses are only available above the melting point and around the glass transition. A piezoelectric viscometer has been developed and is being used to determine the missing viscosity data in the fiber-drawing and crystallization temperature regions. Shear thinning of the glasses and/or the application of hydrostatic pressure on the glasses have been recently proposed to be responsible for devitrification during fiber-drawing at 1g and in reduced gravity. The study we report here is to explore the extent to which such a proposal is realistic.

AB A field microplot experiment was conducted in 1996 and 1997 to determine the influence of root-knot nematodes on intra- and interspecific interactions between chile pepper (chile) and spurred anoda and between chile and yellow or purple nutsedge (or both) using a substitution design. An additional objective was to determine the influence of London rocket, a winter annual and host plant for rootknot nematodes, on the inter- and intraspecific interactions between chile and spurred anoda. Twelve plant combinations were planted into paired 76-cm-diam microplots at a density of 24 plants per microplot each year. Each pair of microplots had one root-knot nematode-infested and one uninfested plot. One randomly selected plant pair or triplet from each plot was destructively sampled in June, July, August, and September each year. Data included leaf area, plant dry weights (leaf, stem, root or root plus rhizome, chile fruit, and nutsedge tuber), and nematode egg production from the belowground biomass of the different plant species within a 2,355-cm(3) sampled soil volume. Chile hosted the highest population of root-knot nematodes, followed by spurred anoda, purple nutsedge, and yellow nutsedge. Few root-knot nematode eggs were recovered from London rocket before incorporation into the microplots each spring. Root-knot nematode populations were higher in 1997 and, as a result, more interactions between nematodes and plant combinations were observed for chile. Spurred anoda and root-knot nematodes reduced chile shoot and root weights to levels not significantly different from zero in 1997. Yellow and purple nutsedge shoots, except for those from the original tuber, were removed throughout the season, and these species interfered less with chile. Spurred anoda was not affected by interspecific interference. Few interactions were observed between the spurred anoda plant combinations and root-knot nematodes. In June 1996, low populations of root-knot nematodes (< 4,000 eggs per gram of root) stimulated spurred anoda growth, but higher populations in June 1997 (> 30,000 eggs per gram of root) reduced spurred anoda growth. Prior presence of London rocket had little consistent influence on spurred anoda or chile. Yellow and purple nutsedge growth variables were affected by interference from chile and the other nutsedge species. Tuber number and tuber weight were higher when plants were infected with root-knot nematodes, particularly early in the season. The enhanced tuber production may increase early-season interference from nutsedge species under production conditions. The results suggest that the presence of root-knot nematodes influences plant interference, but the effect is species specific. Annual plants are affected differently compared with perennial nutsedges, possibly because of the continuous association between the perennials and the parasite.

AB We test the two simplest and most conceptually different return stroke models, the transmission line model (TLM) and the traveling current source model (TCSM), by comparing the first microsecond of model-predicted electric and magnetic field wave forms and field derivative wave forms at 15 m and 30 m with the corresponding measured wave forms from triggered lightning return strokes. In the TLM the return stroke process is modeled as a current wave injected at the base of the lightning channel and propagating upward along the channel with neither attenuation nor dispersion and at an assumed constant speed. In the TCSM the return stroke process is modeled as a current source traveling upward at an assumed constant speed and injecting a current wave into the channel, which then propagates downward at the speed of light and is absorbed at ground without reflection. The electric and magnetic fields were calculated from Maxwell's equations given the measured current or current derivative at the channel base, an assumed return stroke speed, and the temporal and spatial distribution of the channel current specified by the return stroke model. Electric and magnetic fields and their derivatives were measured 15 m and 30 m from rocket-triggered lightning during the summer of 2001 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding, Florida. We present data from a five-stroke flash, S0105, and compare the measured fields and field derivatives with the model-predicted ones for three assumed lightning return stroke speeds, v=1x10(8) m/s, v=2x10(8) m/s, and v=2.99x10(8) m/s ( essentially the speed of light). The results presented show that the TLM works reasonably well in predicting the measured electric and magnetic fields (field derivatives) at 15 m and 30 m if return stroke speeds during the first microsecond are chosen to be between 1x10(8) m/s and 2x10(8) m/s (near 2x10(8) m/s). In general, the TLM works better in predicting the measured field derivatives than in predicting the measured fields. The TCSM does not adequately predict either the measured electric fields or the measured electric and magnetic field derivatives at 15 and 30 m during the first microsecond or so.

TI A new explanation of persistent double meteor trains
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

ID 1998 LEONID SHOWER; MESOSPHERE; ADVECTION; LIDAR
AB Persistent meteor trains, studied for more than a century, remain somewhat mysterious [Newton, 1869; Trowbridge, 1907; Chapman, 1955; Hapgood, 1980]. The Leonids meteor showers of recent years afforded opportunities to apply new research technologies, including lidars and sophisticated cameras. Here we explore a particularly curious but common feature: double trains. Since the traditional hollow cylinder explanation has been shown to be untenable, we suggest a new explanation, arguing that one train is due to gaseous vapor train emissions behind the meteor while the other is due to heterogeneous chemistry associated with recoagulated dust. In this model the separation is caused by gravitational sedimentation of dust particles, an idea supported by rocket-based observations of recoagulated dust behind a meteor, by rocket-based observations of enhanced sodium emissions in a dust layer, by rocket observations of a dusty trail, and by recent theoretical estimates of chemical reactions on dust.

ID FUELS
AB High-energy density materials (HEDMs) are being investigated for use as propellants in rocket, air-breathing, and combined-cycle applications. These types of materials may be attractive alternatives to conventional propellants because of their high heat of combustion, density, and high strain energy. Because advanced propulsion systems may operate at very high pressure and temperature ( > 25 atm and temperatures exceeding 500 degreesC), the thermal decomposition of individual HEDMs is of interest to future fuel system designers. A laboratory-scale flow reactor was used to subject small amounts (approximately 1 ml) of deoxygenated HEDM to controlled conditions of temperature and residence-time-at-temperature at constant pressure (34 atm) in the liquid or supercritical phase. The reactor was 316 stainless steel HPLC tubing. Using an in-line analytical system, as well as off-line chromatographic analysis of products, the thermal stability of the parent material, as well as the thermal fragmentation products of each HEDM was measured. Some of the candidate materials tested (dimethyl-2-azidoethylamine (DAMEZ), quadricyclane, and bicyclopropylidene (BCP)) showed only marginal thermal stability with major decomposition occurring before 400 degreesC (similar to 3 s residence time). Other candidate materials (JP-10, RP-1, RG-1, RJ-6, and RJ-7) showed excellent thermal stability: little decomposition even at 600 degreesC. Results show the pyrolytic stability of candidate materials relative to each other, and provided insights to the mechanisms of thermal decomposition for specific fuel candidates.

AB Maraging steels possess ultrahigh strength combined with ductility and toughness and could be easily fabricated and heat-treated. Bulk metalworking of maraging steels is an important step in the component manufacture. To optimize the hot-working parameters (temperature and strain rate) for the ring rolling process of maraging steel used for the manufacture of rocket casings, a systematic study was conducted to characterize the hot working behavior by developing processing maps for gamma-iron and an indigenous 250 grade maraging steel. The hot deformation behavior of binary alloys of iron with Ni, Co, and Mo, which are major constituents of maraging steel, is also studied. Results from the investigation suggest that all the materials tested exhibit a domain of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). From the instability maps, it was revealed that strain rates above 10 s(-1) are not suitable for hot working of these materials. An important result from the stress-strain behavior is that while Co strengthens gamma-iron, Ni and Mo cause flow softening. Temperatures around 1125 degreesC and strain rate range between 0.001 and 0.1 s(-1) are suitable for the hot working of maraging steel in the DRX domain. Also, higher strain rates may be used in the meta-dynamic recrystallization domain above 1075 degreesC for high strain rate applications such as ring rolling. The microstructural mechanisms identified from the processing maps along with grain size analyses and hot ductility measurements could be used to design hot-working schedules for maraging steel.

AB Charles C. Lauritsen (1891-1968) was a leading American experimental nuclear physicist and government advisor. He emigrated from Denmark to the United States in 1916 with his wife and baby. In 1926 he talked his way into graduate study at Caltech. Within four years he completed a physics Ph.D. degree, built the world's highest voltage X-ray tube, and became a Caltech faculty member and director of the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory - founded to treat cancers with his X-ray tube. Converting one of his tubes into a particle accelerator, he became a nuclear physicist. During World War 11 he established and ran a large program for developing rocket munitions. After the war he advised government agencies on weapons development and research funding. He opposed the U.S. decision to develop the H-bomb. I discuss here his achievements, character, leadership, and the difficulties of science advising - especially evident in Project Vista.

AB Traditionally, the transient analysis of solid propellant grains subjected to ignition pressurization loading was not considered, and quasi-elastic-static analysis was widely adopted for structural integrity because the analytical task gets simplified. But it does not mean that the dynamic effect is not useful and could be neglected arbitrarily, and this effect usually plays a very important role for some critical design. In order to simulate the dynamic response for solid rocket motor, a transient finite element model, accompanied by concepts of time-temperature shift principle, reduced integration and thermorheologically simple material assumption, was used. For studying the dynamic response, diverse ignition pressurization loading cases were used and investigated in the present paper. Results show that the dynamic effect is important for structural integrity of solid propellant grains under ignition pressurization loading. Comparing the effective stress of transient analysis and of quasi-elastic-static analysis, one can see that there is an obvious difference between them because of the dynamic effect. From the work of quasi-elastic-static and transient analyses, the dynamic analysis highlighted several areas of interest and a more accurate and reasonable result could be obtained for the engineer.

AB The flow field, that develops when a moving shock wave hits a two-phase medium of gas and particles, has a practical application to industrial accidents such as explosions at coal mine and in grain elevator and furthermore to solid propellant combustion in rocket engine. Therefore, a successful prediction of the thermo-fluid mechanical characteristics development of gas and particles is very crucial and imperative for the successful design and operation of rocket nozzles and energy conversion systems. This paper describes an interaction phenomenon when a moving shock wave hits a two-phase medium of gas and particles with/without chemical reaction. A particle-laden gas is considered to be located along a ramp so that numerical integration is accomplished from the tip of ramp for a finite period. For the numerical solution, a fully conservative unsteady implicit second order time-accurate sub-iteration method and the second order Total Variation Diminishing scheme are used with the finite volume method for gas phase. For particle phase, the Monotonic Upstream Schemes for Conservation Laws as well as the solution of the Riemann problem for the particle motion equations is also used together with the schemes above. Transient development of thermo-fluid mechanical characteristics is calculated and discussed by changing the particle mass density and particle specific heat. For the case of the reacting particle-laden gas flow, a carbon particle-laden oxygen gas is considered to be located along a ramp. The results are discussed by comparison with the cases of the pure gas and the inert particle-laden gas. Major results reveal that when the particle mass density is smaller, there is a stronger interaction between two phases so that the velocity and temperature differences between two phases more rapidly decrease. When the particle specific heat is varied, only a thermal effect is observed while the other effects are minor. The case with reacting particles yields significantly different results due to chemical reaction such that the gas density does not monotonously but rapidly decrease due to the slip line in the relaxation zone, while the pressure and temperature become higher in comparison with the non-reacting case. But the dynamic variation would be only secondary to the thermal one. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) should be sized to minimise the specific launch costs and this probably means a payload around 10 tonnes and the 4.5 m diameter envelope, both similar to the Space Shuttle capability. This sizing means large payloads, in particular orbital infrastructure systems, if launched on the RLV would have to be carried in many pieces and assembled in orbit. It has been argued that while this approach leads to the lowest launch cost the savings are lost in the extra costs imposed on other factors in the overall acquisition cost. Using a Heavy Lift Vehicle (HLV) with high specific launch costs but able to launch the system in one piece would lead to lower overall acquisition costs. The paper explores the requirements for an HLV designed to support an RLV and proposes a payload of around 40 tonnes and a diameter of 7 meters. It explores three candidate systems Ariane 5 with enlarge payload fairing, an HLV variant of the Space Shuttle and a new reusable system. The most cost effective is the new system but its economic risk and acquisition cost is clearly not sustainable in parallel with an RLV development. However both Ariane 5 and a Shuttle based system could be used as transition launchers for the early stages of RLV operations, with a new HLV system development following when its market is established.

AB In the application of adaptive flight control, significant issues arise due to limitations in the plant inputs, such as actuator displacement limits, actuator rate limits, linear input dynamics, and time delay. A method is introduced that allows an adaptive law to be designed for the system without these input characteristics and then to be applied to the system with these characteristics, without affecting adaptation. This includes allowing correct adaptation while the plant input is saturated and allows the adaptation law to function when not actually in control of the plant. To apply the method, estimates of actuator positions must be found. However, the adaptation law can correct for errors in these estimates. Proof of boundedness of system signals is provided for a single hidden-layer perceptron neural network adaptive law. Simulation results utilizing the methods introduced for neural network adaptive control of a reusable launch vehicle are presented for nominal flight and under failure cases that require considerable adaptation.

TI Measurement of the division of lightning return stroke current among the
   multiple arresters and grounds of a power distribution line
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY
LA English
DT Article
DE grounding electrodes; lightning; MOV arresters; power distribution lines
AB A triggered-lightning experiment was conducted during Summer 2000 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) in north-central Florida for the purpose of studying the lightning current division in an 829-m-long, 18-pole, three-phase plus neutral, unenergized, overhead distribution line equipped with six arrester stations. Eight lightning flashes containing a total of 34 recorded return strokes, as well as low amplitude, long duration steady currents, were artificially initiated (triggered) from natural thunderclouds using the rocket-and-wire technique, and the flash currents were directed to phase C (one of the two outer conductors of the three-phase cross-arm-configured line). Six of the eight triggered lightning flashes caused damage to one of the two closest phase C arresters. In the case when no arrester was damaged or was not yet damaged by current in the flash, it is inferred that about 40% of the return stroke peak current and about 25% or more of the return stroke charge transferred in the first millisecond passed to the neutral conductor through each of the two closest arresters located about 70 m away on either side of the strike point. The bulk of the peak current then flowed from the neutral conductor to ground through the groundings of the two closest arresters. The charge transferred in the first millisecond from the neutral to the eight system groundings, six at arrester stations, and one at each of the two line-end poles, appears to be distributed inversely to the low-frequency, low-current grounding resistances. From our measurements of return stroke current division and in view of the available data on the currents of first strokes in natural lightning, we estimate that over half of natural first strokes would result in an arrester failure in our test distribution line, which is representative of some distribution lines in service, within about 450 mus of the initiation of the first return stroke current flow, in the absence of flashovers and other alternative current paths that might be provided by transformers or underground cable connections to allow the stroke current to bypass the arrester. Additional first stroke current flow beyond about 450 mus and currents associated with subsequent strokes and potentially other processes should further increase the likelihood of arrester damage.

AB An experiment is conducted to study the thrust conversion process of a laser fusion rocket (LFR) in a scaled-down manner. The temporal evolution of laser-produced plasma clouds (LPC) expanding in a dipole magnetic field is examined and the thrust conversion efficiency is estimated. For comparative purposes, numerical analyses of plasma behaviour in a dipole magnetic field are also performed using a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) code. An overall good agreement between the experimental and simulation data is found. It is also found that a thrust conversion efficiency as high as 60% is possible in the scaled-down model considered here. The experiments will be very useful in developing LFR designs and testing the basic features of the large-scale simulative LFR experiments proposed for the National Ignition Facility (NIF).

TI Heat transfer amplification due to transverse mode oscillations
SO JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER

DT Article
ID BURNER; TUBE; AIR
AB The goal of this research is to estimate the magnitude of heat transfer amplification due to combustion instability in the first tangential mode. A theoretical investigation introduced a model consisting of a quasi-steady-state description of the oscillating flow. An experimental facility was constructed, and a few sets of experiments were conducted. The results show that transverse pressure oscillations can increase heat transfer to the walls up to about twofold for pressure oscillations of 50% of the mean pressure. Thus, substantial amplification of heat transfer should be expected in combustors operating under instability conditions. This effect may be particularly crucial in liquid-propellant rocket engines.

AB Due to their high specific impulse, Oxygen/Hydrogen systems are often used to increase launcher performance and will probably continue to be the preferred option for the next decades. In order to get insight into complex processes involved in the combustion of such propellants, research efforts have been conducted in both France and Germany including theoretical and experimental activities. This article deals with recent progess achieved by research teams from both countries in high pressure Oxygen/Hydrogen (O-2/H-2) combustion systems. In France, the research program was conducted in the framework of the GDR group including Snecma Moteurs-Rocket Engine Division, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and ONERA. In Germany, research was conducted in the framework of the national technology program "TEKAN" involving universities, DLR and Astrium. A close cooperation between teams was made possible through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on research on high pressure cryogenic combustion.
   First, general design issues of liquid propellant engines are addressed, demonstrating a clear need for a new approach in engine development taking into account the complex chemical and physical processes in rocket engines. A brief description about the organization of the research programs is followed by a short presentation of the test facilities and the experimental setup's in use. Examples of experimental as well as numerical achievements applying sophisticated optical diagnostic tools are discussed and finally, the paper summarises the results achieved so far and addresses the questions still open.

AB This paper describes a method for measuring the mass of cryogenic fluids in on-board rocket propellant tanks or ground storage tanks. Linear approximations to the Clausius-Mossotti relationship serve as the foundation for a capacitance based mass sensor, regardless of fluid density stratification or tank shape. Sensor design considerations are presented along with the experimental results for a capacitance based mass gage tested in liquid nitrogen. This test data is shown to be consistent with theory resulting in a demonstrated mass measurement accuracy of +/-0.75% and a deviation from linearity of less than +/-0.30% of full scale mass. Theoretical accuracies are also shown to be +/-0.73% for hydrogen and +/-1.39% for oxygen for a select range of pressures and temperatures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding the complex environment of rocket chambers involves a good knowledge of injection phenomena and gives the designer the ability to employ time and cost saving modeling tools to design a higher performance engine. This project looked at injection processes in the supercritical regime using cryogenic nitrogen. Experimental data taken by 2-D Raman imaging allowed the comparison of density and divergence angels with computational models. These parameters provide much information about the jet development and mixing with the surrounding gas. The process used to derive divergence angles from Raman images proves difficult to compare directly with other techniques.

AB As satellite payload electrical power system requirements continue to grow, satellite systems employing flat panel arrays have reached limits set by either on-orbit dynamics that limit the size and shape of the deployed array, mass constraints set by the launch vehicle, or by the limits set by the volume constraints of the launch shroud. This has caused several satellite programs to approach power margin limits early in the design cycle, and to either compromise on satellite capabilities or perform costly redesigns. A very leveraging parameter for raising satellite power levels and reducing costs is the efficiency of the solar cells employed by satellite systems. State of the art efficiencies have reached 26.5% efficiency at load, and 30.1% for prototype cells, and solar arrays using GaAs based multijunction solar cells have achieved deployed solar array power densities of 70 W/kg and stowed volume power densities of 8 kW/m(3). A simplified approach to the unwieldy dark current electrical analysis of multijunction solar cells has been developed, correlated with the performance of dual and triple junction solar cells, and explains ideality factors and reverse saturation currents that appear large. It was found that introducing a fourth junction with modest performance could raise the efficiency of multijunction solar cells to 31.5% efficiency at load, raise total power levels to 22 kW, raise the power densities to 100 W/kg and 9 kW/m(3) with no impact to the configuration or operation of satellite solar arrays.

AB NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) calls for investments in Space Shuttle safety upgrades, second generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) advanced development and third generation RLV and in-space research and technology. NASA's third generation launch systems are to be fully reusable and operational by 2025. The goals for third generation launch systems are to reduce cost by a factor of 100 and improve safety by a factor of 10,000 over current systems. The Advanced Space Transportation Program Office (ASTP) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL has the agency lead to develop third generation space transportation technologies. The Hypersonics Investment Area, part of ASTP, is developing the third generation launch vehicle technologies in two main areas, propulsion and airframes. The program's major investment is in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion since it offers the greatest potential for meeting the third generation launch vehicles. The program will mature the technologies in three key propulsion areas, scramjets, rocket-based combined cycle and turbine-based combination cycle. Ground and flight propulsion tests are being planned for the propulsion technologies. Airframe technologies will be matured primarily through ground testing.
   This paper describes NASA's activities in hypersonics. Current programs, accomplishments, future plans and technologies that are being pursued by the Hypersonics Investment Area under the Advanced Space Transportation Program Office will be discussed.

AB The paper presents the analysis of space transportation cost development for the geosynchronous orbit (GEO). While the launch cost increased subtancially since 1963 - the launch year of the first GEO satellite - the satellite mass increased from 36 kg to more than 2800 kg in GEO (BoM). Thus the specific cost (launch cost per kg or per channel) have dramatically been reduced from 550 000 $/kg to only 36 000 $/kg in 2002. The reason, however, is almost only the Jaw of scale", i.e. the increased payload mass, but not improvement of the launch systems. An further cost reduction on the launch vehicle side is possible by the introduction of reusable launch systems (RLVs) by a factor 2 to 4, depending on the vehicle design concept.

ID CALIBRATION
AB VIRTIS-M is a visible-infrared (VIS-IR) image spectrometer designed for the Rosetta mission; it intends to provide detailed informations on the physical, chemical, and mineralogical nature of comets and asteroids. The in-flight performances of VIRTIS-M are expected to be influenced by various disturbances, like the initial strong vibrations of the rocket, the long duration of the experiment (from 2003 to 2010), as well as other possible environmental changes; therefore, an in-flight recalibration procedure is mandatory. Quite often in such kinds of missions, a light emission diode (LED) is employed to calibrate the on-board spectrometers by taking advantage of the relative small dimensions, stability, and hardness of these sources. VIRTIS-M is the first image spectrometer that will use a new generation of lamps for internal calibrations. These new lamps are characterized by a wide spectral range with a blackbody-like emission with an effective temperature of about (2400-2600 K), thereby covering the whole VIRTIS-M's spectral range (0.2-5 mum); i.e., they offer the possibility of a wider spectral calibration in comparison with the quasimonochromatic LED emission. A precise spectral calibration is achieved by adding special filters for visible and infrared ranges in front of the window source, containing many narrow absorption lines. In the present article, we describe the calibration and tests of some flight prototypes of these lamps (VIS and IR), realized by the Officine Galileo and calibrated by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche-Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.

SO ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS

DT Article
ID SPRAY CHARACTERISTICS; ATOMIZATION; PRESSURE
AB Experimental studies have been conducted on a new type of injector which can be used very advantageously in rocket engines designed for throttling applications. The aim is to keep the drop size constant for varying chamber pressures. The injector uses very small quantities of a gas to atomize a straight liquid jet before discharging into the combustion chamber. The concept is demonstrated over an eightfold variation of injector pressure drop. A feedback control system, which can regulate the air pressure with respect to the sensed chamber pressure, based on the input transfer function, so as to keep the drop size constant, is suggested. The transfer function is obtained from the experimental data. The major advantage of this injector is that it uses a very small quantity of gas, thereby limiting the weight penalty to a minimum. This system is much less complicated compared to variable area injector and cavitating venturi valves used for this purpose.

AB Chemical processes are central to the comprehension of rocket and missile exhaust structure. Afterburning of superstoichiometric, reduced products drives heating beyond the nozzle. Trace metals can suppress radical cycling intensities and simultaneously act as the source of ionization. Particles inorganic and otherwise undergo fluid slip and thereby impact heat and momentum budgets. All radiation interactions of the plume are intimately coupled into this rich chemical environment. Several atomic and chemiluminescent spectra appear in the submicron range. A variety of particulate types glow as continuum blackbodies in the infrared. Subject to quantum mechanical restrictions, major and trace gases emit as well. Radio frequencies are attenuated by the weak plasma and may also be generated where charge separation and turbulence conjoin. Renewed interest in missile defense will motivate refinements in plume detection, particularly for the boost phase. We review current theory and modeling of exhaust chemistry in order to anticipate next-generation computations required to guide the sensor community. A variety of organic, composite, and liquid fuel types is described along with the dopants that can be introduced. Chemical behavior is outlined within thecombustion chamber and through the nozzle expansion zone. A brief history of exhaust kinetics modeling is then provided. Increasing complexity of reaction lists, integrators, and coupling to fluid dynamics are stressed. Parameterized submechanisms are recommended relevant to the major radiation interaction types. The nonequilibrium aerosol is dealt with over a range of compositions and sizes. We conclude by organizing a list of potential research priorities. Due to computational intensity and interdisciplinarity of the plume chemistry problem, cross-institutional programs are advised. Increased reaction detail should improve the performance of existing kinetics routines and lead also to convergence. Automation of chemistry setup and optimization of numerics will facilitate sensitivity tests and reaction tailoring. Multifluid hydrodynamics and gaseous electronic calculations may yield insights on radio frequency emissions from the backstreaming and Mach diamond regimes.

AB It is a common practice for cryogenic turbomachines to utilize stiffly mounted bearings due to the incapability of providing significant damping with conventional methods and designs. With no damping available, the historical motive behind this design practice was to elevate all critical speeds above the maximum running speed. The desire for higher energy density has raised the running speeds of rocket engine turbopumps very near, or even above, the first three critical speeds. A companion paper gives experimental evidence that accurate prediction of these critical speeds with the turbopump rotor on ball bearings with stiff supports is not practically possible. The feasibility of applying a metal mesh damper with soft supports in a cryogenic engine is investigated. To date the focus has been on cryogenic experimental tests, rotordynamic simulations, and possible bearing support design schemes to justify the incorporation of a metal mesh bearing support in a liquid rocket engine fuel turbopump. Success of the design. is dependent on the amount of damping that the damper retains at cryogenic temperatures and its ultimate effect on fuel turbopump rotordynamics, especially subsynchronous instability.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
AB This paper discusses the evolution of the American Rocket Society and its experimental programs from the early liquid rocket launches, through static firings of engines, to the experimental aerodynamic development of rocket shapes. The American Rocket Society was founded in 1930 as the American Interplanetary Society by a small group of science-fiction writers who were intrigued by the concept of interplanetary travel or space flight. A short time after its forming, the interplanetary society had become a more down-to-Earth organization. Within a matter of months, a "program of research on the rocket and its possibilities" had been undertaken. Out of this initiative and a trip by one, of the founding members to visit the German Interplanetary Society, the Verein fur Raumschiffahrt E. V. Geschaftsstelle Berlin in 1931, the experimental committee of the American Interplanetary Society was born. The experimental committee would develop five rockets, of which three would actually fly. Their most important contribution to rocketry at the time was the development of an experimental test stand, later used by one of America's first rocket manufacturing companies, Reaction Motors Inc. Four members of the American Rocket Society's experimental committee would be the founders of this company. The experimental phase of the American Interplanetary Society and later the American Rocket Society lasted only about 10 years but led to the advancement of rocket science. American Interplanetary Society's scope had moved far from its origins as group of space enthusiasts to amateur experimenters to the country's leading technical society for rocketry and jet propulsion.

AB The history of the development of U.S. Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles is briefly discussed. Emphasis is placed on the technical challenges and the achievements made by the intercontinental ballistic missile team over the past 56 years. The discussion covers all important subsystems in the construction of an intercontinental ballistic missile, that is, rocket propulsion, missile basing, guidance/control, and reentry systems. One of the most remarkable accomplishments of the program is its actual service life, which has far exceeded the original design requirements and goals. The intercontinental ballistic missile program has been one of the most successful programs in the history of the Department of Defense. Besides achieving its nuclear deterrence mission and helping the United States win the Cold War, the intercontinental ballistic missile program also made pivotal contributions in the early stages of the space race with the former Soviet Union. Technologies developed by the intercontinental ballistic missile program have also contributed to nonmilitary and scientific application. Notable examples are miniaturized, high-speed computer chips, composite materials, and high-temperature thermal protection systems.

AB The history of the development of U.S. Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles is briefly discussed. Emphasis is placed on the technical challenges and the achievements made by the intercontinental ballistic missile team over the past 56 years. The discussion covers all important subsystems in the construction of an intercontinental ballistic missile, that is, rocket propulsion, missile basing, guidance/control, and reentry systems. One of the most remarkable accomplishments of the program is its actual service life, which has far exceeded the original design requirements and goals. The intercontinental ballistic missile program has been one of the most successful programs in the history of the Department of Defense. Besides achieving its nuclear deterrence mission and helping the United States win the Cold War, the intercontinental ballistic missile program also made pivotal contributions in the early stages of the space race with the former Soviet Union. Technologies developed by the intercontinental ballistic missile program have also contributed to nonmilitary and scientific application. Notable examples are miniaturized, high-speed computer chips, composite materials, and high-temperature thermal protection systems.

AB Theoretical emission-line ratios involving transitions in the 236-412 Angstrom wavelength range are presented for the Na-like ions Ar viii, Cr xiv, Mn xv, Fe xvi, Co xvii, Ni xviii and Zn xx. A comparison of these with an extensive data set of the solar active region, quiet-Sun, subflare and off-limb observations, obtained during rocket flights by the Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS), reveals generally very good agreement between theory and experiment. This indicates that most of the Na-like ion lines are reliably detected in the SERTS observations, and hence may be employed with confidence in solar spectral analyses. However, the features in the SERTS spectra at 236.34 and 300.25 Angstrom, originally identified as the Ni xviii 3p (2) P-3/2 -3d (2) D-3/2 and Cr xiv 3p (2) P-3/2 -3d (2) D-5/2 transitions, respectively, are found to be due to emission lines of Ar xiii (236.34 Angstrom) and possibly S v or Ni vi (300.25 Angstrom). The Co xvii 3s (2) S-3p (2) P-3/2 line at 312.55 Angstrom is always badly blended with an Fe xv feature at the same wavelength, but Mn xv 3s (2) S-3p (2) P-1/2 at 384.75 Angstrom may not always be as affected by second-order emission from Fe xii 192.37 Angstrom as previously thought. On the other hand, we find that the Zn xx 3s (2) S-3p (2) P-3/2 transition can sometimes make a significant contribution to the Zn xx/Fe xiii 256.43- Angstrom blend, and hence care must be taken when using this feature as an Fe xiii electron density diagnostic. A line in the SERTS-89 active region spectrum at 265.00 Angstrom has been re-assessed, and we confirm its identification as the Fe xvi 3p (2) P-3/2 -3d (2) D-3/2 transition.

AB Our knowledge of the physics of positive lightning remains much poorer than that of negative lightning. Many questions regarding the genesis of positive lightning and its properties cannot be answered without further research. It is worth noting that attempts to initiate positive lightning using the rocket-and-wire technique generally result in discharges that are composed of the initial stage (relatively low-level, long-lasting current component) that is not followed by positive leader/return-stroke sequences. Bipolar lightning is an even less understood and often unrecognized phenomenon. While some simple cloud charge distributions, such as a "tilted dipole," an "inverted dipole," or a "positive monopole," can apparently explain the generation of positive lightning, the occurrence of bipolar lightning, as well as complex cloud discharges, suggests that the cloud charge structure cannot always be described by simple, vertically stacked charge models. It is likely that positively and negatively charged regions can exist at about the same height in the cloud.

AB DLR-TUBSAT is a microsatellite joint project of the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Technical University of Berlin (TUB) and the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). It was launched on 26 March 1999 with the Indian Polar Spacecraft Launch Vehicle (PSLV) as secondary payload. DLR-TUBSAT was designed for interactive earth observation where the target is not identified in advance, a search action is involved or a target has to be visually followed. Whereas classical earth observation uses nadir pointing satellites the design of DLR-TUBSAT was made for using interactive control strategies. Since the start of the operation many different strategies for different acquisition and operation modes are developed and tested. A result of this development are new software programs on satellite and ground segment and new ground control procedures. Possible applications of the produced earth observation data could be defined and were integrated in the new control strategies. DLR-TUBSAT showed that it can serve new market areas of earth observation and new customers, which can not use or do not want to use classical earth observation satellites. The main advantages are the interactive search abilities, very high repeat cycles (I day) and the low mass and low costs of the satellite system. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Toroidal plasma thruster for deep space flights
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICS; TOKAMAK; TFTR
AB A conceptual, theoretical assessment of using the toroidal fusion reactor, tokamak, for deep space interplanetary and interstellar missions is presented. Toroidal thermonuclear fusion reactors, such as tokamaks and stellarators, are unique for space propulsion, allowing a design with the magnetic configuration localized inside the toroidal magnetic field coils. Plasma energetic ions, including charged fusion products, can escape such closed configuration at certain conditions as a result of vertical drift in the toroidal rippled magnetic field. Escaping particles can be used for direct propulsion (because toroidal drift is directed one way vertically) or to create and heat externally confined plasma, so that the latter can be used for propulsion. In contrast to other fusion concepts proposed for space propulsion, this concept utilizes the natural drift motion of charged particles out of the closed magnetic field configuration. Also, using deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasma is a novel way to use fusion neutrons with the energy of 14 MeV for direct propulsion ("neutron rocket") for out of solar system missions. A special design of the blanket of the reactor allows neutrons to escape the device in a preferable direction. This provides a direct (partial) conversion of fusion energy into thrust.

AB Back in 1993, when this author was able to acquire one of the first US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) documents declassified on the Soviet Space Program [1], there was a dearth of materials concerning the USSR's space activities from a US intelligence perspective. Now, a decade on, the situation has dramatically changed. As a plethora of US government agencies labor to disgorge their materials from the era of the Cold War, space historians and observers now have access to many new documents, which shed both exciting and new light on Soviet space activities, and how the US viewed as well as interpreted them. Coupled with the fact that many of these are now available to be read via the Internet, and with most of the documents available only recently, a new era in space history research is now in hand. This article is intended to provide a broad overview of what is now available, and mention some highlights.

TI Scalability for rocket nozzle flows based on subscale and full-scale
   testing
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB When flow separation and side-load behavior is investigated for different nozzle concepts or when design considerations for advanced nozzle concepts are experimentally screened, the initial experimental effort is generally limited to subscale experiments with high-quality diagnostics. However, one fundamental question always arises: How should these test results be scaled to a potential full-scale design or application? Different approaches exist, including the use of characteristic numbers for normalization and analytical and numerical models. It is shown that analytical models, being based on physical origins and dominated by inviscid flow phenomena, may result in high accuracy for full-scale prediction. In contrast, it is shown that for flow regions dominated by viscous effects significant differences between cold- and hot-gas experiments are observed, which makes a direct scaling from cold-gas subscale to hot-gas full-scale difficult. For scaling, an intermediate step in the scaling rationale with hot-firing tests is foreseen. Demonstrated by results from hot-firing tests with Vulcain subscale nozzles, it is shown that a geometrical scaling is possible for similar hot-gas flow properties. These test results, obtained with a 40-kN thrust chamber at representative combustion chamber operation conditions, are presented and discussed in detail.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

AB Understanding the unsteady aspects of turbine rotor flowfields is critical to successful future turbine designs. A technology program was conducted at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center to increase the understanding of unsteady environments for rocket engine turbines. The experimental program involved instrumenting turbine rotor blades with miniature surface-mounted high-frequency response pressure transducers. The turbine model was then tested to measure the unsteady pressures on the rotor blades. The data obtained from the experimental program are unique in two respects. First, much more unsteady data were obtained (several minutes per set point) than have been possible in the past. Also, an extensive steady performance database existed for the turbine model. This allowed an evaluation of the effect of the onblade instrumentation on the turbine's performance. A three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes analysis was also used to predict blindly the unsteady flowfield in the turbine at the design operating conditions and at +15 deg relative incidence to the first-stage rotor. The predicted time-averaged and unsteady pressure distributions show good agreement with the experimental data. This unique data set, the lessons learned for acquiring this type of data, and the improvements made to the data analysis and prediction tools are contributing significantly to current space launch initiative turbine airflow test and blade surface pressure prediction efforts.

TI Effect of nozzle cavity on resonance in large SRM: Numerical Simulations
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID SOLID ROCKET MOTORS; OSCILLATIONS; INSTABILITY; SOUND
AB The nozzle design effect on sound production is investigated to improve the understanding of the aeroacoustic coupling that occurs in solid rocket motors with a submerged nozzle. Earlier analytical and experimental work demonstrated that flow-acoustic coupling is observed only for submerged nozzles for which the sound pressure level increases linearly with the nozzle cavity volume. Numerical simulations of the flow-acoustic coupling phenomena and in particular of the effect of the nozzle cavity volume on the pressure pulsations are performed using the code CPS. The numerical and experimental pressure spectra are compared. The frequencies are well simulated by the numerical code even if the pressure levels are overestimated. The nozzle design effect on sound production is also observed with a reduction of pressure level of 55% when the nozzle cavity is removed. Furthermore, the nozzle cavity modifies the flowfield around the nozzle head. With the cavity, the recirculation bubble is shorter, and the flow close to the nozzle head presents high amplitudes of radial mean velocity and fluctuation. That explains why the vortices break up when interacting with the nozzle head. With the cavity, the vortices shed by the inhibitor move along the border of the recirculation bubble and then pass in front of the cavity entrance, where they generate sound by interacting with the velocity fluctuations induced by the cavity volume. This results in a strong interaction between the vortices and the nozzle, which leads to large pressure oscillations.

AB Two important objectives for the development of a second-generation reusable launch vehicle are concerned with significantly reducing cost and risk. Meeting these objectives requires a progressive design approach that eliminates noncompetitive designs as early in the process as possible. During these early stages, designs are usually, evaluated at a low-fidelity conceptual level. Nevertheless, design decisions need to be made that significantly affect both cost and risk. Thus, it is crucial that both of these factors are considered during conceptual design. Methods to facilitate system risk assessment and risk vs cost allocation during the conceptual design of an aerospace system are presented. The analysis and optimization take into account the uncertainties in design variables that have important effects on safety, performance, and cost. The proposed methodology is illustrated. for the geometry design of a reuseable launch vehicle.

ID SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; ENERGETIC MATERIALS
AB There is an increasing interest in research and development of ecofriendly solid propellant systems which can replace the existing ones in applications particularly where the rockets have to be fired in close proximity of the personnel and smokeless HCl-free burning is desired. Ammonium nitrate (AN) is receiving wide attention as a possible substitute for ammonium perchlorate oxidizer in view of the hazardous nature of other candidates like nitramines and non-availability of substances like ammonium dinitramide in requisite quantities besides the cost effectiveness. The phase transitions and initial endothermic decomposition of ammonium nitrate, however, pose problems in its application in composite solid rocket propellants. The influence of pressure on phase transitions, melting and thermal decomposition characteristics of AN is required to be systematically studied in order to have an insight in the combustion mechanism of AN containing propellants. Pressure differential scanning calorimetric (PDSC) studies have consequently been conducted on pure AN under ambient conditions and up to a maximum inert pressure of 68.03 atm. The shifts in the phase transition peaks, melting and decomposition temperatures with pressure have been studied. It has been observed that thermal decomposition of AN remains an endothermic process up to a pressure of 20.41 atm and thereafter becomes exothermic in nature. Phase transitions, melting and decomposition processes are found to be pressure sensitive and the associated peaks register a positive temperature shift bearing a relationship with crystal structure in two distinct pressure segments corresponding to endo- and exothermic decomposition.

ID RESINS
AB Unsaturated polyesters have proved their potential for inhibition of double-base (DB) and composite modified double-base (CMDB) rocket propellants but usually suffer from slightly higher nitroglycerine (NG) absorption and lower flame retardant characteristics. This requires tailoring of their properties through different techniques. This review summarizes different techniques for this purpose and presents the data generated. The present status of these tailored/modified systems is also discussed in detail followed by future scope of research in this field.

TI Stabilization of a solid propellant rocket instability by state feedback
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE backstepping; boundary control; solid propellant rockets
AB In this paper a globally stabilizing feedback boundary control law for an arbitrarily fine discretization of a one-dimensional nonlinear PDE model of unstable burning in solid propellant rockets is presented. The PDE has a destabilizing boundary condition imposed on one part of the boundary. We discretize the original nonlinear PDE model in space using finite difference approximation and get a high order system of coupled nonlinear ODEs. Then, using backstepping design for parabolic PDEs, properly modified to accommodate the imposed destabilizing nonlinear boundary condition at the burning end, we transform the original system into a target system that is asymptotically stable in l(2)-norm with the same type of boundary condition at the burning end, and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition at the control end.

TI Layered phenomena in the mesopause region - Foreword
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
LA English
DT Article
ID MESOSPHERE SUMMER ECHOES; POLAR MESOSPHERE; NOCTILUCENT CLOUDS; AEROSOLS
AB Layered phenomena in the mesopause region is the subject of an international working group whose main focus concerns the physics and chemistry of the summertime mesosphere and the processes involved in forming polar mesospheric summertime echoes (PMSEs) and polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs)-the global equivalent to ground observer's noctilucent clouds (NLCs). PMCs are ice clouds that occur in the summer mesosphere at altitudes typically between 81 and 86 km, and poleward of 50 degrees latitude. PMSEs are strong backscattered signals from the summer mesosphere region, recorded largely, although not exclusively, by VHF radars, that occur most often poleward of 50 degrees latitude and at altitudes typically between 82 and 88 km. The major areas of research within this working group involve understanding and numerically modeling the dynamical, thermal, and chemical processes related to the summer mesosphere; microphysical modeling of MCs; determining the scattering, composition, and shape of mesospheric particles; resolving sources of condensation nuclei; performing laboratory experiments of relevant reactions and related constituents involved in PMC and PMSE behavior, and determining the properties and conditions of PMC, PMSE, and the summer mesosphere by making rocket, satellite, and ground-based radar and lidar measurements.

DT Article
AB A space mission consists of more than just a spacecraft and scientific instruments. It also includes a ground system to support communications, command and telemetry processing and archiving, a mission operations team, and a launch vehicle. Before launch, all of these elements must be tested together in an integrated fashion. The Mission System Engineer is the chief architect of this system, is responsible for all technical aspects of the entire system, and directs trade studies to determine the partitioning of functions among subsystems and elements of the entire system. The TIMED mission and system were designed around a concept of low-cost mission operations. This concept was realized through the creation of a highly autonomous spacecraft, instrument operations that are decoupled from spacecraft operations, and payload (instrument) operations centers that are geographically distributed and connected through the Internet.

AB Considering the characteristics of the plume temperature measurement of solid propellant rocket engine, a new emissivity assumption was presented. Based on the assumption, a new data processing method of the multiwavelength pyrometer was introduced. By processing the measured data of the multiwavelength pyrometer at two different time, the true temperatures and spectral emissivities at two different time can be simultaneously calculated. The experimental results show that the temperature differences between the calculated values and the theoretical ones provided by the rocket engine designer are within +/-20K. The above-mentioned method is a practical data processing method of solid propellant rocket engine plume temperature.

ID SOUND-ABSORPTION; ENCLOSURE
AB Loudspeakers tuned as optimal acoustic absorbers can significantly reduce damaging, low frequency, reverberant noise in a full-scale launch vehicle fairing. Irregular geometry, changing payloads, and the compliant nature of the fairing hinder effective implementation of a passively tuned loudspeaker. A method of tuning the loudspeaker dynamics in real time is required to meet the application requirements. Through system identification, the dynamics of the enclosure can be identified and used to tune the dynamics of the loudspeaker for reduction of targeted, high intensity, low-frequency modes that dominate the acoustic response in the fairing. A loudspeaker model With desired dynamics serves as the reference model in a control law designed to tune the dynamics, of a non-ideal loudspeaker to act as an optimal tuned absorber. Experimental results indicate that a tuned loudspeaker placed in the nose cone of the fairing significantly reduces acoustic energy and verifies results calculated fro in the simulation.

AB The combustion temperature is one of the important parameters to express flame combustion and explosion characteristics. It will effectively guide the design and manufacture of new model explosives, industrial explosive materials, and weapons. The recent developments and applications of real time diagnostics of instantaneous temperature of combustion and explosion processes by modem spectroscopic methods, such as atomic absorption-emission method, atomic emission two-line spectroscopy, atomic emission multiline spectrosoopy, molecular rotation-vibration spectroscopy, coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and plane laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), were reviewed in this paper. The maximum time resolution of atomic absorption-emission method is 25 mus. The time resolution of atomic emission two-fine spectroscopy can reach 0.1 mus. These two methods can completely suit the need of real time and instantaneous temperature diagnostics of violent explosion and flame combustion. Other methods will also provide new effective research methods for the processes and characteristics of combustion, flame and explosin.

AB The combustion temperature is one of the important parameters to express flame combustion and explosion characteristics. It will effectively guide the design and manufacture of new model explosives, industrial explosive materials, and weapons. The recent developments and applications of real time diagnostics of instantaneous temperature of combustion and explosion processes by modem spectroscopic methods, such as atomic absorption-emission method, atomic emission two-line spectroscopy, atomic emission multiline spectrosoopy, molecular rotation-vibration spectroscopy, coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and plane laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), were reviewed in this paper. The maximum time resolution of atomic absorption-emission method is 25 mus. The time resolution of atomic emission two-fine spectroscopy can reach 0.1 mus. These two methods can completely suit the need of real time and instantaneous temperature diagnostics of violent explosion and flame combustion. Other methods will also provide new effective research methods for the processes and characteristics of combustion, flame and explosin.

AB [1] We present a statistical analysis of the salient characteristics of the electric and magnetic fields and their derivatives at distances of 15 m and 30 m from triggered lightning strokes that lowered negative charge to ground. Return stroke current and current derivative characteristics are also presented. The measurements were made during the summers of 1999 and 2000 at Camp Blanding, Florida. Lightning was triggered to a 1 to 2 m strike object at the center of a 70 m x 70 m metal-grid ground plane that was buried beneath a few centimeters of soil. The strike object was mounted on the rocket launching system that was located below ground level in a pit. The experiment was designed (1) to minimize the influence of the strike object on the field and field derivative waveforms an (2) to eliminate potential distortions of the field and field derivative waveforms both due to ground surface arcing and due to the propagation of the field being over imperfectly conducting ground. Measurements were made on about 100 return strokes, although not all field quantities were successfully recorded for each stroke. We present histograms and parameters of statistical distributions for the following 28 waveform characteristics: current peak, risetime, and width; current derivative peak, risetime, and width; return-stroke electric field change and field pulse width at 15 m and at 30 m; electric field derivative peak, risetime, and width at 15 m and at 30 m; magnetic field peak, risetime, and width at 15 m and at 30 m; and magnetic field derivative peak, risetime, and width at 15 m and at 30 m. We compare our results with those from previous studies. From this comparison we infer, among other results, that for strikes to our buried metal-grid ground plane the current risetime and width are, on average, smaller than for strikes to concentrated grounding electrodes (vertical ground rods).

AB A coronal funnel model, developed by D. Rabin, was tested against a calibrated spectroheliogram recorded in the 170-175 Angstrom bandpass. This image was recorded on board a sounding-rocket experiment own on 1994 November 3, called the Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array II (MSSTA II). MSSTA, a joint project of Stanford University, the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is an observing platform composed of a set of normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics designed to obtain narrow-bandpass, high-resolution images (1"-3") at selected far-ultraviolet (FUV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), and soft X-ray wavelengths (44-1550 Angstrom). Using full-disk images centered at 1550 Angstrom (C IV) and 173 Angstrom (Fe IX/X, the funnel model, which is based on coronal back-heating, was tested against the data incorporating observed constraints on global coverage and measured flux. Found was a class of funnel models that could account for the quiescent, globally diffuse and unresolved emission seen in the 171-175 Angstrom bandpass, where the funnels are assumed to be rooted in the C IV supergranular network. These models, when incorporated with the CHIANTI spectral code, suggest that this emission is mostly of upper transition region origin and primarily composed of Fe IX plasma. The funnels are found to have constrictions, Gamma similar to 6-20, which is in good agreement with the observations. Further, the fitted models simultaneously satisfy global areal constraints seen in both images; namely, that a global network of funnels must cover similar to70%-95% of the total solar surface area seen in the 171-175 Angstrom image, and less than or equal to45% of the disk area seen in the 1550 Angstrom bandpass. These findings support the configuration of the EUV magnetic network as suggested by Reeves et al. and put forth in more detail by Gabriel. Furthermore, the models are in good agreement with differential emission measure estimates made of the transition region by J. C. Raymond & J. G. Doyle for temperatures 250,000 K less than or equal to T less than or equal to 650,000 K, based on full-disk observations made on board Skylab.

AB On 11 February 1997 at 08:36 UT after a substorm onset the Auroral Turbulence 2 sounding rocket was launched from Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska into a moderately active auroral region. This experiment has allowed us to investigate evening (21:00 MLT) auroral forms at the substorm recovery, which were discrete multiple auroral arcs stretched to, the east and southeast from the breakup region, and bright auroral patches propagating westward along the arcs like a luminosity wave, which is a typical feature of the disturbed arc. The rocket crossed an auroral arc of about 40 km width, stretched along southeast direction. Auroral patches and associated electric fields formed a 200 km long periodical structure, which propagated along the arc westward at a velocity of 3 km/s, whereas the ionospheric plasma velocity inside the arc was 300 m/s westward. The spatial periodicity in the rocket data was found from optical ground-based observations, from electric field in situ measurements, as well as from ground-based magnetic observations. The bright patches were co-located with equatorward plasma flow across the arc of the order of 200 m/s in magnitude, whereas the plasma flow tended to be poleward at the intervals between the patches, where the electric field reached the magnitude of up to 20 mV/m, and these maxima were co-located with the peaks in electron precipitations indicated by the electron counter on board the rocket. Pulsations of a 70-s period were observed on the ground in the eastern component of the magnetic field and this is consistent with the moving auroral patches and the north-south plasma flows associated with them. The enhanced patch-associated electric field and fast westward propagation suggest essential differences between evening auroral patches and those occurring in the morning ionosphere. We propose the wave that propagates along the plasma sheet boundary to be a promising mechanism for the evening auroral patches.

AB This paper describes how the design of a scientific satellite can be used to provide both a stimulating and effective subject for a physics based group study. The group study divides the satellite into distinct subsystems and small teams of two or three students carry out the detailed design of each subsystem. The aim is to produce a complete satellite system design along with the choice of launch vehicle, orbit and communications system so that all the mission requirements can be met. An important feature of the group study is that it is a student led activity with staff acting as mentors. The development of key skills and important learning outcomes from the group study is discussed along with the method for assessment, structuring and resourcing the study.

AB Ammonium perchlorate is used as an oxidizer in rocket fuel. It has become a groundwater contaminant, dissociating to ammonium cation and perchlorate anion. The perchlorate ion competes with iodide for uptake into the thyroid, reducing thyroid hormone production. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given either untreated or perchlorate (1 mg/kg-day) treated drinking water beginning on gestation day 2. One set of control and exposed dams was sacrificed on gestation day 20. The litters from the second set of control and exposed dams were crossed immediately after parturition and were sacrificed at postnatal day 10. Dam serum and thyroid, pooled fetal sera, and male and female pup sera were collected and analyzed for perchlorate, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T-3), and thyroxine (T-4). Control pups receiving perchlorate through lactation had serum levels at postnatal day 10 of 0.54 mug/ml and 0.56 mug/ml for male and female pups, respectively, whereas exposed fetuses had serum perchlorate levels of 0.38 +/- 0.04 mug/ml. Female pups receiving perchlorate lactationally had significantly lower levels of serum T-4 than control pups and prenatally exposed pups. Serum T-4 levels in male pups were not affected by perchlorate. Serum thyroid hormone levels from gestational perchlorate exposure were restored to control values by postnatal day 10. In utero perchlorate-exposure decreased serum T-4 levels in the fetus. Gestational studies in conjunction with a cross-fostering study design helped discern thyroid hormonal changes caused by perchlorate exposure during the perinatal period.

DE reusable launchers; SABRE; SKYLON; SSTO
AB This paper discusses the relevant selection criteria for a single stage to orbit (SSTO) propulsion system and then reviews the characteristics of the typical engine types proposed for this role against these criteria. The engine types considered include Hydrogen/Oxygen (H-2/O-2) rockets, Scramjets, Turbojets, Turborockets and Liquid Air Cycle Engines. In the authors opinion none of the above engines are able to meet all the necessary criteria for an SSTO propulsion system simultaneously. However by selecting appropriate features from each it is possible to synthesise a new class of engines which are specifically optimised for the SSTO role. The resulting engines employ precooling of the airstream and a high internal pressure ratio to enable a relatively conventional high pressure rocket combustion chamber to be utilised in both airbreathing and rocket modes. This results in a significant mass saving with installation advantages which by careful design of the cycle thermodynamics enables the full potential of airbreathing to be realised. The SABRE engine which powers the SKYLON launch vehicle is an example of one of these so called 'Precooled hybrid airbreathing rocket engines' and the conceptual reasoning which leads to its main design parameters are described in the paper.

AB Optimizations of stiffened shells with different stiffener shapes performed to rank and identify the optimum designs during the preliminary design trade studies require a large number of analyses and hence rely on the use of efficient but approximate analysis methods. In the design of shells, the treatment of imperfections on buckling loads and stresses is of paramount importance. It is demonstrated how conservativeness of the approximate analyses used in buckling load calculation, the number of variables optimized (design freedom), and nonstructural constraints influence the "eight of optimum designs. This demonstration is based on the results of a trade study performed to compare minimum weight designs of stiffened shells optimized under stress and buckling constraints for a reusable launch vehicle tank. PANDA2 was selected for the present study because it uses approximate analysis procedures that permit the many thousands of structural analyses needed for global optimization and it also has sophisticated machinery for generating imperfections and accounting for their effects. Optimum weights were influenced not only by material choice, number of optimization variables, and manufacturing constraints, but also by the analysis model conservativeness. Optimization of shells with effect of initial imperfections exhibited substantial weight differences between different stiffened-shell concepts, partly because of conservativeness in the analysis.

AB A variety of reusable launch vehicle concepts has been designed and analyzed within the scope of the Future European Space Transportation Investigations Program systems study, which has been performed under a contract of the ESA by a joint European industry team. The designs under consideration included reusable two-stage-to-orbit configurations as well as several reusable single-stage-to-orbit vehicles with cryogenic rocket propulsion. All concepts were based on unified requirements, standards, technology assumptions, and design tools. To verify the consistency of the design process and to ensure the compatibility of the achieved results, as well as to identify. the relative merits and inherent characteristics of the different basic vehicle concepts, a comparative technical assessment was performed among the various designs themselves as well as in relation to analogous configurations from other programs found in the open literature. Whereas the performance relations between the designs generated under common ground rules were found to be plausible, discrepancies in comparison to other programs could be traced to differences in requirements, technology assumptions, and design approaches. The results of associated considerations with respect to the main vehicle characteristics and related performance parameters are presented.

AB [1] The goal of this study is to quantify uptake of H2O and HNO3 by and estimate their residence time on alumina particles in Athena-2 rocket plumes. This study uses in situ measurements made in the lower stratosphere with the NASA WB-57F high-altitude aircraft on 24 September 1999. Constraining the Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. (AER), plume model with available measurements, we found that (1) H2O uptake coefficient for alumina particles is larger than 3 x 10(-4), (2) HNO3 is produced via ClONO2 + HCl --> Cl-2 + HNO3 on alumina particles and resides on their surfaces for 5-52 min, and (3) alumina particles in the plume are covered by 100-200 monolayers of adsorbed H2O and 0.1 - 10 monolayers of HNO3 under lower stratospheric conditions. These values are uncertain by at least a factor of 2. We speculate that the H2O coverage remaining on alumina particles accelerates the ClONO2 + HCl --> Cl-2 + HNO3 reaction, thus leading to a larger than previously thought global ozone loss to solid-fueled rocket emissions, especially if at least several percent of emitted alumina mass are in submicron particles.

AB Accurate measurement of semen exposure resulting from condom failures can refine public health messages and improve predictions of condom efficacy in preventing pregnancy and HIV transmission. Eight hundred and thirty couples enrolled in a condom efficacy study were asked to collect a baseline sample of ejaculate from the inside of the first study condom they used and to collect a postcoital vaginal sample whenever a study condom broke or slipped off during intercourse. All samples were quantitatively tested for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a substance found only in human semen, using rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and inspected microscopically for presence of sperm. Sixty-eight baseline ejaculate samples collected from the inside of the first study condom by couples who subsequently experienced a condom failure averaged 13.4 mug PSA per swab and 79% of the samples averaged one or more sperm per high power field (hpf). Seventy-nine postcoital vaginal samples obtained after a condom break averaged 5.7 mug PSA per swab and only 38% averaged one or more sperm per hpf. The PSA results indicated a 50% reduction in semen exposure compared to baseline levels (p = 0.0001). Seventeen samples obtained after a condom slip-off averaged 2.5 mug PSA per swab and none of the samples averaged one or more sperm per hpf. The PSA results indicated an 80% reduction in semen exposure compared to baseline levels (p = 0.0001). Our results suggest that even condoms that fail reduce the risk of pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted disease compared to unprotected intercourse. We also used PSA results to adjust a model designed to predict consistent-use pregnancy rates from condom breakage and slippage data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most significant problems in the processing of composite materials is residual stress. The high residual stress may cause cracking in the matrix without external loads and degrade the integrity of composite structures. In this study, thermo-viscoelastic residual stresses occurred in an aluminum liner-inserted polymer composite cylinder are investigated. This type of the structure is used for rocket fuselage due to the convenience to attach payloads and equipment to the metal liner by machining. The time and degree of cure dependent thermoviscoelastic constitutive equations are developed and coupled with a thermo-chemical process model. These equations are solved with the finite element method to predict the residual stresses in the composite cylinder and also in the interface between the liner and the composite during cure.

   distribution in a model for a solid propellant rocket grain
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Mueller matrices; photoelasticity; stress analysis; solid propellant;
   rocket grain; isochromatic fringes
AB We introduce some basic optical rules dealing with Mueller matrices as phenomenological descriptors of optical devices. Specific simple examples illustrate how all the Stokes parameters of a beam passing through a system of several devices can be determined by the multiplication of the individual Mueller matrices of the respective system components and the Stokes vector of the incident beam. Two resulting families of interference fringes in the (visible) emerging field of the devices considered are separated from each other by the introduction of suitable additional system components. The "isochromatic" family of fringes can thus be isolated from the "isoclinic" family, and a natural application to photoelastic problems becomes evident. Thus, a second purpose is to use this technique and these fringes to photoelastically determine the stress distribution in a disk with a square perforation, when the disk is subjected to a uniformly distributed pressure, acting at its outside or at its inside periphery. This enables the visualization and quantification of the stresses developed during the burning of the grain. The size of the square hole and the radii of the fillets at the corners of the square are variables of the study. Results are given as stress concentration factors, in dimensionless form, and are of use to the designer of solid propellant rocket grains. An analogy is given to suggest another application at longer wavelengths to calibrate or discriminate between some radar signals in the microwave region.

AB Using a Nal(TI) scintillation detector designed to operate in electrically noisy environments, we observed intense bursts of energetic radiation (>>10 kilo-electron volts) during the dart leader phase of rocket-triggered lightning, just before and possibly at the very start of 31 out of the 37 return strokes measured. The bursts had typical durations of less than 100 microseconds and deposited many tens of megaelectron volts into the detector. These results provide strong evidence that the production of runaway electrons is an important process during lightning.

AB Two decades of research in microgravity have shown that certain biochemical processes can be altered by weightlessness. Approximately 10 years ago. our team, supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana. started the Effect of Microgravity on Enzyme Catalysis project to test the possibility that the microgravity effect observed at cellular level could be mediated by enzyme reactions. An experiment to study the cleavage reaction catalyzed by isocitrate lyase was flown on the sounding rocket MASER 7, and we found that the kinetic parameters were not altered by microgravity. During the 28th ESA parabolic flight campaign, we had the opportunity to replicate the MASER 7 experiment and to perform a complete steady-state analysis of the isocitrate lyase reaction. This study showed that both in microgravity and in standard g controls the enzyme reaction obeyed the same kinetic mechanism and none of the kinetic parameters. nor the equilibrium constant of the overall reaction were altered. Our results contrast with those of a similar experiment, which was performed during the same parabolic flight campaign, and showed that microgravity increased the affinity of lipoxygenase-1 for linoleic acid. The hypotheses suggested to explain this change effect of the latter were here tested by computer simulation, and appeared to be inconsistent with the experimental outcome.

AB It is now feasible to construct highly capable 'nanosatellites' (i.e. sub-10 kg satellites) to provide cost-effective and rapid-response orbiting test vehicles for advanced space missions and technologies. The UK's first nanosatellite, SNAP-1-designed and built by Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) staff-is an example of such a test vehicle: in this case, built with the primary objective of demonstrating that a sophisticated, fully agile nanosatellite can be constructed rapidly, and at very low cost, using an extension of the modular-COTS-based design philosophy pioneered by SSC for its microsatellites.
   SNAP-1 was successfully launched into orbit on 28 June 2000 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome on board a Russian Cosmos rocket. It flew alongside a Russian Cospas-Sarsat satellite called Nadezhda, and an SSTL-built Chinese microsatellite, called Tsinghua-1.
   The first year of operations has been highly successful, with SNAP-1 becoming the first nanosatellite to have demonstrated full attitude and orbit control, via its miniature momentum-wheel-based attitude control system and its butane-propellant-based propulsion system. This paper reviews the initial results of the SNAP-1 mission.

AB Among a wide variety of challenging projects planned for the coming decade is the MUSES-C mission designed by the ISAS of Japan. Despite huge amount of data collected by the previous interplanetary spacecraft and probes, the origin and evolution of the solar system still remains unveiled due to their limited information. Thus, our concern has been directed toward a sample return to carry sample from an asteroid back to the earth, which will contribute to better understanding of the system. One of the keys to success is considered the reentry technology with hyperbolic velocity, which has not been demonstrated yet. With this as background, the demonstrator of atmospheric reentry system with hyperbolic velocity, DASH, has been given a commitment to demonstrate the high-speed reentry technology, which will be launched in summer of next year by Japan's H-IIA rocket in a piggyback configuration. The spaceship, composed of a reentry capsule and its carrier, will be injected into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) and after several revolutions it will deorbit by burn of a solid propellant deorbit motor. The capsule, identical to that of the sample return mission, can experience the targeted level of thermal environment even from the GTO by tracing a specially designed reentry trajectory.

AB Aladdin, one of five Concept Study winners for NASA's Discovery A098-OSS-04, was a mission to obtain samples from the two Martian moons using several unique mission design and sample collection techniques. The mission design enabled sample return from two bodies at the relatively low cost of a Discovery-class mission. It featured a phasing orbit, multiple flybys of the Martian moons, and a short overall mission duration. The phasing orbit greatly reduced the post-launch Deltav requirement, thus permitting the use of a Delta II launch vehicle. Multiple moon flybys provided ample opportunities for sample collection and science observations. The short overall mission duration reduced program costs. Aladdin's sample collection, unlike traditional sample collection methods, used a "launch-and-catch" technique to obtain samples. Projectiles would be launched to the moon's surface during a close flyby and the ejected particles gathered for Earth return and analysis. This innovative technique, the Aladdin mission, and the possible extension of the technique to other bodies are described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a near-term implementation solution to the exploration of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. We first start by providing the scientific rationale for a mission to Io, and its alignment within NASA's strategic plan. The instruments selected represent a careful balance between focused scientific goals, and programmatic restrictions imposed by a Discovery-class mission. We discuss the difficulties inherent in visiting distant Io, including those to be expected from its extreme radiation environment. The mission design incorporates a trajectory in line with overall cost constraints, including launch vehicle limitations. Finally, the spacecraft design incorporates the use of solar arrays and chemical propulsion as a demonstration of the feasibility of executing an outer planet mission with state-of-the-art technology. In summary, we present the scientific rationale and demonstrate both the feasibility and limitations of a Discovery-class mission to Io, relying exclusively on existing or near-term developing technologies.

AB EUROCKOT Launch Services GmbH was founded by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany and Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center of Russia to offer worldwide cost-effective launch services on the flight proven and reliable Rockot launch system. Rockot can launch satellites weighting up to 1850 kg into low earth orbits (LEO) from around 50degrees up to high inclinations (e.g. SSO).
   The paper describes the design, the capabilities and the user interfaces of the Rockot launch vehicle which is based on the former Russian SS-19 strategic missile. The third stage "Breeze" has been newly developed and has multiple ignition capability. The extremely high flexibility of both the payload accommodation and the launch systems allows fast service, i.e. a mission integration period of 18 months from contract signature and a nominal launch campaign which lasts 19 working days.
   The launch site in Plesetsk has been modernised and adapted to fulfil all requirements of Western customers. The modifications will be verified by a launch of two satellite simulators in the second quarter of 2000. The first commercial launch (two IRIDIUM satellites) is foreseen for the third quarter of 2000.
   EUROCKOT is also in a position to offer high altitude orbits. In particular for payloads with a mass of up to approximately 320 kg even earth escape/planetary mission with reliable competitive and flight qualified systems can be offered by adding a solid boost stage to the Rockot launcher in co-operation with the major provider of these stages. In this paper the performance envelope, interfaces and potential design solutions will be discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A key feature of future deep-space science missions will be the need for significantly greater on-board propulsion capability. To meet this need, ion propulsion based on the technology that flew on NASA's Deep Space I spacecraft has now entered the mainstream of propulsion options available for deep-space missions. The next most likely science mission to use ion propulsion is the comet nucleus sample return (CNSR) mission. CNSR has recently been identified by the Solar System Exploration Subcommittee as the highest priority new mission for NASA's Exploration of the Solar System theme. Ion propulsion for CNSR enables the use of a smaller, less expensive launch vehicle, and significantly shortens the overall trip time. A trade study for CNSR was performed to identify engine and system technology improvements, which provide the greatest mission benefits for the lowest additional risk. This trade study indicated that the maximum specific impulse of the ion engine should be increased from 3100 to 3800 s and that the maximum engine input power should be increased from 2.3 to 3.2 M Simultaneously the engine total propellant throughput capability must be increased from the 80-kg NSTAR design point to approximately 180 kg. A focused technology program to make these advances is underway. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Small hybrid rocket motors using solid propellant and gaseous oxidizer are becoming increasingly popular as a propulsion device. This paper describes the development of a one-dimensional flow model for the design of a small rocket motor. Combustion of polyethylene as solid propellant with oxygen is used as a candidate hybrid fuel to test and evaluate the performance of this hybrid system. To assess the performance under different operating conditions, a computer program has been developed, which facilitates inputs to be varied and effects assessed. A system of governing equations is summarized in the main body of this paper and is numerically solved by the computer program. The results of the modelling are then used to design and build a small low-cost rocket motor for experimental verification. Therefore, the materials presented herein could be used in the future design of hybrid rocket motors.

AB This paper introduces a robust computational technique named the network simulation method (NSM) that is exemplary for the numerical prediction of spatio-temporal temperatures in multi-layered composite walls in regular coordinate systems. The problem that was analyzed here deals with a composite nozzle wall of an experimental rocket engine that is fabricated with two dissimilar materials: a metallic substrate and a ceramic coating. The model involving two coupled, unidirectional nonlinear heat conduction equations in a two-material wall (ceramic coating and metallic substrate) and a convective-radiative boundary condition has been solved numerically with the NSM. NSM has its genesis in the resistance-capacitance analogy that exists between unsteady, unidirectional conduction of heat and unsteady flow of electric current. The network-simulated estimates for the temperature-time history inside the composite nozzle were performed with the code PSPICE easily, quickly, and accurately. The rapid temperature raise of the ceramic coating/metallic substrate interface from room temperature is the determining factor in this study. The time lapse to reach the melting temperature of the metallic substrate dictates the approximate duration of the ground firing test and evidently constitutes ihe primary design constraint.

AB One of the strongest solar proton events (SPE) occurred in October 1989. The ionized layer in the atmosphere is a result of interaction between radiation (electromagnetic and particle) and the neutral atmosphere. Changes of the neutral and ionized composition due to this event are examined. The ionization rate, and ozone, NO and OH density temporal and spatial (vertical) deviations induced by the SPE, calculated by a I-D time dependent photochemical model separately for daytime and nighttime are used in a I-D model of the lower ionosphere to calculate the response of ionized components and other parameters of the lower ionosphere. The results of model calculations are compared with the empirical model of high-latitude electron densities, with rocket measurements of O-3 and n(+) from Russian research vessel, with parameter f(+) obtained for November 1969 SPE and with experimental a(eff) data for disturbed conditions.

AB In order to increase the flight range of aerospace vehicles and the efficiency of solid rocket motors, designers attempt to reduce the weight of solid rocket motors. A skirt is a potential element for weight reduction in rocket motors as it leads to reduction of the total weight of solid rocket motor. Due to its significance for solid rocket motors, the objective of this paper is to investigate the optimal design of a fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt subjected to a buckling strength constraint and an overstressing strength constraint under aerodynamic torque and axial thrust. The present optimal design problem involve in determining the best laminate configuration to minimize the weight of the cylindrical skirt. To find the optimal solution accurately and quickly, the hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is employed in this work. Buckling strength and overstressing strength of the fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt are analyzed using classical laminate theory and elastic stability theory of thin shells. The Tsai-Wu failure criterion is employed to assess the first ply failure, and an overstressing load level factor is introduced to describe the failure strength. In addition, a buckling load factor is introduced to describe the buckling strength. Due to the critical issue of buckling strength, the effects of the design parameters on the buckling strength are investigated in this work. Finally, a practical design example of the proposed fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt is investigated using the present analysis procedure. Results reveal that the fiber-reinforced composite cylindrical skirt laminated symmetrically with both cross-ply layers [0/90degrees] and angle-ply layers [+45/-45degrees] can sustain a great buckling load. Furthermore, the buckling strength of the skirt shell laminated with equal-hybrid between the angle-ply layers and the cross-ply layers is greater than that of the skirt shell laminated with over-weighted hybrid between the angle-ply layers and the cross-ply layers. Results provide a valuable reference for designers of aerospace vehicles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LABORATORY SIMULATION; MAGNETOSPHERE; SPACE
AB The active geophysical rocket experiment "North Star" was carried out in the auroral ionosphere on January 22, 1999, at the Poker Flat Research Range (Alaska, USA) using the American research rocket Black Brant XII with explosive plasma generators on board. Separable modules with scientific equipment were located at distances of from 170 to 1595 m from the plasma source. The experiment continued the series of the Russian-American joint experiments started by the "Fluxus" experiment in 1997. Two injections of aluminum plasma across the magnetic field were conducted in the "North Star" experiment. They were different, since in the first injection a neutral gas cloud was formed in order to increase the plasma ionization due to the interaction of neutrals of the jet and cloud. The first and second injections were conducted at heights of 360 and 280 km, respectively. The measurements have shown that the charged particle density was two orders of magnitude higher in the experiment with the gas release. The magnetic field in the first injection was completely expelled by the dense plasma of the jet. The displacement of the magnetic field in the second injection was negligible. The plasma jet velocity in both injections decreased gradually due to its interaction with the geomagnetic field. One of the most interesting results of the experiment was the conservation of high plasma density during the propagation of the divergent jet to considerable distances. This fact can be explained by the action of the critical ionization velocity mechanism.

AB This paper considers the problem of robust H, output feedback controller design for linear uncertain distributed delay systems with time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty in both the state and measurement equations. The problem the address is the design of a full-order output feedback controller which stabilizes the given system and guarantees a prescribed H-infinity-norm bound constraint on disturbance attenuation for all admissible uncertainties. A sufficient condition for the solvability of this problem is obtained in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, an expression of desired output feedback controllers is also given. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the robust stabilization and control of combustion in the chamber of a liquid monopropellant rocket motor.

AB The development of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) was initiated in the late 1970s to address a critical requirement for fast, high-power interplanetary space transportation. While not being a fusion rocket, it nevertheless borrows heavily from that technology and takes advantage of the natural topology of open-ended magnetic systems. In addition to its high power density and high exhaust velocity, VASIMR is capable of "constant power throttling" a feature, which allows in-flight mission-optimization of thrust and specific impulse to enhance performance and reduce trip time. A NASA-led, research team, involving industry, academia and government facilities is pursuing the development of this concept in the United States. The technology can be validated, in the near term, in venues such as the International Space Station, where it can also serve as both a drag compensation device and a plasma contactor for the orbital facility. Other near-Earth applications in the commercial and scientific satellite sectors are also envisioned. This presentation covers the evolution of the VASIMR concept to its present status, as well as recent accomplishments in our understanding of the physics. Approaches and collaborative programs addressing the major technical challenges will also be presented.

AB The Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL) of NASA's Johnson Space Center is performing research on a Variable Specific Impulse MagnetoPlasma Rocket (VASIMR). The VASIMR is a high power, radio frequency (RF) driven magnetoplasma rocket, capable of very high exhaust velocities, > 100 km/s. A NASA-led research team involving industry, academia and government facilities is pursuing the development of this concept in the United States. The ASPL's experimental research focuses on three major areas: helicon plasma production, ion cyclotron resonant frequency (ICRF) acceleration and plasma expansion in a magnetic nozzle. The VASIMR experiment (VX-10) performs experimental research that demonstrates the thruster concept at a total RF power on the order of 10 W A flexible four-magnet system, with a 1.3 Tesla maximum magnetic field strength, allows axial magnetic field profile shape effects to be studied. Power generated at 10-50 MHz with about 3 kW is used to perform helicon plasma source development. A 3 MHz RF transmitter capable of 100 kW is available for ICRF experiments. The primary diagnostics are: gas mass flow controllers, RF input power, Langmuir probes, Mach probe, retarding potential analyzers (RPA), microwave interferometer, neutral pressure measurements and plasma light emission. In addition, many thermocouples are attached inside the vacuum chamber to measure heat loads around the plasma discharge.
   Helicon research has been done with hydrogen, deuterium, helium, nitrogen, argon, xenon and mixtures of these gases. Optimization studies have been performed with the magnetic field axial profile shape, antenna geometry, gas flow rate, gas tube geometry and RF frequency. ICRF experiments have begun, primarily using a high density (> 10(18)/m(3)) helium helicon discharge as a target. Over 6 kW of power has been applied using a simple antenna array. The latest results of helicon and ICRF experiments will be presented.

AB The ability to obtain high plasma densities with high fractional ionization using readily available, low-cost components makes the helicon a candidate plasma source for many applications, including plasma rocket propulsion, fusion component testing, and materials processing. However, operation of a helicon can be a sensitive function of the magnetic field strength and geometry as well as the driving frequency, especially when using light feedstock gases such as hydrogen or helium. In this paper we compare results from a coupled radio frequency (RF) and transport model with experiments in the axially inhomogeneous Mini-Radio Frequency Test Facility (Mini-RFTF). Experimental observations of the radial shape of the density profile can be quantitatively reproduced by iteratively converging a high-resolution RF calculation including the RF parallel electric field with a transport model using reasonable choices for the transport parameters. The experimentally observed transition into the high density helicon mode is observed in the model, appearing as a nonlinear synergism between radial diffusion, the RF coupling to parallel electric fields that damp near the plasma edge, and propagation of helicon waves that collisionally damp near the axis of the device. Power deposition from various electric field components indicates that inductive coupling and absorption in the edge region can reduce the efficiency for high-density operation. These findings can be used to optimize helicon discharges for use in Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) designs, and estimates for the helicon power required to perform ion cyclotron heating experiments in the Mini-RFTF are given.

AB The technique of particle correlation measures directly electron modulations that result from naturally occurring and actively stimulated wave-particle interactions in space plasmas. In the past this technique has been used for studies of beam-plasma interactions, caused by both natural auroral electron beams via sounding rockets and by artificially generated electron beams on Space Shuttle missions (STS-46, STS-75). It has also been applied to studies of how electrons become energised by waves injected from in-situ transmitters (e.g OEDIPUS-C sounding rocket). All four ESA Cluster-H spacecraft launched in 2000 to study the outer magnetosphere, cusp, and bow shock were implemented with electron correlators. Here the prevalent weaker wave-particle interactions have been more difficult to extract, however, the application of new statistical algorithms has permitted these correlators to provide a novel insight into the plasma turbulence that occurs. Present work involves technical improvements to both sensor design and correlator implementation that enable many electron energy-angle combinations to be simultaneously monitored for wave-particle interactions. A broad energy-angle range spectrograph connected to a multi-channel, multi-frequency range FPGA implemented array of correlators. is scheduled to fly early 2004. Neural network techniques previously flown on STS-46 and STS-75, and statistical tests developed for Cluster-H will be used on-board to select data to be transmitted. (C) 2003 COSPAR.

AB Finless rockets are more efficient than finned designs, but are too unstable to fly unassisted. These rockets require an active guidance system to control their orientation, during flight and maintain stability. Because rocket dynamics are highly non-linear, developing such a guidance system can be prohibitively costly, especially for relatively small-scale rockets such as sounding rockets. In this paper, we propose a method for evolving a neural network guidance system using the Enforced SubPopulations (ESP) algorithm. Based on a detailed simulation model, a controller is evolved for a finless version of the Interorbital Systems RSX-2 sounding rocket. The resulting performance is compared to that of an unguided standard full-finned version. Our results show that the evolved active guidance controller can greatly increase the final altitude of the rocket, and that ESP can be an effective method for solving real-world, non-linear control tasks.

AB A small satellite is likely to tumble as the result of separating from the rocket. It is therefore very important to capture it promptly with finite magnetic torque. Magnetic torque is orthogonal to the external magnetic field; therefore, it is impossible to generate precisely the control torque that would be required according to simple control theories. However, it is possible to define the desirable torque first and then derive from this the actual control torque. A criteria is presented for this derivation and two control algorithms are formulated, based on nonlinear design theories. One is the energy method that takes the Lyapunov function as a control criteria and uses a divided districts control algorithm to determine the desirable torque. The other one uses the variable structure control method to define the desirable torque. The results of computer simulation indicated that these algorithms have the advantages of excellent robustness and are easily designed and realized.

AB A research algorithm is developed to retrieve temperature at 20-90 km using 63 GHz O-2 emission measurements from Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The algorithm is based on a previous MLS radiative transfer model but improved to produce more accurate radiance calculations in the cases where the geomagnetic Zeeman splitting is important. A fast version of the model is developed and implemented for practical uses of the temperature retrieval, which uses a single temperature and O-2 density profile as the linearization basis. The calculated radiances and linearization coefficients are fit to a set of explicit functions of the geomagnetic field and its direction at tangent heights of 0-120 km, which are pre-stored in order to speed up the computation. The new algorithm has been used to process all the data available during 1991-1997 before MLS 63 GHz radiometer was powered off. The estimated precision of MLS temperature varies from 2 K at similar to20 km to 8 K at similar to80 km and increases sharply above similar to90 km. The retrieved MLS temperature are compared against CIRA'86, satellite, lidar, and rocket observations. Comparisons to CIRA'86 seasonal climatology show that the differences are latitude-and-season dependent and generally < 5 K below 50 km and 10 K in the mesosphere. Comparisons with other satellite observations (ISAMS, HRDI, CRISTA1) show different patterns but a cold bias at 85-90 km seems common in all these comparisons. Comparisons to ground-based lidar measurements suggest that MLS temperatures are warmer by 2-4 K in the stratosphere and colder by 5-15 K at 85-90 km. The MLS-minus-lidar difference shows a 3-10 K cold bias near 70 km for most of the sites selected. The comparisons with rocket measurements are similar to those with lidars at these altitudes, giving cold biases in the MLS temperatures at 85-90 km. Most of these biases are understandable in terms of sampling and resolution differences, and some biases can be reduced with further improvements in the MLS retrieval algorithm. Despite the existing biases, the MLS temperature have been found useful in studying large-scale mesospheric phenomena such as the temperature inversion layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID GUIDANCE
AB A methodology for very fast design of three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) entry trajectories subject to all common inequality and equality constraints is developed. The approach makes novel use of the quasi-equilibrium glide phenomenon in lifting entry as a centerpiece for effective and efficient enforcement of the inequality constraints. The highly constrained nonlinear trajectory planning problem is decomposed into two sequential one-parameter search problems. The algorithm is able to generate a complete and feasible 3DOF entry trajectory of 25-min flight time in about 2-3 s on a desktop computer, given the entry conditions, values of constraint parameters, and final conditions. High-fidelity numerical simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various entry missions and trajectory planning using the space shuttle model are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the algorithm.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Aspects relating to the aerodynamic and propulsive design and analysis of missile-class, waverider-based hypersonic vehicles are explored in this paper. A quasi-one-dimensional engine model, including the effects of fuel injection, mixing, chemical production rates, heat transfer, and viscous losses, is developed and utilized to assess the effects of finite rate, hydrocarbon chemistry on optimized missile configurations. Resultant optimized single-and double-engine missile designs are shown for changes in fuel mixing length, fuel mixing efficiency, fuel-injector location, and assumed fuel mass fraction. The effects of these different design conditions on the cruise range are explored, as well as perturbations around these design points for optimized vehicles. Missiles are optimized for steady-state trim conditions at the beginning of cruise flight using parallelized genetic algorithm optimization software developed for this study. All missile designs are assumed to reach cruising altitude and velocity through the use of an external rocket booster. The missile is geometrically constrained to fit within the 0.61 x 0.61 x 4.27 m box limits for a naval vertical launch tube and has a desired cruise range of 750 km at Mach 8. Results show that the optimized combustor designs were extremely sensitive to small design perturbations. Two engine configurations are shown to be more robust than single-engine models for engine design perturbations.

DE decomposition; energetic materials; kinetics; lifetime; TG/DTA
AB At TNO Prins Maurits Laboratory the characterisation and application of energetic materials is one of the main research topics. In this respect, the activities are focussed on using thermal analysis techniques such as TG/DTA and DSC. Standard DSC and TG/DTA techniques usually apply a linear temperature increase. During this gradual temperature change, the sample may pass certain phase changes related to different crystal structures, followed by a melting/decomposition of the material. In this way physicochemical properties like phase change temperatures, melting point, enthalpy of melting, decomposition temperature, etc. can be determined. By applying different heating rates, an analysis of the decomposition kinetics can be performed as well, which gives additional information on the decomposition process of the material. In this way the activation energy of the decomposition process and the 'shelf-life' of the material, when stored at a certain temperature, can be assessed.
   In a co-operation with the Technical University of Aachen, two relatively new and promising energetic materials were investigated: FOX-7 and HNF. FOX-7, or 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene, is a less sensitive explosive, which could find application as a substitute of RDX (less sensitive but with preservation of performance).
   Hydrazinium nitroformate (HNF) is an oxidiser with potential use as a high-performance, chlorine-free ingredient in rocket propellants.
   The results of the TG/DTA and DSC tests, as well as the results of the analysis of the decomposition kinetics of these two materials, will be reported and discussed in this paper.

AB On December 7, 2001, the Jason-1 satellite was successfully launched by a Boeing Delta II rocket from the Vandenberg site in California, USA. Its main mission was to maintain the high accuracy altimeter measurements, provided since 1992 by TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), ensuring continuity in observing and monitoring the ocean for intraseasonal to interannual changes, mean sea level, tides, and so forth. Despite four times less mass and power, the Jason-1 system has been designed to have the same performances as T/P, measuring sea surface topography at the centimeter level. This new Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (CNES/NASA) mission also provides near real-time data for sea state and ocean forecast. The first 10 months of the Jason mission were dedicated to the verification of the system performance and cross-calibration with T/P measurements. A complete CALVAL plan was conducted by the Science and Project Teams of the mission based on in situ and regional experiments, global statistical approaches, and multisatellite comparisons, taking advantage of the T/P-Jason overlap during the first months of the mission. CALVAL and first science results showed that the Jason-1 performances were compliant with prelaunch specifications. This was a needed preamble before starting the routine phase of the mission in July 2003 with generation and distribution of validated geophysical data records to the whole user community.

AB On 7 December 2001, Jason-1 was successfully launched by a Boeing Delta II rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The Jason-1 satellite will maintain the high accuracy altimeter service provided since 1992 by TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), ensuring the continuity in observing and monitoring the Ocean Dynamics (intraseasonal to interannual changes, mean sea level, tides, etc.). Despite one-fourth the mass and power, the Jason-1 system has been designed to have basically the same performance as T/P, measuring sea surface topography at a centimetric level. This new CNES/NASA mission also provides near real-time data for sea state and ocean forecast. The first two months of the Jason-1 mission have been dedicated to the assessment of the overall system. The goals of this assessment phase were:
   1. To assess the behavior of the spacecraft at the platform and payload levels (Jason-1 being the first program to call on the PROTEUS versatile multimission platform for Low and Medium Earth Orbit Missions developed in partnership between Alcatel Space and CNES);
   2. To verify that platform performance requirements are met with respect to Jason-1 requirements;
   3. To verify that payload instruments performance requirements evaluated at instrument level are met;
   4. To assess the performance of the Jason-1 Ground System.
   This article will display the main outputs of the assessment of the system. It will demonstrate that all the elements of the onboard and ground systems are within the specifications. Provision of data to the Jason-1 Science Working Team started at the end of March 2002. This is the goal of a six-month phase after closure of the initial assessment phase to derive the error budget of the system in terms of altimetry user products.

AB The Small Explorer (SMEX) program of NASA was initiated during the late 1980s to provide frequent, cost-effective opportunities to carry out sharply focused and relatively inexpensive space science missions. The SMEX program together with the Mid-size Explorer (MIDEX) program were timely reactions to the increasingly long development times and cost over-runs for a number of large space missions during the previous decades. SMEX spacecrafts are typically 180 to 250 kg with orbit-averaged power consumptions of 50-200 watts. Frequently innovative or novel technologies and instrumentation are employed to achieve important results. The current cost cap (which includes cost of launch vehicle, development and operations) is $75M (Fiscal Year 2000 $US). For comparison, the cost cap of the MIDEX mission is $135M. Both SMEX and MIDEX are solicited Principal Investigator (PI) missions that are peer-reviewed before selection. The SMEX program is supported by the NASA's Office of Space Research (OSS) and a wide spectrum of science is addressed. The themes include Origin and Evolution of Stars and Planets, the Structure and Evolution of the Universe, and the Sun-Earth Connection. Within these major themes, the missions may also focus on fundamental laws of physics as they relate to astrophysics and cosmology. So far, seven SMEX missions have been flown or are approved for flight within one or two years. In this paper, the past, current, and possible future SMEX missions are discussed and evaluated. Some highlights and important scientific returns from the current and approved missions are also included. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

AB On July 15(th) 2000 the first MITA (Italian Advanced Technology Minisatellite) was launched from Plesetsk (Russia) by a Cosmos rocket as a piggy-back of the CHAMP satellite. The main purpose of the first MITA mission is its in-flight validation. Furthermore the scientific payload NINA-2 of INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare) and the technological payload MTS-AOMS (Micro Tech Sensor for Attitude and Orbit Measurement System) were embarked. The NINA-2 goal is the survey of galactic and solar cosmic rays at 450 km altitude. NITS is an ESA multi-tasking autonomous sensor based on Active Pixel Sensor (star and horizon sensor), Angular Rate Sensor and Magnetic Field Sensor. In this paper the main MITA bus characteristics are reported, together with the description of the launch and the first commissioning phase. The first mission nominal orbit is circular, with a 450 Km altitude and a 87degrees inclination. The satellite attitude is nadir pointing, 3 axes stabilised. Spacecraft mass is 169.9 Kg. Two fixed solar panels provide an average power of 85 W EOL. The configuration of the satellite main body is based on a cubic shape module, made of Aluminium beams and honeycomb panels. The Mission Control Center is placed in Rome, while the TT&C stations are in Cordoba (Argentina) and, only during the commissioning phase, in Malindi (Kenia); Malindi TT&C station will then be replaced by Fucino (Italy). Since the contacts between spacecraft and the TT&C stations do not occur every orbit, the satellite on board S/W was designed in order to reach the nominal mode without telecommand from ground.

AB Theoretical electron-density-sensitive emission line ratios involving 2s(2)2p(2)-2s2p(3) transitions in Si IX between 223 and 350 Angstrom are presented. A comparison of these with an extensive dataset of solar-active-region, quiet-Sun, subflare and off-limb observations, obtained during rocket flights by the Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS), reveals generally very good agreement between theory and experiment. This provides support for the accuracy of the line-ratio diagnostics, and hence the atomic data on which they are based. In particular, the density-sensitive intensity ratio I (258.10 Angstrom)/ I (349.87 Angstrom) offers an especially promising diagnostic for studies of coronal plasmas, as it involves two reasonably strong emission lines and varies by more than an order of magnitude over the useful density range of 10(9)-10(11) cm(-3). The 2s(2)2p(2) S-1(0) - 2s2p(3) P-1(1) transition at 259.77 Angstrom is very marginally identified for the first time in the SERTS database, although it has previously been detected in solar flare observations.

AB For systematic human Mars exploration, meeting crew safety requirements, it seems perspective to assemble into a spacecraft: an electrical rocket, a well-shielded long-term life support system, and a manipulator-robots operating in combined "presence effect" and "master-slave" mode. The electrical spacecraft would carry humans to the orbit of Mars, providing short distance (and low signal time delay) between operator and robot-manipulators, which are landed on the surface of the planet. Long-term hybrid biological and physical/chemical LSS could provide environment supporting human health and well being. Robot-manipulators operating in "presence effect" and "master-slave" mode exclude necessity of human landing on Martian surface decreasing the level of risk for crew. Since crewmen would not have direct contact with the Martian environment then the problem of mutual biological protection is essentially reduced. Lightweight robot-manipulators, without heavy life support systems and without the necessity of returning to the mother vessel, could be sent as scouts to different places on the planet surface, scanning the most interesting for exobiological research site. Some approximate estimations of electric spacecraft, long-term hybrid LSS, radiation protection and mission parameters are conducted and discussed. (C) 2002 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Estimation of transport opportunities of delivery of a research spacecraft (SC) to Mercury with the use of launcher "Proton", chemical upper stage (ChUS) as "D" and solar electric propulsion upper stage (SEPS) on the basis of thrusters ESA-XX and SPT is analyzed. It is assumed that Russian launch vehicle "Proton" and upper state "Block D" deliver a spacecraft into the geocentric hyperbolic orbit. Then "Block D" is separated. The heliocentric arc of the trajectory and operations in the vicinity of Mercury are supported by SEPS. It is supposed, that the change of SEPS thrust value according to available electrical power occurs due to change in propellant (Xenon) flow rate. The problem was formulated as follows. For the known characteristics of the ChUS, the SC and its systems are required to determine the unknown design SC parameters, circuit of transfer and control program of a thrust vector, ensuring delivery in the vicinity of Mercury of maximum SC mass at a given transfer duration. Chosen parameters and control functions are: mass of ChUS propellant (or value of hyperbolic excess velocity connected with it), direction of hyperbolic excess velocity, launch date, the control program of the thrust vector of the ion-engine (orientation of a thrust vector, moments of the engine firings and shut-down).

For the known characteristics of the ChUS, the SC and its systems are required to determine the unknown design SC parameters, circuit of transfer and control program of a thrust vector, ensuring delivery in the vicinity of Mercury of maximum SC mass at a given transfer duration. Chosen parameters and control functions are: mass of ChUS propellant (or value of hyperbolic excess velocity connected with it), direction of hyperbolic excess velocity, launch date, the control program of the thrust vector of the ion-engine (orientation of a thrust vector, moments of the engine firings and shut-down).

AB Aerothermal properties in a fuel spray is a central problem in the field of the design of the combustion chambers of automotive engines, turbojets or rocket engines. Heat and mass transfer models are necessary in the predictive calculation schemes used by the motorists. Reliable experimental data must be obtained for both the validation and development of new physical models linked to heat transfer and evaporation in sprays, where aerodynamic interactions have a key role. This paper proposes an experimental study of the energetic budget of a monodisperse ethanol droplet stream, injected in the thermal boundary layer of a vertical heated plate. The droplet size reduction is measured using a light scattering technique (interferential method) in order to characterize the evaporation, as the droplet mean temperature is monitored using the two colors laser-induced fluorescence technique. The convection heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number are inferred from the overall energetic budget, as a function of the inter-droplet distance, characterizing the interaction regime, The results are compared to physical models combined with numerical simulations available in the literature, for moving, evaporating isolated droplets and for three droplets arrangement in linear stream.

AB The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed an active proximity warning system called hazardous area signaling and ranging device (HASARD) for warning workers as they approach known dangerous areas around heavy mining equipment and other dangerous work zones. HASARD is composed of a transmitter and a receiver The transmitter generates a 60-kHz magnetic field using one or more wire loop antennas. Each antenna is adjusted to establish a magnetic field pattern for each hazardous area. The receiver, which is worn by the worker, is a magnetic field strength meter. The received signal. is compared against preset levels that are calibrated to identify levels of danger The receiver outputs can include visual, audible and vibratory indicators, and it can also be made to disable machine functions. HASARD was field tested on a Joy 12 continuous miner, a Komatsu 210 M Haulpak and on a highwall launch vehicle. Slight modifications were made for each application. HASARD provided warnings as designed, and it proved to be rugged enough to withstand the harshest of production environments.

AB Previous analyses of post-World War II developments of German rocket engines in Russia were mainly based on information published by Soviet scientists and design engineers in obscure specialist journals, which were the only sources giving the technical parameters of these engines. No detailed drawings and few photographs were published.
   A more accurate picture of the genesis of post-war Soviet rocket propulsion can now be painted. The author was granted unprecedented access to the archives of Moscow enterprises and research facilities. This material is supplemented by that from new Russian publications in the nineties and personal interviews with the German rocket experts who were taken to the USSR. For the first time it became clear that the raketnyje dvigateli (rocket engines) of even today's Soyuz launcher are based on the basic developments of German experts.

ID HYDROGEN; INJECTION
AB Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) was applied for temperature measurements in a high-pressure cryogenic liquid oxygen-hydrogen rocket model combustor. The combustor was operated at 6 MPa, above the supercritical pressure of the propellants. H-2 and H2O molecules were probed simultaneously using a dual-broadband CARS setup and degenerate CARS setup with a single dye laser. The diagnostic set-up at the test site was adapted to the high level of vibrations experienced during tests by several measures: the laser system was positioned in a separate room next to the test cell, a heavy-duty tri-axial translation stage for positioning the beam guiding optics and focusing lenses in the test cell was specially designed to be insensitive to vibrational excitation. The combustor was operated at two hydrogen injection temperatures, 65 and 117 K. In the low hydrogen temperature tests no CARS signal could be obtained. At a higher hydrogen temperature (similar to117 K), successful temperature mapping of the flame was performed at two cross-sections, 50 and 80 rum downstream of the injector. Bimodal temperature distributions were observed at the 80 mm position, indicating strong flame and flow oscillations. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB RHESSI is the sixth in the NASA line of Small Explorer (SMEX) missions and the first managed in the Principal Investigator mode, where the PI is responsible for all aspects of the mission except the launch vehicle. RHESSI is designed to investigate particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares, through imaging and spectroscopy of hard X-ray/gamma-ray continua emitted by energetic electrons, and of gamma-ray lines produced by energetic ions. The single instrument consists of an imager, made up of nine bi-grid rotating modulation collimators (RMCs), in front of a spectrometer with nine cryogenically-cooled germanium detectors (GeDs), one behind each RMC. It provides the first high-resolution hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy, the first high-resolution gamma-ray line spectroscopy, and the first imaging above 100 keV including the first imaging of gamma-ray lines. The spatial resolution is as fine as similar to 2.3 are see with a full-Sun (greater than or similar to1degrees) field of view, and the spectral resolution is similar to 1 - 10 keV FWHM over the energy range from soft X-rays (3 keV) to gamma-rays (17 MeV). An automated shutter system allows a wide dynamic range (> 10(7)) of flare intensities to be handled without instrument saturation. Data for every photon is stored in a solid-state memory and telemetered to the ground, thus allowing for versatile data analysis keyed to specific science objectives. The spin-stabilized (similar to 15 rpm) spacecraft is Sun-pointing to within similar to 0.2degrees and operates autonomously. RHESSI was launched on 5 February 2002, into a nearly circular, 38degrees inclination, 600-km altitude orbit and began observations a week later. The mission is operated from Berkeley using a dedicated 11-m antenna for telemetry reception and command uplinks. All data and analysis software are made freely and immediately available to the scientific community.

AB Control forces are required for steering a launch vehicle to guide it to follow an optimal trajectory. Launch vehicle control involves two control loops, the inner loop deals with short-period dynamics, stability and the outer loop, known as the guidance loop, optimises the trajectory. The general nonlinear plant model is first approximated as a linear time-varying plant over a nominal trajectory and then segmented as linear, time-invariant plant models at different time intervals. A major part of the plant model is the control power plant, which for a secondary injection thrust vector control system used for the solid.booster stage of a launch vehicle is nonlinear due to various reasons. The controllers designed for different time regimes assume the control power plant as linear and are adapted smoothly by a technique called gain scheduling to cope with the plant model changes wrt time. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based pre-compensator is developed to linearise the control power plant so that the controller design becomes valid. Simulation results are presented to validate the design and a novel preprocessing technique is developed to reduce the size of the fuzzy inference system.

AB A method of stretching optical fiber holds interest for measuring strain in smart structures where the physical displacement may be used to tune optical fiber lasers. A small, lightweight, tunable fiber laser is ideal for demodulating strain in optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) attached to smart structures such as the reusable launch vehicle that is being developed by NASA. A method is presented for stretching optical fibers using the thin-layer composite unimorph ferroelectric driver and sensor (THUNDER) piezoelectric actuators invented at NASA Langley Research Center. THUNDER actuators use a piezoelectric layer bonded to a metal backing to enable the actuators to produce displacements larger than the unbonded piezoelectric material. The shift in reflected optical wavelength resulting from stretching the FBG is presented. Means of adapting THUNDER actuators for stretching optical fibers are discussed, including ferrules, ferrule clamp blocks, and plastic hinges made with stereo lithography.

AB Combustion instability of O-2/kerosene, O-2/kerosene/hydrogen, and O-2/kerosene/hydrogen spray flame is numerically studied. The numerical results of combustion self-oscillation are consistent with the historical experiments. Hydrogen is helpful to stabilizing oxygen/hydrocarbon combustion. High gas injecting velocity of the coaxial injector would increase the combustion stability. Contrary to the former expectation, the most sensitive region for combustion instability is not where the heat releases most intensely but is the low-temperature premixed region near the injectors. According to the simulation, the technology steps, such as adding catalyzer to decrease the reaction activity energy, or improving the injector design to reduce the premixed low temperature region, would improve the combustion stability.

ID EMISSIVITY
AB Previously a fast multi-wavelength pyrometer was developed in a collaboration between the Harbin Institute of Technology of China and Rome University of Italy. The main features of the instrument include the use of a dispersing prism and a photodiode array to cover the entire spectral band. Following this experience, a new type of six-target eight-wavelength pyrometer for solid propellant rocket engine plume temperature distribution measurements has been developed. The instrument can record the radiation fluxes of eight wavelengths for six different uniformly distributed points on the target surface, which are well defined by holes on a field stop. The fast pyrometer with a specially designed synchronous data acquisition system can assure that the recorded thermal radiation fluxes of different spectral regions are at the same time and the same true temperature, even with dramatically changed targets.

AB An experimental program has been conducted to study the flow separation phenomena in a truncated ideal Contour rocket nozzle. Tests indicate that the off-design overexpanded nozzle flow was dominated by shock-induced boundary-layer separation that demonstrated fluctuating characteristics. The separation shock fluctuates back and forth, the intensity of which shows a strong dependence on the nozzle contour. Asymmetry in How separation was also observed at certain pressure ratios. The study was made using scblieren flow visualization and surface pressure measurements.

AB As part of phase 2 of the X-33 Program, NASA selected an integrated lifting body/aerospike engine configuration as the study vehicle for the conceptual analysis of a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle. A team at NASA Langley Research Center participated in the screening and evaluation of a number of proposed vehicle configurations in the early phases of the conceptual design process. The performance analyses that supported these studies were conducted to assess the effect of the vehicle's lifting capability, linear aerospike engine, and metallic thermal protection system on the weight and performance of the vehicle. These performance studies were conducted in a multidisciplinary fashion that indirectly linked the trajectory optimization with weight estimation and aerothermal analysis tools. This approach was necessary to develop optimized ascent and entry trajectories that met all vehicle design constraints. Significant improvements in ascent performance were achieved when the vehicle Hew a lifting trajectory and varied the engine mixture ratio during flight. Also, a considerable reduction in empty weight was possible by adjusting the total oxidizer-to-fuel and liftoff thrust-to-weight ratios. However, the optimal ascent flight profile had to be altered to ensure that the vehicle could be trimmed in pitch using only the How diverting capability of the aerospike engine. Likewise, the optimal entry trajectory had to be tailored to meet thermal protection system heating rate and transition constraints while satisfying a crossrange requirement.

However, the optimal ascent flight profile had to be altered to ensure that the vehicle could be trimmed in pitch using only the How diverting capability of the aerospike engine. Likewise, the optimal entry trajectory had to be tailored to meet thermal protection system heating rate and transition constraints while satisfying a crossrange requirement.

TI The MSG System
SO ESA BULLETIN-EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY

DT Article
AB The MSG System consists of a Space Segment and a Ground Segment. It is designed to provide data, products and services over a system lifetime of at least 12 years, based on a series of three satellites called MSG-1, -2 and -3. The MSG System will perform regular operations with one satellite at the nominal location of 0 deg longitude over the equator, and foresees a stand-by satellite that would be used in case of emergencies or during major configuration changes.
   The MSG Space Segment is being implemented by ESA, which is responsible for:
   the development and procurement of the first satellite, called MSG-1
   the procurement, on behalf of Eumetsat, of the two subsequent satellites, MSG-2 and MSG-3.
   The MSG Ground Segment has been developed by Eumetsat and consists of:
   a control, acquisition, pre-processing and dissemination ground segment composed of central facilities located at Eumetsat's Headquarters, and remote ground stations
   an Application Ground Segment, which extracts meteorological and geophysical products from the calibrated and geo-located image data generated by the Mission Control Centre, and performs data-management functions.
   Eumetsat is procuring the launch services for the MSG satellites, on the Ariane launch vehicle, and the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) services, which are controlled and provided by ESA's European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany.

AB Integral will be launched in October this year by a Russian Proton rocket into a highly elliptical orbit. The mission will be controlled from the Integral Operational Ground Segment, which will take charge of the satellite's operation from its separation from the launcher until the end of the mission. This article describes the ground-segment architecture and specifically the functionality of the Integral Operational Ground Segment. The latter's design is based on the latest ESA infrastructure develpments in the fields of mission-control systems (SCOS 2000), station modulation, demodulation and tracking systems, and interoperabillity between ESA and NASA/JPL for cross-support of the mission.

   rocket motor cases using weighted performance index
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE

DE maraging steel; materials behavior; rocket motor case; Weighted
   Performance Index (WPI)
AB Material selection is a very critical design decision, which has a profound influence on the entire development program for rocket motor cases. In the selection process, the main performance parameters and the most appropriate fabrication technology with proven processes must be considered. Many years of practical experience in material selection process with a thorough understanding of materials behavior under various loading environments and hands-on experiences with various available manufacturing processes are of immense help to the design and development engineer for successful completion of the development program. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present an approach for selecting appropriate material and manufacturing process for rocket motor case based on method of Weighted Performance Index (WPI) with the hope that this approach will also provide additional aid to the design engineer for the selection of material and manufacturing process for rocket motor cases. In this method, different properties are assigned a certain weight depending upon their importance to the service requirements. Different properties are normalized using a scaling factor, and finally a weighted property index is computed. The material that scored the maximum numerical value is chosen as the material for fabrication. This approach closely matches with the actual performance. Maraging steel and D6AC are found to be the preferred materials for rocket motor cases for critical missions. HSLA steels are appropriate for less-critical applications, in which rocket motor cases are required in very large numbers (e.g., flow-formed AISI 4130 motor cases([8])). For the selection of an appropriate manufacturing method, the major parameters considered are dimensional accuracy, cost of production, minimum material waste, and flexibility in design. Again, these properties are given a relative grading, which is then converted into a scaled property. Finally, the weighted performance indices are estimated. The flow-forming method has emerged as the manufacturing method of choice for motor tubes.

AB A numerical study of the cavitation behaviour of two-dimensional hydrofoils simulating a section of an inducer blade is presented. Two leading edge shapes were chosen to approach rocket engine inducer designs. They were tested with respect to the development of sheet cavitation. The numerical model of cavitating flows is based on the 3D code FINE/TURBOTI, developed by NUMECA International. The cavitation process is taken into account by using a single fluid model, which considers the liquid vapour mixture as a homogeneous fluid whose density varies with respect to the static pressure. Numerical results are compared with experimental ones, obtained in the CREMHyG large cavitation tunnel((1)). Pressure distributions along the foil suction side and the tunnel walls were measured for different cavity lengths. Total pressure measurements along the foil suction side allow characterizing the effects of cavitation on the liquid flow. Influence of the leading edge shape on the cavitation behaviour and comparison between experiments and numerical predictions are discussed.

AB The catalytic oxidation of unsymmetrical dimethythydrazine (UDMH) by air has been studied in a vibro-fluidized catalyst bed laboratory kinetic setup over catalysts CuxMg1-xCr2O4/gamma-Al2O3, 32.9%Ir/gamma-Al2O3 and beta-Si3N4 in a temperature range 150-400 degreesC. The catalyst CuxMg1-xCr2O4/gamma-Al2O3 was found to be optimal regarding high yields of CO2 and low yields of NOx. A probable mechanism of UDMH heterogeneous catalytic oxidation is proposed. Catalyst CuxMg1-xCr2O4/gamma-Al2O3 has been further used in the pilot plant specially designed for the destruction of UDMH. Results of testing the main fluidized bed catalytic reactor for UDMH oxidation and the reactor for selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 are presented. These results prove that the developed UDMH destruction technology is highly efficient and environmentally safe. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An innovative concept for the direct utilization of fusion energy with laser ignited (D,T) capsules for propulsion is presented with the so called VISTA (Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Applications) concept. VISTA's overall geometry is that of a 50degrees-half-angle cone to avoid massive radioactive shielding. The 50degrees-half-angle maximizes the jet efficiency, and is determined by selecting the optimum pellet firing position along the axis of the cone with respect to the plane of the magnet coil. The pellet firing position is in the vacuum. Assuming a total fusion power production of 17 500 MW with a repetition rate of 5 Hz and 3500 MJ per shot, the propulsion power in form of charged particles has been calculated as similar to7000 MW, making similar to40% of the total fusion power. About 60% of the fusion energy is carried by the leaking neutrons out of the pellet. Most of them (96%) escape into vacuum without striking the space ship. Only 4% enter the frozen hydrogen expellant in the conical shape (about 50 gr.). Two design limits are discussed, 5 and 1 mW/cm(3). Total peak nuclear heat generation in the coils is calculated as 4.7 mW/cm(3). The peak neutron heating is 1.9 mW/cm(3) and the peak gamma-ray heating density is 2.8 mW/cm(3). However, volume averaged nuclear heat generation in the coils is much lower. It is calculated as 0.18, 0.48, and 0.66 mW/cm(3) for neutron, gamma-ray, and total nuclear heating, respectively.
   With higher design limits for nuclear heat generation in the coils and using natural lithium in the shielding, it was possible to reduce the net shielding mass from 595 tonne down to 170 tonne, making <3% of the vehicle mass, by a total vehicle mass of VISTA &SIM; 6 000 tonne.

AB Fifteen years have passed since the Soviet Energiya heavy-lift launch vehicle made its maiden flight. After a follow-on flight carrying an unmanned Buran orbiter the programme was faced with the budget realities resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union, ultimately leading to its cancellation in the early 1990s. This paper will look at the origins of Energiya and Buran, the evolution of their design and the various launch vehicles that were derived from Energiya. One of the major sources used in this article are the recently published memoirs of Boris Gubanov, who was Energiya's chief designer from 1982 until 1992 [1].

TI Correlated time derivatives of current, electric field intensity, and
   magnetic flux density for triggered lightning at 15 m
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
LA English

ID TRANSMISSION-LINE MODEL; STROKES; RADIATION
AB [1] We present measured current and its time derivative correlated with the corresponding electric field intensity and magnetic flux density and their time derivatives measured at 15 m for two lightning return strokes triggered in 1999 at Camp Blanding, Florida. Lightning was triggered to a vertical 2-m rod mounted at the center of a 70 70 m buried metallic grid. The rocket-launching system was located underground at the center of the grid. The experiment was designed to minimize any influence of either the strike object or a finite-conducting Earth (ground surface arcing and propagation effects) on the fields and field derivatives. The measured current derivative waveform and the return stroke portion of the magnetic flux density derivative and electric field intensity derivative waveforms associated with the two strokes are observed to be essentially unipolar pulses that have similar waveshapes for the first 150 ns or so, including the initial rising portion, the peak, and about 50 ns after the peak. The current and magnetic field derivative waveshapes are very similar for their total duration, and both decay to near zero about 200 ns after the peak derivative is reached. The electric field derivative decays more slowly than the current derivative after about 150 ns, taking about 500 ns to decay to near zero. The transmission-line model, the simplest available and most used return stroke model, is employed to calculate the return stroke field derivatives, given the measured current derivative as a model input, for return stroke speeds of 1 x 10(8) m s(-1),2 x 10(8) m s(-1), and 3 x 10(8) m s(-1) (the speed of light). A reasonable match between calculated and measured field derivative waveshapes is achieved for both strokes for a return stroke speed between 2 10 8 m s 1 and 3 x 10(8) m s(-1). Although the measured field and current derivatives have similar waveshapes for about 150 ns, which might appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that the radiation field component of the total field derivative is dominant for that time, transmission line model calculations indicate that this is not the case. Further, electric field derivatives measured simultaneously at 15 m and at 30 m for many strokes are observed to have similar waveshapes, which also might appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that the derivatives are dominated by the radiation field component; however, according to transmission line model calculations, while the calculated total field derivative waveshapes are similar at 15 and 30 m, all field components significantly contribute to the waveforms at both distances, and the mix of field components at 15 m and at 30 m is quite different.

AB The characterization of the sensitivity to electrostatic discharge of solid propellants and the adaptation of the corresponding procedures in the production, handling, and operation of motors and systems using them have always been an essential part of the safety analysis of rocket systems. However, incidents or accidents have occurred during the past decades, which showed that the appreciation of the risks and the knowledge of the mechanisms of ignition were not sufficient. These incidents always involved hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene based aluminized composite propellants. After an analysis of the incidents, a new test was designed in France at the beginning of the 1980s in order to characterize propellants as sensitive or not sensitive, and. a criteria based on a percolation model was developed to classify propellant formulations. This test has never been contradicted by further experimental evidence. But other incidents or accidents happened later which showed that the model is not sufficient for some practical situations. and that the evaluation of the level of sensitivity of a sensitive propellant remains today a difficult problem. After a history of the main events in the field and of the efforts conducted for characterization, testing, and modeling of the sensitivity to electrostatic discharge during the last 25 years, recent findings on the effect of some factors are presented, and some directions for the future are described.

AB A coupled finite element fluid-structure interaction analysis of regeneratively cooled rocket combustion chambers, which allows the computation of the coolant flow and the heat conduction between the coolant and the combustion chamber structure, is presented. Furthermore, the resulting elasto-plastic deformation of the combustion chamber under cyclic thermal and mechanical loading is analyzed. The developed solution strategy is applied to the prediction of the heat transfer and thermomechanical load-induced deformation process of the European rocket engine Vulcain. Based on the results, the failure mechanism of the combustion chamber and its governing parameters are identified. It is demonstrated that this mechanism significantly reduces the lifetime of the rocket engine. Besides the conceptual design by the engineer, a mathematical optimization procedure based on the finite element model of the combustion chamber is investigated. This optimization method allows the improvement of an initial design with respect to a finite number of design variables such that the stress, plastic strain, or temperature levels are decreased, and accordingly, the lifetime will be increased.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

AB Rapid response to a high-speed, low-altitude, incoming missile imposes very stringent design requirements on an air-defense missile, the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile. A successful solution was devised using a jet vane control system for missile maneuvering during the boost phase of the shipboard vertical launch. By the location aft of the rocket motor nozzle, the vanes are inserted into the propellant stream for the purpose of generating maneuvering forces. After rocket motor burn out, the jet vane assembly detaches from the missile and falls away to not degrade the rocket motor specific impulse during flight to target. The four vanes are mounted at right angles to each other with each having its own mounting support and geartrain assembly. Each vane is connected through a detachable coupling to the steering control system of the missile, such that actuation of the steering control simultaneously actuates the jet vanes. The Evolved SeaSparrow Missile consortium successfully designed, analyzed, prototype developed, and flight tested a jet vane control prototype and has implemented the design into the program. Empirical test data were found to correlate well with the analytical techniques used to predict vane performance and resulted in a system capable of meeting the missile operational requirements.

TI First-stage design variations of partially reusable launch vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Different types of reusable first stages designed for a near-term application with heavy lift launchers are investigated. The attached reference expendable space transportation system is a future Ariane 5 with cryogenic core and upper stage but skipped solid rocket boosters. The design of the so-called liquid flyback boosters is restricted to the incorporation of powerful hydrogen or hydrocarbon rocket motors already under development or in operation. The analyzed layout variants of the reusable vehicle include single- as well as dual-booster configurations. Catamaran-type double fuselage stages are investigated to evaluate the potential in reducing the unsymmetrical thrust load of one-side-mounted booster. Along with their primary use to boost heavy lift geostationary transfer-orbit missions, a second task may be covered by the same vehicle to accelerate the upper stages of small and medium launchers. The additional design requirements in such a dual-use reusable launch vehicle are studied. The investigation includes trajectory simulations and optimizations for ascent, as well as an assessment of propellant requirements and vehicle loads during return flight to the launch site. Critical flight stability aspects are evaluated by static and dynamic simulations. A comparison of size and mass is included, as well as performance data of the different liquid flyback booster configurations. The relevant rocket engine figures of performance, mass, reusability, and throttling capability are presented.

AB This paper presents the detailed numerical analysis including parametric studies on the aerodynamic excitation mechanisms in a turbine stage due to the unsteady stator-rotor interaction, The work is part of the predesign study of a high-pressure subsonic turbine,for a rocket engine turbopump. The pressure level in such turbines can be remarkably high (in this case 54 MPa inlet total pressure). Hence, large unsteady rotor blade loads can be expected, which impose difficult design requirements, The parameter studies are performed at midspan with the numerical flow solver UNSFLO, a 2-D/Q3-D unsteady hybrid Euler/Navier-Stokes solver. Comparisons to 2-D and steady, 3-D results obtained with a fully viscous solver VOLSOL, are made. The investigated design parameters are the axial gap (similar to8-29 percent of rotor axial chord length) and the stator vane size and count (stator-rotor pitch ratio similar to1-2.75), For the nominal case the numerical solution is analyzed regarding the contributions of potential and vortical flow disturbances at the rotor inlet using rotor gust computations. It was found that gust calculations were not capable to capture the complexity of the detected excitation mechanisms, but the possibility to reduce excitations by enforcing cancellation of the vortical and potential effects has been elaborated. The potential excitation mechanism in the present turbine stage is found dominant compared to relatively small and local wake excitation effects. The parameter studies indicate design recommendations for the axial gap and the stator size regarding the unsteady rotor load.

TI Effect of microgravity on optical degradation in heavy metal fluoride
   glasses processed on the CSAR-II sounding rocket
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE

DT Article
ID CRYSTALLIZATION; GRAVITY; FIBERS
AB The optical properties of heavy metal fluoride (HMF) glasses degrade during the fibre drawing process due to undesired micro-crystal formation. Since gravity-driven density segregation is believed to be a major cause for homogeneous nucleation in viscous glasses during their ground-based processing, use of microgravity during such processes should minimize micro-crystal formation and resulting optical degradation. Our research on HMF glasses has been aimed at seeking experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. Earlier results from our experiments on the T-33 aircraft and the CSAR-I sounding rocket had indicated that microgravity helps in reducing crystallization in HMF glasses during their heat treatment at temperatures above 325degreesC. This temperature is very close to the fibre drawing temperature range of 300-320degreesC in these glasses, and implies that crystal nucleation and optical degradation may occur during fibre drawing. Therefore, the CSAR-II sounding rocket experiments were conducted on HMF glass samples at processing temperatures within the fibre drawing region. The results of CSAR-II sounding rocket experiments are in tune with the earlier findings and indicate that microgravity helps in reducing optical degradation in HMF glasses during their processing at temperatures in the fibre drawing region.

CT 49th International Astronautical Congress
CY SEP 28-OCT 02, 1998
CL MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA
AB The electrostatic levitation furnace (ELF) is one of the experimental facilities for materials science research planned to be embarked on the International Space Station. The most significant feature of the ELF is that it creates a free-drifting space inside the furnace chamber by controlling the experimental materials not to collide against the chamber wall. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the control system of the ELF and to show the results of a flight test on a small sounding rocket, called TR-1A. By adopting high-speed position detectors and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) technique, rapid calculation of material's position up to 1000 Hz realized. The maximum control input (voltage) and the control cycle were chosen as 3 kV and 100 Hz, respectively. The flight data show that complete melting solidification of the material (0.5 g BiFeO3) vas accomplished. Though the material's motion was fully controlled during the experiment, unexpected shaking occurred at high temperature due to a sudden drop of electrostatic charge. This phenomenon is understood as the most important issue to be solved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The MARTEL test rig of Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, located in Poitiers, France, is designed to study the noise of highly supersonic hot jets under conditions approaching those of a launch vehicle at liftoff. The nonanechoic character of the site (concrete ground, large plate representing the launch pad) requires a specific measurement device in order to calculate the sound power radiated by the jets. The integration process defined by ONERA is discussed and is tested using a freejet noise model derived from the work of NASA, which has been extended to the jet-plate interaction by assuming that the sound power radiated by the jet remains unchanged in this case. First results concerning jets of various velocities seem to confirm the preceding hypothesis and the reliability of the method used.

TI Pioneer Rocketplane conceptual design study
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
AB The Pioneer Rocketplane is a two-seat, F-111-sized aircraft powered by turbofan engines and a kerosene/oxygen-burning RD-120 rocket engine that, using an expendable upper stage, boosts a 3000-lb satellite to a circular low Earth orbit. The Rocketplane takes off with its turbofan engines and climbs to approximately 20,000 ft, where it meets a tanker aircraft, taking on about 48,000 lb of kerosene jet fuel. The Rocketplane then moves to a second tanker aircraft, where it takes on about 130,000 lb of liquid oxygen. After disconnecting from the tanker, the vehicle ignites its rocket engine and climbs to an altitude of 70 miles. Although never reaching orbit itself, the Rocketplane is outside the sensible atmosphere. It opens its payload bay doors and releases the upper stage, which ignites and delivers the satellite payload to its intended low Earth orbit. The doors are then closed, and the aircraft reenters the atmosphere and lands. The second phase conceptual design study is described in which prior configuration design and optimization studies have been integrated into a viable baseline air vehicle concept on which performance analysis is conducted.

TI Rocket nozzle flow control using a reduced-order computational fluid
   dynamics model
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced-order computational fluid dynamics models for multidisciplinary optimization are investigated. An open-loop optimal control problem is solved concerning the regulation of a rocket engine thrust profile. The control synthesis uses a numerical flowfield solver as the plant model. Controllers are synthesized using both the full-order nonlinear fluid dynamics, which serves as a truth model, and a reduced-order model of the flowfield generated via proper orthogonal decomposition. The latter has been successfully applied to reduce the order of both steady and unsteady subsonic flowfield solutions obtained via computational fluid dynamics. Specifically, the application of reduced-order flowfield solvers to a rocket's thrust controller design is explored. A quasi-one-dimensional supersonic convergent-divergent nozzle with varying backpressure is used as a model problem. Treating the nozzle flow as one-dimensional, the reduced-order model is used to synthesize a nonlinear controller that controls thrust by varying nozzle throat area along an ascent trajectory. The performance of the reduced-order controller is quantified.

ID DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; FLOW
AB There is growing interest to adopt supersonic turbines for rocket propulsion, However, this technology has not been actively investigated in the United States for the last three decades. To aid design improvement, a global optimization framework combining the radial-basis neural network (NN) and the polynomial response surface (RS) method is constructed for shape optimization of a two-stage supersonic turbine, involving O(10) design variables. The design of the experiment approach is adopted to reduce the data size needed by the optimization task. The combined NN and RS techniques are employed. A major merit of the RS approach is that it enables one to revise the design space to perform multiple optimization cycles. This benefit is realized when an optimal design approaches the boundary of a predefined design space. Furthermore, by inspecting the influence of each design variable, one can also gain insight into the existence of multiple design choices and select the optimum design based on other factors such as stress and materials consideration.

TI Multiobjective optimization of rocket engine pumps using evolutionary
   algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A design optimization method for turbopumps of cryogenic rocket engines has been developed. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used for multiobjective pump design optimizations. Performances of design candidates are evaluated by using the meanline pump flow-modeling method based on the Euler turbine equation coupled with empirical correlations for rotor efficiency. To demonstrate feasibility of the present approach, single-stage centrifugal pump and multistage pump design optimizations are performed. The number of pump performance evaluations necessary to obtain a reasonable pareto-optimal set for the conceptual rocket engine pump design will be investigated using the single-stage centrifugal pump design optimization. In both design optimizations the present method obtains hundreds of reasonable and uniformly distributed pareto-optimal solutions that include some designs outperforming the original design in total head while reducing input power by 1 %. Detailed observation of the design results also reveals some important design criteria for turbopumps in cryogenic rocket engines. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the evolutionary algorithm-based multiobjective design optimization method in this field.

ID TENNIS RACKET; ELBOW
AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the biomechanical effects of different types of braces that are used in the treatment of patients with epicondylitis radialis. Vibration and acceleration of the forearm and the elbow were measured with sensors taped to defined anatomic points on the skin surface, The impact-induced vibration of the rocket-arm system was analyzed while the subjects were playing tennis. Different designed brace systems were investigated with respect to acceleration amplitudes and acceleration integrals. Clasp-based brace systems showed a slight reduction of acceleration amplitudes (- 6%) and acceleration integrals (- 8%). Braces with pads at the lateral epicondyle reduced acceleration amplitudes by 20% and acceleration integrals by 22%. Braces with pads placed at the forearm showed the highest reduction of acceleration amplitudes (- 46%) and acceleration integrals (- 42%). Overload of the wrist extensors, which is considered to be a major pathogenic factor in lateral epicondylitis, can be reduced by braces. There is a significant difference in the effects among different biomechanical principles of braces.

TI Optimized solutions for Kistler K-1 branching trajectories using
   multidisciplinary design optimization techniques
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle designs that incorporate branching trajectories during their ascent are of current interest in the advanced launch vehicle design community. Unlike expendable vehicle designs, the booster of a two-stage reusable system must fly to a designated landing site after staging. Because of a mutual dependence on the staging conditions, both the booster flyback branch and the orbital branch of the ascent trajectory must be simultaneously optimized to achieve an overall system objective. The optimum solution is often a compromise between the local objectives of the two branches. Current and notable designs in this class include the U.S. Air Force Space Operations Vehicle designs, the Kelly Astroliner, the Kistler K-1, and NASA's proposed liquid flyback booster designs (space shuttle booster replacement). Solution techniques are introduced that are well suited to solving this class of problem with existing single-segment trajectory optimization codes. In particular, these methods originate from the field of multidisciplinary design optimization and include optimization-based decomposition and collaborative optimization. The results of applying these techniques to the branching trajectory optimization problem for the Kistler K-I launch vehicle are given and conclusions are drawn with respect to computational efficiency and quality of the results. In general, partial optimization-based decomposition was preferred due to its superior robustness, ease of setup, fast execution time, and optimality of the results.

AB The integration of propellant within a silicon micromachined systems enables the realization of a new class of MEMS devices called microscale rocket. These new devices seem to respond to a real need in the field of high energetic microscale actuation. Their main originality is the use of only one solid propellant loaded in a small tank micromachined in a ceramic or silicon substrate, The structure consists of a sandwich of three micromachined silicon substrates: nozzles, igniters and propellant chambers. The thrust force issued from the combustion of the solid propellant ranges from 1 mN to a few mN. Just by geometrical and dimensional considerations, it is possible to adapt the thrust impulse depending on the application requirements. One identified application of microrockets is space with the realization of microscale thrusters for the control of the attitude or/and the station keeping of very small satellite.
   In a first part of the paper, we present the process of fabrication and the assembling of microthrusters as well as the specific equipment developed to load the solid propellant into microcavities. On a second part, we present briefly the modeling tools developed to predict the (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. thruster performances.

AB This paper addresses the comulation of file required trajectory correction maneuvers for a halo orbit space mission to compensate for the launch velocity errors introduced by inaccuracies of the launch vehicle. By combining dynamical systems theory with optimal control techniques. we are able to provide a compelling portrait of the complex landscape of the trajectory design space. This approach enables automation of the analysis to perform parametric Studies that simply ere not available to mission designers a few years ago, such as hock the magnitude of the errors and the timing of the first trajectory correction maneuver affects the correction DeltaV. The impetus for combining dynamical systems theory and optimal control in this problem arises from design issues for the Genesis Discovery Mission being developed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

TI Mass spectrometric study of combustion and thermal decomposition of GAP
SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME
LA English
DT Article
ID LASER-INDUCED DECOMPOSITION; AZIDE POLYMER GAP; ENERGETIC MATERIALS
AB Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) is an active energetic binder in rocket propellants. The main objective of this research was to study the decomposition and combustion chemistry of thoroughly characterized GAP samples to develop a model for the combustion of GAP and propellants based on GAP. The combustion characteristics (burning rates, temperature profiles) and kinetic parameters (order of reaction, activation energy, pre-exponential factor of rate constants) for the thermal decomposition of GAP together with the composition of the products of both the combustion and decomposition of unerosslinked GAP (with a molecular weight of 350 or 2000) and cured GAP were studied. The flame and thermal decomposition of GAP, as well as the composition of the products were studied using molecular-beam mass-spectrometry (MBMS). The final temperature of a flame of GAP was measured as 1000 to 1100 K. About half of the mass of the combustion products involves large fragments of a polymer without its azide groups. For this reason the mass spectrum obtained on direct MBMS sampling of a flame burning GAP could not be completely interpreted. However, similar to47% of the mass of the combustion products was found to be the volatile gases N-2, H-2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, NH3, H2O, acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, and furane, as obtained by mass-spectrometry using freezing/ thawing in a liquid nitrogen trap.
   The thermal decomposition of thin films of GAP at 1 bar was done in a flow reactor with At flowing through it. A tungsten plate was used as a sample heater; its temperature was controlled using a chromel-copel (copel is an alloy of 56.5% Cu, 43.0% Ni and 0.5% Mn) or Pt-PtRh (I0%) thermocouples. The thermal decomposition of GAP was studied at a high heating rate over a wide temperature range in three ways: (1) the heating rate was changed from the maximal to the minimal one in the course of decomposition (400-100 K/s): (2) at the linear heating rate (50-400 K/s); (3) fast heating (similar to400 K/s) to the given temperature and subsequently maintained isothermal. Three stages of thermal decomposition were found. The first stage (yield of nitrogen is similar to15%) is a first order reaction. The second stage (yield of N-2 is similar to25%) is an autocatalytic one; the third stage is first order and is a weakly exothermic one. with a yield of nitrogen of similar to60%. Kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor of rate constants) were found for each stage. The results for both the combustion and thermal decomposition of GAP were compared with literature data and it was concluded that the results strongly depend on the conditions of the experiment and on the source of the GAP.

AB Lightning triggered from natural thunderclouds using the rocket-and-wire technique was employed in order to subject to direct lightning strikes the lightning protective system of a test house at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) at Camp Blanding, FL. The electrical circuit of the test house was connected to the secondary of a padmount distribution transformer located a distance of about 50 in from the house. The transformer primary was connected to a 650-m long unenergized underground power cable. The test house had two ground rods, one for the lightning protective system grounding and the other for the power supply system grounding. The two rods were about 3 m apart and were connected by a metallic cable. Lightning current was injected into the lightning protective system ground rod, and the currents and voltages at different points in the test system were measured. The waveshapes of currents in the ground rods of the test house differed markedly from the current waveshapes in other parts of the overall system. The ground rods at the test house appeared to filter out the higher frequency components of the lightning current, allowing the lower frequency components of the current to enter the house's electrical circuit, that is, the ground rods appeared to exhibit a capacitive behavior rather than the often expected resistive behavior. This effect was observed for dc grounding resistances of the rods (driven in sandy soil with conductivity of about 2.5 x 10(-4) S/m) ranging from more than a thousand ohms to some tens of ohms. The peak values of 1) the current entering the test house's electrical circuit, 2) the current flowing to the distribution transformer secondary neutral, and 3) the current flowing through the surge protective devices at the test house's service entrance were observed to be greater than in either of the two scenarios suggested by the International Electrotechnical Commission.

AB Test results are presented for the rotordynamic coefficients of a hybrid bearing that is representative of bearings for liquid-rocket-engine turbopump applications. The bearing is tested in the following two degraded conditions: (a) one of five orifices plugged, and (b) a locally enlarged clearance to simulate a worn condition. Test data are presented at 24,600 rpm, with supply pressures of 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 MPa, and eccentricity ratios from 0.1 to 0.5 in 0.1 increments. Overall, the results suggest that neither a single plugged orifice nor significant wear on the bearing land will "disable" a well-designed hybrid bearing. These results do not speak to multiple plugged orifices and are not an endorsement for operations without filters to prevent plugging orifices.

ID MISSION
AB We present a new instrument for space-based observational solar physics, recently flown successfully on a sounding rocket, designed to provide high spatial resolution, time-resolved images of the solar corona at specific wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV). The primary instrument employs multilayer x-ray mirrors in a novel geometry that affords quasi-monochromatic imaging at wavelengths tunable continuously over the spectral range from 17.1 to 21.1 nm. The secondary instrument also uses multilayer x-ray mirrors to provide high-resolution imaging at three fixed XUV wavelength bands. Both instruments use charge coupled device detectors and thin A1 filters for rejection of unwanted wavelengths. We describe the design, construction, and performance of the instrument and discuss prospects for the future. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.

AB A method was developed to measure the gas temperature in the chamber of solid rocket motor by using the double line of atomic emission spectroscopy. The measurement system had been designed. In this method. the spectral signal of the bun-ling gas with high pressure and high temperature in the solid rocket motor chamber was transfer into the spectroscopic system by using a quartz optic fiber. The effect of the spectral radiance and spectral transmissivity on the spectral measurement was decreased extremely by using two spectral lines that the interval was very small. A pressure-resistant probe was designed and applied, which guarantee the sealing ability and the spectral transmissivity of measurement system under the high-pressure and erosion experimental condition, The distributions of gas temperatures vs. time in the chambers of solid rocket motor that charged in the SQ-2 propellants were measured in situ and real time. The time resolution can highly reach 0.5 Vs.

AB Many advanced technologies based on particulate materials demand the availability of fine spherical powders or spherical powders of a narrow particle size class. Generally, high-pressure gas atomization (HPGA) is a close-coupled discrete jet atomization method and is one of the most effective methods of producing such powders. Development of HPGA nozzles with discrete jets resembling convergent - divergent (C - D) rocket nozzle designs, instead of the previous cylindrical jets, was conducted to increase atomization efficiency and uniformity and to reduce the required gas supply pressures. Results of compressible gas flow measurements on both types of HPGA nozzles revealed a steadily increasing trend of gas mass flow with gas supply pressure and a positive deviation from isentropic behavior that increases for increasing supply pressure. This has been attributed to an insufficient volume in the atomization nozzle gas manifold that experiences enhanced expansion cooling at increasing pressures. In experiments on 316L stainless steel, the atomization efficiency of the HPGA nozzle with C-D jets was higher than that of the HPGA nozzle with cylindrical jets, reflecting a lower gas/metal mass flow ratio. In other words, while the powder size distributions were nearly the same for all of the HPGA experiments, the HPGA nozzle with C-D jets utilized atomization gas with a significantly reduced operating pressure and mass flow rate.

DT Article
AB Recently, there has been an increased need for evolved space transportation and the research of reusable rocket which enable low cost and high reliability and is generating a lot of interest all over the world. In the USA, the development of reusable launch vehicle "Venture Star" which will be used instead of space shuttle is planned and its half scale model "X-33" was developed for the first flight in 1999. In Japan, there has been agreement on the main points to develop the rocket type RLV based on the technology of H-IIA, HOPE-X before developing space plane type RLV. The planned reusable rocket engine was LOX/LH2 as propellant, has 100-200 ton thrust and has a throttling capability. In addition, long life and high reliability are required for the engine system including LOX/LH2 turbopump.
   The paper introduces some key technologies for the reusable turbopump which IHI is promoting for research and development with NAL and Tohoku University. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Carbon/carbon extendible nozzles
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB For many years, SEP has developed C-C composite materials to lighten architectures of propulsion systems, thanks to their high specific mechanical properties kept up to about 2500degreesC.
   The 3D carbon reinforcement the so-called Novoltex(R) has emerged, and today more than 150 tons per year of C-C is produced by SEP using it.
   The advent of these thermostructural composite materials have blazed a trail for innovative solutions applicable to the extreme operating conditions of large rocket engines, to improve their performances. The extendible nozzle concept has been developed to optimize the expansion ratio with regard to size restriction required particularly for the upper stages of launchers.
   The first two tests of a SEP extendible nozzle extension were carried out in 1979, one on a ring design and one on a panel design. Today, nearly all possible configurations have been tested, from the simple scenario of extending a ring from a fixed nozzle prior to ignition, to the most complex one: nozzle deployment while the motor is operating and when the nozzle is being vectored.
   In August 1995, Pratt & Whitney have entrusted SEP with the development of the C-C exit cone dedicated to the RL10 B-2 cryotechnic engine, propulsion system of the DELTA III upper stage. One year later, in August 1996, SEP delivered the first development item which is currently under testing.
   When the entire C-C nozzle is attached to the RL10 B-2 engine and deployed, the nozzle diameter increases from 1.1 to 2.1 in and translates to 2.5 m in length, providing an expansion ratio of 285:1 and 30 s of specific impulse increase to the engine.
   Finally, the paper will describe the design and manufacturing of this huge exit cone and will report the latest test results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The problems of robust stability and robust stabilization of uncertain linear systems with distributed delay occurring in the state variables are studied in this paper. The essential requirement for the uncertainties is that they are norm-bounded with known bounds. Conditions for the robust stability of distributed time delay systems are given and a design method for the robust stabilizing control law of the uncertain systems is presented. The proposed method is applied to the stabilization of combustion in the chamber of a liquid monopropellant rocket motor. It is found that the combustion can be robustly stabilized when the two parameters pressure exponent gamma and maximal time lag r vary in specified intervals, respectively.

AB An International Team consisting of DuPont Superconductivity, Oak Ridge National Lab, the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory, and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. has designed and fabricated a conduction-cooled High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) coil for use in the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR). The HTS coil will be installed and tested in the ongoing VASIMR experiment at the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX. The HTS coil is 0.04 m in length, with a 0.23 m inner diameter, and has a mass less than 5.0 kg. The central operating magnetic field is a nominal 0.28 T with a design operating current of similar to105 A. The HTS coil is conduction cooled with a nominal operating temperature of 40 K. The HTS conductor uses a Bi-2223 material with a stainless steel backing strip for reinforcement. Details and test results of the mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic analyses are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT

DT Article
AB Aerodynamic coefficients of the National Aerospace Laboratory experimental airplane piggybacked on a solid rocket booster in ascent are numerically evaluated by solving the Euler equations on unstructured tetrahedral grids. For accurate representation of the configuration, a computational method has been developed. The method effectively links a computer-aided-design-based modeling to the efficient surface meshing. It also enables quick addition/removal of the small components attached on the original model to investigate their aerodynamic effects. The computed lift coefficients show good agreement with wind-tunnel data in all regions of flight speed from transonic to supersonic flow. It is made clear that a small component affects physical phenomena the flowfield, and as a consequence, the total aerodynamic performance of the airplane is largely changed. It is concluded that the detailed representation of the original geometry is very important for accurate evaluation of the transonic lift coefficients.

AB This paper summarizes experimental and computational results of research on propellant mixing and combustion in high-pressure LOX/GH2 rocket combustors. Hot-fire tests and numerical experiments are utilized to get more detailed information about the physics of mixing and combustion under high-pressure (transcritical) conditions. Time- and length scales of the reacting shear layer are identified by results from numerical simulation and experiments. The comparison between numerical and experimental results show the same tendencies of the distribution of length scales within the reactive shear layer. It was ascertained that the length scales are increasing downstream of the injector face plate. Qualitative and quantitative data about the flowlield (morphology, velocity species distribution, etc.) at different boundary conditions are presented.

TI Sizing a slingatron-based space launcher

DT Article
ID MASS
AB A slingatron is the name given to a propellantless mechanical means of launching a projectile. To date, slingatrons are only conceptual in nature, but their potential use as a ground-to-space launch mechanism for unmanned payloads is under investigation. Slingatrons can be configured in a variety of geometries; one form consists of a spiral track (or launch tube) that gyrates at a constant frequency about a set radius. Under proper conditions (design parameters), a projectile entering the spiral at its small radius end will undergo nearly constant tangential acceleration before exiting. The differential equations governing the motion of the projectile within the spiral are highly nonlinear, making the optimum design solution nonintuitive. This paper briefly describes how the slingatron works, then uses the numerical integration procedures within the computer software environment of Simulink(R) and MATLAB(R) to search for the minimum-sized slingatron needed to launch a 1000-kg projectile into space.

AB This article develops a general framework for identifying error and uncertainty in computational simulations that deal with the numerical solution of a set of partial differential equations (PDEs). A comprehensive, new view of the general phases of modeling and simulation is proposed, consisting of the following phases: conceptual modeling of the physical system, mathematical modeling of the conceptual model, discretization and algorithm selection for the mathematical model, computer programming of the discrete model, numerical solution of the computer program model, and representation of the numerical solution. Our view incorporates the modeling and simulation phases that are recognized in the systems engineering and operations research communities, but it adds phases that are specific to the numerical solution of PDEs. In each of these phases, general sources of uncertainty, both aleatory and epistemic, and error are identified. Our general framework is applicable to any numerical discretization procedure for solving ODEs or PDEs. To demonstrate this framework, we describe a system-level example: the flight of an unguided, rocket-boosted, aircraft-launched missile. This example is discussed in detail at each of the six phases of modeling and simulation. Two alternative models of the flight dynamics are considered, along with aleatory uncertainty of the initial mass of the missile and epistemic uncertainty in the thrust of the rocket motor. We also investigate the interaction of modeling uncertainties and numerical integration error in the solution of the ordinary differential equations for the flight dynamics.

AB A study has been made to modify an existing Sparrow Guidance Section (GS) for the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM). Sparrow is a legacy,Air Intercept Missile (AIM) while the ESSM is an Air Breathing Threat (ABT) interceptor. The Sparrow GS Fuselage, an aluminum structure originally designed in the early 1970's for jet fighter air carriage, was evaluated for use in the ESSM fight loads and thermal environments. This paper summarizes the legacy, research and trade studies performed that led to a recommended structural approach for the ESSM GS Fuselage design. The critical ESSM flight requirement driving the structural analysis was the terminal phase maneuver occurring 5 to 10 seconds after rocket motor burn-out, when the airframe is experiencing maximum fight temperatures. The superposition of temperature and loading was not seen in the Sparrow environments. Due to the superposition of temperature and stress, severe degradation of an ESSM aluminum shell structure it-as predicted since the allowable stresses were reduced to a fraction of the values exhibited at room temperature. Five redesign options were identified to enable the GS Fuselage to withstand the new ABT interceptor flight requirements, but only three options were judged to be promising, given the launcher it-eight constraints for the surface-to-air configured missile. The first, low risk solution was to simply overwrap the aluminum GS Fuselage and Proximity Fuze Antennas with tape wound, quartz-reinforced bismaleimide (BMI) to serve as a thermal protection system (TPS), increasing cost and weight while degrading Fuze Antenna performance. The second solution proposed was to convert the GS Fuselage to titanium, assuming the weight and cost increase can be absorbed elsewhere within the ESSM vehicle. The third, more innovative, approach is to redesign the GS Fuselage with high temperature fiber-reinforced organic materials, incorporating the quartz/BMI TPS of the first option as the redesigned Fuze Antenna Radome. A BMI tape wound cylindrical airframe with titanium, or corrosion resistant steel (CRES), metal rings at the joint interfaces is a lower cost and lighter weight concept compared to the two previous, more traditional options. Weight and cost would be further reduced if the Fuze Antennas can be co-cured into the GS composite laminate structure, minimizing fabrication process difficulties and inspection requirements. This study, supports other Raytheon examinations into the applicability of high temperature composite materials for supersonic interceptor airframes because of their considerable advantages in weight reduction, manufacturing flexibility, performance enhancements, and lower cost.

These data are subsequently used to derive the theoretical electron density diagnostic emission line intensity ratios R-1 = I(215.16 Angstrom)/I(299.50 Angstrom), R-2 = I(218.19 Angstrom)/I(299.50 Angstrom), R-3 = I(288.40 Angstrom)/I(299.50 Angstrom), R-4 = I(221.41 Angstrom)/I(299.50 Angstrom). A comparsion of these with observational data for solar active regions and flares, obtained with the Naval Research Laboratory's S082A spectrograph on board Skylab and the Solar EUV Rocket Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS), reveals that the electron densities determined from R-1, R-3, and R-4 are consistent with each other. In addition, the densities deduced from these ratios are in good agreement with those estimated from diagnostic lines in Fe XIV or Fe XV, which are formed at similar electron temperatures to S XII. However, the R-2 ratios in the flare observations imply densities smaller than those from Fe XIV/Fe XV, although the active region measurements do not show such discrepancies, suggesting that the 218.19 Angstrom line may be blended with a transition from a high-temperature ion. An emission feature in the SERTS active region spectrum at 215.29 Angstrom, previously identified as the 2s2p P-3(2)-2s3s S-3(1) transition in O V, may be due primarily to the S XII 215.16 Angstrom line.

AB Some tools focused on a rapid multidisciplinary optimization capability for multistage launch vehicle design were developed at EADS-LV.
   These tools may be broken down into two categories, those related to propulsion design optimization and a computer code devoted to trajectories and under constraints optimization. Both are linked in order to obtain optimal vehicle design after,an iterative process. After a description of the two categories tools, an example of application is given on a small space launcher.

AB A 100 m long, disused urban storm tank built in the 1920s is now serving as the foundation for the UK's exciting new National Space Centre on the banks of the River Soar in Leicester. The Millennium Commission funded project has set a new benchmark for urban regeneration, not only for its skillful reuse of redundant infrastructure but also for its innovative approaches to structural design, internal climate control and contamination management. It features a 40 m high 'bubble-wrapped' rocket tower, a complex combination of naturally vented and air-conditioned internal spaces and a large, unden-vented car-parking area to cover the most contaminated parts of the site.

AB Mission success depends on proper integration of safety, risk management, and assurance processes throughout the project life-cycle. In the current government acquisition environment great emphasis is being placed on innovative contracting approaches that involve cooperative agreements, performance-based contracting, and contractor use of best practices. Thus, far fewer prescribed standards and specifications are involved in government acquisition today as compared to the early 1990's. Additionally, the shift from rule-based assurance management to knowledge-based approaches poses a separate set of challenges as clearly underscored in government and industry accident assessments and mishap investigations that followed a costly streak of launch vehicle and spacecraft failures in the late 1990 time frame. In response to these challenges the NASA Off-ice of Safety & Mission Assurance began development of the Process Based Mission Assurance Knowledge Management System (PBMA-K-MS) in mid 1999. The PBMA-KMS is a user-friendly, web-based system designed to support life-cycle safety and mission success management, This paper describes the PBMA-KMS functionality, operation, and plans for future growth. Aerospace professionals are encouraged to use the PBMA-KMS by participating in discipline oriented work groups, and contributing best practices, lessons teamed, and ideas for future functional enhancements.

AB The ablution, mechanical and thermal properties of vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) (Pyrograf III(TM) Applied Sciences, Inc.)/phenolic resin (SC-1008, Borden Chemical, Inc.) composites were evaluated to determine the potential of using this material in solid rocket motor nozzles. Composite specimens with varying VGCF loadings (30-50% wt.) including one sample with ex-rayon carbon fiber plies were prepared and exposed to a plasma torch for 20 s with a heat flux of 16.5 MW/m(2) at approximately 1650degreesC. Low erosion rates and little char formation were observed, confirming that these materials were promising for rocket motor nozzle materials. When fiber loadings increased, mechanical properties and ablative properties improved. The VGCF composites had low thermal conductivities (approximately 0.56 W/ m-K) indicating they were good insulating materials. If a 65% fiber loading in VGCF composite could be achieved, then ablative properties are projected to be comparable to or better than the composite material currently used on the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM).

AB The launcher hold and release system (LHRS) was successfully used, for the first time, for GSLV-D1 mission after thorough test and evaluation, in line with reliability and quality assurance (R&QA) requirements. Various R&QA techniques are applied to make LHRS failure-free, Failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) was used as a tool for identifying critical failure modes. Single-point failure modes (SPFMs) identified from FMECA are strengthened by design modifications and the same are verified by testing, Testing philosophy is tailored to have more number of tests at the system level. Capability demonstration tests and failure mode simulation tests were carried out during system qualification phase. Acceptance tests are done on the flight hardware at launch pad to demonstrate better confidence on the system. This paper illustrates how R&QA techniques complimented and added value at different stages in the development cycle of LHRS, by means of few case studies. Testing methodologies adopted and problems encountered during the development and qualification phases are described in brief. Various problems surfaced during preparation for flight are also discussed.

AB We have developed a new direct-drive target design that has a predicted energy gain of 127 using a 1.3 MJ KrF laser, and a gain of 155 using 3.1 MJ. The DT fuel is surrounded by an ablator consisting of a low density CH foam filled with frozen DT. The ablator is then surrounded by a thin CH coating and a very thin high-Z overcoat. The energy gain of 127-155 is possible through the use of (1) direct-drive laser-target coupling; (2) controlled levels of radiative preheating that keeps the DT fuel on a low isentrope (3) a short 1/4 mum laser wavelength for maximum absorption and rocket efficiencies; (4) reduction of the laser beam focal spot size during the implosion (zooming) so that the focal spot size better matches the imploding target size; and (5) ISI optical smoothing to minimize the laser nonuniformities at both high and low mode numbers. In addition to its high energy gain, this target design has several other attractive features: a low target fabrication cost; the potential for a modest-size 300 MWe power plant; the physical strength to withstand the acceleration into the chamber; and a high infrared albedo to better protect the target from preheating during the injection into the chamber.

AB There is a need to design a reliable lightweight solid rocket motor case, pressure vessel for a launch vehicle or a missile system. The rocket motor case used in the advanced solid propulsion system is essentially a lightweight shell acted upon by static internal pressure and dynamic and thermal loads during flight, but for practical structural integrity purposes, consideration of internal pressure is all that is necessary. This paper examines existing test data, theories and procedures, frequently used for evaluating the maximum pressure in closed ended cylindrical vessels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Treatment of phenolic and aromatic amino compounds in polluted waters by
   photocatalytical oxidation
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED OXIDATION TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE-WATER; DEGRADATION
AB Improper handling of rocket fuel residues at abandoned military bases has resulted in heavy pollution of the soil and groundwater with aromatic amino compounds. A similar phenomenon is observed with ash dumps in which solid waste from oil shale thermal treatment is disposed: the ash dump leachate is heavily polluted with phenolic. and other compounds, resistant to biological treatment. Experimental research of photocatalytical oxidation (PCO) of both classes of substances and polluted waters was undertaken. The influence of different parameters - pH, concentration of substances to be oxidised, character of substances formed during the PCO, presence of inorganic admixtures, effect of OH.-radical generators and scavengers - on the PCO of solutions of phenolic and aromatic amino compounds was determined. The role of OH.-radicals was found to be important in determining both the PCO rate and the character of the oxidation by-products. The PCO of organic pollutants was also investigated using a catalyst immobilised onto the surface of buoyant hollow glass micro-spheres. Attached titanium dioxide showed lower photocatalytical activity than its slurry, although it allows waters to be treated in simple shallow ponds without intensive stirring. The toxicity of aqueous solutions and polluted waters decreased as PCO proceeded and the biodegradability increased. The energy consumed by PCO of phenolic compounds in phenolic wastewater under solar radiation was estimated to be smaller than the energy consumed by oxidation with ozone.

TI Magnetic field experiment on the SUNSAT satellite
SO JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB On Tuesday 23 February 1999, at 10:29 UTC, SUNSAT was launched into an 857 X 655 km, 96.47degrees polar orbit on a Boeing-Delta 11 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, USA. Both SUNSAT and Orsted were NASA-sponsored secondary payloads accompanying the USA Air Force Argos satellite. In the process it became South Africa's (and Africa's) first satellite in space. Although sponsored by several private industrial organisations, it is essentially a student project with more than 96 graduate students in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Stellenbosch providing the majority of SUNSAT's engineering development and operation since 1992. This paper reports on the magnetic field experiment on board the Sunsat satellite, consisting of two fluxgate magnetometers, called Orimag and Scimag, both built and calibrated by the Hermanus Magnetic Observatory. Orimag is mainly used for orientation control purposes on SUNSAT, while Scimag. mounted on a boom of 2.2 in is designed to perform geomagnetic field observations, employing standard navigation fluxgate technology.

ID CONTAINERLESS SOLIDIFICATION; MICROGRAVITY; PHASE; OXIDE
AB From 1997, the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) metastable research team has studied containerless materials processing to establish undercooled and nucleation processing techniques for oxides and high-melting-temperature metals as a preparation for flying the electrostatic levitation furnace on the International Space Station. This crucible-less facility allows samples to be deeply undercooled while avoiding nucleation on the sample surface. It allows not only precise measurements of the thermophysical properties of molten sample, but also permits material processing from the undercooled state. Of the four levitation techniques (acoustic, electromagnetic, electrostatic, aerodynamic), NASDA has concentrated on the development of an electrostatic levitation system, both for use in the ISS and for fundamental research on the ground. A promising containerless experiment of a ceramic oxide using the electrostatic containerless furnace under the microgravity condition offered by a sounding rocket (TR-IA No. 7) was also carried out in 1998 and is addressed in this paper. A novel aerodynamic levitation system was developed to adopt the drop tube which gave smooth cooling curves for molten Y(3)Al(5)O(12) (YAG) sample. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Design of a fusion propulsion system - Part 1: Gigawatt-level
   magnetoplasmadynamic source
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Optimum travel duration for manned interplanetary missions requires propulsion systems that deliver very high thrust, on the order of a thousand Newtons, in conjunction with specific impulse capabilities that exceed 10,000 s. Theoretically, rocket propellants consisting of fusion reactants intermixed with large masses of low-molecular-weight fuels can be expanded within a magnetic nozzle to meet these requirements. To produce the power levels associated with such systems, a gigawatt pulse line called Godzilla is adapted for experimental development. The megajoule-level energy available is electromagnetically deposited in cold helium gas to simulate the fusion-heated, low-molecular-weight propellant. The magnetohydrodynamic computer code, MACH2, is employed to provide guidelines in the design of this magnetoplasmadynamic plasma source. The numerical results specify the geometric configuration and operation conditions required to overcome destructive effects associated with these power levels within experimental limitations.

CT Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference
CY AUG 06-09, 2001
CL MONTREAL, CANADA
AB Improved methods for base-pressure prediction under base-bleed and rocket motor-on conditions have been deployed. The base bleed method makes several refinements to the method developed by Danberg at the Army Research Laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland. The improved rocket motor-on, base-pressure prediction improves upon the method developed at the Army Missile Command in Huntsville, Alabama, by Brazzel and some of his colleagues. The major refinement to the base bleed method of Danburg was to estimate the power-off value of base pressure empirically based on an extensive database, as opposed to using computational fluid dynamics codes to predict this term. The major modifications to the power-on base-pressure prediction method of Brazzel was to extend its range of applicability to high values of thrust coefficient, to Mach numbers less than 1.5, and to different afterbody shapes. In comparing the improved methods for power-on base-drag prediction to experiment, it was seen that both methods gave reasonable agreement to most experimental databases.

TI Development of an acoustic actuator for launch vehicle noise reduction
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
AB In many active noise control applications, it is necessary that acoustic actuators be mounted in small enclosures due to volume constraints and in order to remain unobtrusive. However. the air spring of the enclosure is detrimental to the low-frequency performance of the actuator. For launch vehicle noise control applications, mass and volume constraints are very limiting, but the low-frequency performance of the actuator is critical. This work presents a novel approach that uses a nonlinear buckling suspension system and partial evacuation of the air within the enclosure to yield a compact, sealed acoustic driver that exhibits a very low natural frequency. Linear models of the device are presented and numerical simulations are given to illustrate the advantages of this design concept.

AB The ethylene-propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber is an important material for rocket engine technology due to its thermal and mechanical characteristics, The improvement of the adhesion characteristics of EPDM on other kinds of polymers, using plasma technology, has been the major subject of many research works carried out during the last years. In this work, the EPDM surface activation process was carried out in a reactive ion etching reactor (RIE) operated at 13,54 MHz using pure oxygen and a gas mixture of argon and oxygen. These essays were performed varying the process pressure from 70 mTorr to 1000 mTorr, process time from 1min to 10min and RF power input from 50W to 200W. The surfaces of the treated samples were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR). The evolution of the C-OH, and C=O and R-0 chemical groups were observed. as a function of the plasma process parameters. The analysis of the IR spectra showed that there are experimental condition of the process in which the production of new radical groups on this rubber surface is maximized.

AB Combustion dynamics constitutes one of the most challenging areas in combustion research. Many facets of this subject have been investigated over the past few decades for their fundamental and practical implications. Substantial progress has been accomplished in understanding, analysis, modeling, and simulation. Detailed laboratory experiments and numerical computations have provided a wealth of information on elementary dynamical processes such as the response of flames to variable strain, vortex rollup, coupling between flames and acoustic modulations, and perturbed flame collisions with boundaries. Much recent work has concerned the mechanisms driving instabilities in premixed combustion and the coupling between pressure waves and combustion with application to the problem of instability in modem low NOx heavy-duty gas turbine combustors. Progress in numerical modeling has allowed simulations of dynamical flames interacting with pressure waves. On this basis, it has been possible to devise predictive methods for instabilities. Important efforts have also been directed at the development of the related subject of combustion control. Research has focused on methods, sensors, actuators, control algorithms, and systems integration. In recent years, scaling from laboratory experiments to practical devices has been achieved with some success, but limitations have also been revealed. Active control of combustion has also evolved in various directions. A number of experiments on laboratory-scale combustors have shown that the amplitude of combustion instabilities. could be reduced by applying control principles. Full-scale terrestrial application to gas turbine systems have allowed an increase of the stability margin of these machines. Feedback principles are also being explored to control the point of operation of combustors and engines. Operating point control has special importance in the gas turbine field since it can be used to avoid operation in unstable regions near the lean blowoff limits. More generally, closed loop feedback concepts are useful if one wishes to improve the combustion process as demonstrated by applications to automotive engines. Many future developments of combustion will use such concepts for tuning, optimization, and emissions reduction. This article proposes a broad survey of these fast-moving areas of research.

AB We report on the first results of NUVIEWS, a sounding rocket experiment designed to map the far-UV background in four narrow UV bands. This is the first imaging measurement of the UV background to cover a substantial fraction of the sky. In our first flight, we mapped one-quarter of the sky with similar to5'-10' imaging resolution. We present a map of the continuum background obtained in the 1740 Angstrom telescope and use a model based upon the multiple scattering approach of Witt, Friedman, & Sasseen and a three-dimensional stellar distribution to constrain the dust and other parameters. We find that the dust in the diffuse interstellar medium displays a moderate albedo (a = 0.45 +/- 0.05) and highly forward scattering phase function parameter (g = 0.77 +/- 0.1) over a large fraction of the sky, similar to the result found for a more restricted area by Witt, Friedman, & Sasseen. We have also discovered a significant variance from the model and shown that it is a natural property of the statistics of clouds with varying multiple scattering geometries. The coverage and quality of our data allows us to place simultaneous constraints on a, g, the extragalactic background (200 +/- 100 CU), a slant cosecant (airglow) contribution (similar to 200 CU), and an instrumental scattering component (40 +/- 30 CU).

TI Assessment of launch vehicle advances to enable human mars excursions

DT Article

   GUIDANCE; DESIGN; SPACECRAFT
AB A mathematical model is developed for the assessment of the launch mass of a vehicle designed for a human mission to Mars. The mission involves six stages: (i) ascent from Earth surface to low Earth orbit, (ii) outgoing trip from low Earth orbit to low Mars orbit., (iii) descent and landing on Mars, (iv) ascent from Mars surface to low Mars orbit, (v) return trip from low Mars orbit to low Earth orbit, (vi) descent and landing on Earth. The basic objective is to minimize the launch mass while containing the total flight time.
   The mathematical model includes two parts: interplanetary flight and planetary flight. The interplanetary flight model is based on the restricted four-body scheme and covers the spacecraft transfer from a low Earth orbit to a low Mars orbit and back. The planetary flight model concerns the spacecraft ascent from Earth surface to low Earth orbit and from Mars surface to low Mars orbit. The sequential gradient-restoration algorithm is employed to solve optimal trajectory problems of interplanetary flight in mathematical programming format and optimal trajectory problems of planetary Right in optimal control format.
   The planetary flight study shows that, due to the large gravitational constant of Earth, it is best to assemble the spacecraft in low Earth orbit and launch it from there, rather than from the Earth surface. To reduce the ratio of outgoing LEO mass to return LEO mass, it is best to design the spacecraft as consisting of three modules: Earth return module, habitation module, Mars excursion module.
   The interplanetary flight study shows that, for minimum energy LEO-LMO-LEO transfer, the total characteristic velocity is 11.30 km/s. The round-trip time is 970 days, including a stay of 454 days on Mars while waiting for an optimal return date. For a fast transfer mission with a stay of 30 days on Mars, the round-trip time can be reduced to less than half at the cost of nearly doubling the characteristic velocity, thereby resulting into a mass ratio 10 times higher than that of a minimum energy mission, if chemical propellants are used.
   To decrease the total mass ratio, use of advanced techniques is indispensable. First, aerobraking techniques can contribute considerably to the reduction of mass ratios: excess velocity on arrival to Mars (outgoing trip) and excess velocity on arrival to Earth (return trip) can be depleted via aerobraking maneuvers instead of propulsive maneuvers. Second, the development of engine/propellant combinations with high specific impulse can be another key factor for reducing the mass ratio. Third, cargo transportation can be used: equipment and propellant not required for the outgoing trip can be sent before the crew leaves Earth via a cargo spacecraft using a low-thrust engine having high specific impulse. Numerical computation shows that, if both aerobraking techniques and cargo transportation techniques are employed, the mass ratio for a minimum energy mission can be brought down by a factor of 5, while the mass ratio for a fast transfer mission can be brought down by a factor of 20.
   To sum up, the mathematical model developed for a launch vehicle can help the engineer to assess proper development directions. Numerical results are highly dependent on certain factors characterizing hardware and propellant such as engine specific impulse, spacecraft structural factor and aerobraking structural factor. At this time, we must look at a round trip Earth-Mars-Earth by humans as a formidable undertaking. This paper merely indicates some useful directions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Because of a lack of spectral resolution in existing spectroscopic data, current white dwarf atmospheric models cannot explain the atmospheric structure, and resultant extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission, of G191-B2B unambiguously. Therefore, a new rocket-borne EUV spectrograph was designed, built, calibrated, and launched. This instrument observed G191-B2B over a bandpass of 254E317 Angstrom and with a resolving power of lambda/Delta lambda approximate to 2800. Highly statistically significant absorption features within the flight spectrum, coupled with metal-rich modeled stellar spectra, provide evidence for blended features of Fe IV / Fe V and Fe IV / O III in G191-B2B's atmosphere. A 3 sigma upper limit of 2 x 10(-5) has been placed on the photospheric helium abundance, arguing against models that rely on He II as a major EUV opacity source.

AB This note is concerned with the H-infinity analysis and synthesis of linear distributed delay systems. An efficient stability and L-2-gain criterion Is established. It is based on a recent approach to the analysis and design of linear time delay systems which represents the system in an equivalent descriptor form. The obtained criterion is used to derive an efficient state-feedback control design which stabilizes the distributed delay system and achieves a guaranteed disturbance attenuation level in spite of a polytopic uncertainty in the system parameters. The new method is applied to the robust stabilization and control of combustion in rocket motor chambers.

TI Electron densities determined by inversion of ultraviolet limb profiles
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS

DT Article
ID SPECTROSCOPY; AIRGLOW; DAYGLOW
AB We present electron density profiles derived by inversion of ultraviolet limb radiances observed on November 24, 1999, by the Low-Resolution Airglow and Aurora Spectrograph instrument on the Advanced Research and Global Observing Satellite. The solar 10.7-cm radio flux was 181 solar flux units, and the daily ap was 21, indicating moderate geomagnetic activity. The O+ density profile, which is approximately equal to the electron density profile in the F region ionosphere, was determined by inverting the limb radiance profile of O I 911-Angstrom emission of atomic oxygen. The 911-Angstrom emission is produced by radiative recombination of O+ ions and electrons. Sounding rocket and satellite measurements of the Earth's extreme ultraviolet dayglow indicated significant contamination in the 900- to 920-Angstrom passband by emissions from atomic, molecular, and ionized nitrogen [Gentieu et al., 1979, 1981; Chakrabarti et al., 1983]. As a result of these observations, the radiative recombination emission was thought to be of little use for ionospheric sensing during the daytime. Feldman et al. [2001] have recently measured spectra in the 905- to 1184-Angstrom passband and show that the contamination at F region altitudes is less than that present in the earlier observations [Gentieu et al., 1979, 1981; Chakrabarti et al., 1983]. We found the contamination of the O I 911-Angstrom emission to be negligible at F region altitudes and have been able to use the 911-Angstrom emission to accurately characterize the ionospheric state. We have compared the peak electron density and peak height determined by inversion of the 911-Angstrom altitude profiles with nearly coincident ionosonde measurements, and we find the measurements from the two techniques to be in good agreement, demonstrating the accuracy of this technique for sensing the ionospheric state.

ID RADIATED SOUND; INTERIOR NOISE
AB This study investigated the feasibility of using active structural acoustic control with monolithic piezoceramic actuators to reduce the low frequency noise transmission through rocket fairings during launch. Closed-loop simulation results are presented using a fully coupled structural acoustic model of a lightly damped composite fairing structure with integrated piezoceramic actuators. Constraints were placed on controller mass and maximum allowable actuator voltage in order to provide a baseline of reasonable expected performance. Realistic disturbance levels were used in the simulations, and two disturbance cases were considered with significantly different spectral characteristics. Simulations were conducted to compare the effects of actuator thickness, covered surface area, and maximum actuator voltage on controller performance and energy requirements. Linear Quadratic Regulator control laws were computed assuming full-state feedback using three design approaches. The results provide significant insight into the noise transmission problem and to the physical dynamics of the control approach. The best-case reduction in the spatially averaged interior acoustic response was determined to be approximately 2.5 dB over the 0-300 Hz bandwidth.

AB Carbon fibre-reinforced advanced composites are being used for a variety of structural applications, because of their useful mechanical properties, including high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance, Thermal curing of composite products results in internal stresses, due to the mismatch of the coefficients of expansion of the tools and the composite products. Because radiation curing can be done at ambient temperatures, the possibility that the residual stresses might be absent, or much lower in the radiation-cured products, originally led to the start of work on radiation curing of advanced composites at AECL's Whiteshell Laboratories in Pinawa, Canada, in 1985. Research work during the last two decades has shown that advanced composites can be radiation-cured with electron beams or gamma radiation. Many of the advantages of radiation curing, as compared to thermal curing, which include curing at ambient temperature, reduced curing time, improved resin stability and reduced volatile emissions, have now been demonstrated. The initial work focussed on electron curing of acrylated epoxy matrices. Since then, procedures have been developed to radiation cure conventional aerospace epoxies, as well. Electron beam cured advanced composites are now being developed for use in the aircraft and aerospace industry, Repair of advanced composite structures is also possible using radiation curing technology. Radiation curing work is continuing at Pinawa and has also been done by Aerospatiale, who have facilities for electron curing composite rocket motor casings and by Chappas and co-workers who have electron cured part of a boat hull. In this paper. the work done on this emerging new technology by the various groups is briefly reviewed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
AB The paper presents the results of the definition studies performed for the European Space Agency (ESA) on system architectures and enabling technologies for "BepiColombo", a Cornerstone class mission to be launched in the 2007-2009 time frame. The scientific mission comprises 1-year observations by a Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), dedicated to remote sensing, and a Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), dedicated to particles and fields, plus short-duration in situ analysis by a Mercury surface element (MSE). A flexible approach to the programme has been developed, comprising two alternative launch scenarios. In the first option (2009), the 2500-kg class satellite composite, including two propulsion modules and three scientific modules, is launched by an Ariane-5. The trajectory design is based on Venus and Mercury gravity assists plus the thrust provided by a Solar Electric Propulsion Module (SEPM), that is jettisoned before being captured into Mercury orbit. Capture and orbit insertion, executed by successive manoeuvres. of a Chemical Propulsion Module (CPM), occur less than 2.5 yr after launch. In the second scenario, the mission is split into two launches of a small launch vehicle. Two 1200-ka class composites are launched either in the same one-month window or at an interval of 1.6 yr. One composite comprises the SEPM, CPM, MMO and MSE and the other comprises duplicate SEPM+CPM and the MPO. The trajectory design follows the same principles as the Ariane-5 mission, with the SEPM thrust reduced by half and cruise duration ranging between 2.3 and 3.5 yr. Whatever be the implementation, the mission is expected to return about 1700 Gbit of scientific data during the one-year observation phase. The crucial aspects of the spacecraft design are associated with, and constrained by, the high-temperature and high-radiation environment. Basic feasibility has been demonstrated by an extensive design and analysis exercise, and the focus of the programme has now moved to a 3-year preparatory programme dedicated for developing the enabling technologies.

TI Microrockets for Smart Dust
SO SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper details the design and fabrication of millimeter-scale solid propellant rockets for one-time deployment of wireless sensor platforms; known as Smart Dust. Each microrocket assembly is an integrated system, incorporating a combustion chamber, composite propellant grain, nozzle, igniter, and thermoelectric power converter. Solid propellant is advantageous for a millimeter-scale single-use device because of its simple implementation, unlike liquid propellants, which require a more elaborate system of pumps and valves. Therefore the total system volume and complexity are minimized.
   One type of combustion chamber was fabricated in silicon; however, thermal losses to the silicon sidewalls during combustion through a 1:5 mm(2) cross section of fuel were too high to reliably maintain a burn. Successful combustion was demonstrated in cylindrical alumina ceramic combustion chambers with thermal conductivities five times lower than silicon and cross sections of 1-8 mm(2). Thrusts of 10-15 mN were measured for ceramic rockets weighing under 1 g, with specific impulses up to 15 s.
   Silicon nozzles integrated with polysilicon microheaters and thermopiles for thermal power conversion were microfabricated in a single process. Fuel ignition by polysilicon microheaters suspended on a low-stress nitride (LSN) membrane was demonstrated. Microheaters require less than 0.5 W of power to ignite a propellant composed primarily of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) with ammonium perchlorate (AP) oxidizer. They are suspended for thermal isolation through bulk post-processing by a. backside deep reactive ion etch (DRIE). The etched hole beneath the igniter area also serves as a nozzle through which high-velocity combustion gases exit the rocket. Thermopiles, which generate voltages proportional to hot and cold junction temperature differentials, have been fabricated in the same process as igniters, and span backside DRIE thermal isolation cavities. Ten junction thermopiles produced a maximum power of 20 muW. With potential temperature differences of hundreds of degrees and a total of 120 thermocouple junctions fabricated on the silicon nozzle chip, hundreds of milliwatts of power could feasibly be produced during the microrocket's flight and used to augment the Smart Dust power supply.

AB This paper deals with the design algorithm of the first-stage attitude control for the M-V launch vehicle, Japan's scientific satellite carrier. The control features enhanced and robust characteristics against a range of uncertainties of the system parameters. To achieve sufficiently robust characteristics, the problem is approached within the framework of the H-infinity mixed sensitivity problem. The emphasis is put on how to apply the robust control theory to a complicated real problem. In the design, the standard process is modified in a special way. The original, unstable plant dynamics are preliminarily stabilized by a direct output feedback prior to using the standard design process. Then the. standard theory is applied to these pre-stabilized plant dynamics to yield control. The final form of the controller is provided by its combination with the pre-specified feedback. This modification of the procedure is prompted by the fact that it is not always effective in unstable systems. Thus, the controller can be derived much more easily. The effectiveness of the design has been filially established by the first ever flight of the vehicle successfully putting the world's first radio astronomy satellite into orbit.

TI Half model restrictions for linear plug nozzle testing
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Linear plug nozzles have been receiving more attention since the development of the single stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle. To clarify the fundamental features of linear plug nozzle flow, experiments have been performed with half models because the design of the plug nozzle is symmetric. Experimental and numerical results are presented to investigate the usefulness of a half model design. The experiments were conducted on a half model without external flow and with an external flow at a Mach number of M(infinity) = 2. The results have been used to validate computations using Navier-Stokes equations provided with a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model and a Degani-Schiff correction. For comparison computations were performed for a full model subjected to the same conditions. For all of these conditions, the effects of increasing or decreasing pressure ratio have been taken into account.

TI Rocket-based combined-cycle engine integration on an osculating cone
   waverider vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB An aerodynamic model for a rocket-based combined-cycle engine-airframe integrated vehicle using an osculating cone waverider forebody is presented. Emphasis is placed on the hypersonic portion of the vehicle trajectory, where scramjet operation occurs. An analytical model for the compression flowfield in the engine is developed, validated, and incorporated into a finite-rate chemistry engine model for hydrogen and air. Issues of off-design Mach number, angle of attack, and performance through a trajectory are addressed for a nonoptimal example vehicle. The results show that the aerodynamic performance of this class of engine-airframe integrated vehicle can be rapidly solved and incorporated into a vehicle design and trajectory code.

ID INTERPLANETARY TRAJECTORIES; MOON TRAJECTORIES; OPTIMIZATION
AB Fuel-optimal three-dimensional trajectories from Earth to Mars for spacecraft powered by a low-thrust rocket with variable specific impulse capability are presented. The problem formulation treats the spacecraft mass as a state variable, thus coupling the spacecraft design to the trajectory optimization. Gravitational effects of the sun, Earth, and Mars are included throughout an entire trajectory. To avoid numerical sensitivity, the trajectory is divided into segments, each defined with respect to a different central body. These segments are patched at intermediate time points, with proper matching conditions on the states and costates. The optimization problem is solved using an indirect multiple shooting method. Details of trajectories for the outbound legs of crewed missions to Mars, with trip times of 145 and 168 days, are shown. Effects due to variations in the trip time, departure and arrival orbit inclinations, initial fuel mass, and power level are investigated.

TI Two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane concept with growth potential
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) spaceplane concept developed in 1993 is revisited, and new information is provided to assist in the development of the next-generation space transportation vehicles. The design philosophy, TSTO spaceplane concept, and the design method are briefly described. A trade study between cold and hot structures leads to the choice of cold structures with external thermal protection systems. The optimal Mach number for staging the second stage of the TSTO spaceplane (with airbreathing propulsion on the first stage) is 10, based on life-cycle cost analysis. Mass properties of four TSTO spaceplanes with a turbo/ram/scramjet propulsion system on the first stage are presented, and the specification and performance of one of these spaceplanes are discussed. Two of these spaceplanes have builtin growth potential, and one of these is proposed as a prototype/experimental TSTO spaceplane to address the near-term access to space needs. The internal rate of return on investment is the highest for the proposed TSTO spaceplane, vis-A-vis a single-stage-to-orbit rocket vehicle and a TSTO spaceplane without builtin growth. Additional growth potentials for the proposed spaceplane are suggested. This spaceplane-can substantially decrease access-to-space cost and risk and increase safety and reliability in the near term. It can be a serious candidate for the next-generation space transportation system.

TI French-Russian partnership on hypersonic wide-range ramjets
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB France and Russia have an ongoing fruitful cooperation to jointly develop a wide-range ramjet (WRR) able to accelerate a reusable launch vehicle from similar to Mach 3 to Mach 12. The WRR engine has a fully variable internal geometry, which enables a high performance level over the whole Mach-number range. Propulsion-oriented system studies have been conducted both on 30-tons-class experimental flight vehicle and on 500 tons-class single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable vehicles. In particular, the WRR airbreathing propulsion system has been integrated into a SSTO generic vehicle. Then, trajectory simulation, using mass, propulsion, and aerodynamic models, has allowed determining the payload as a function of total takeoff weight, confirming the utility of the variable geometry features of the WRR. Preliminary experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for several years to design the WRR prototype. The present contribution describes the synthesis of this engine and provides an overview of this common work. Consideration is given to various aspects of the project, including system studies, technology development, and analyses using contour control codes.

TI Synthesis of a FESTIP airbreathing TSTO space transportation system
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The recent Future European Space Transportation Investigation Program (FESTIP) system study has included one two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) concept with an airbreathing first stage and a rocket-propelled second stage. Because of the pure acceleration mission from Kourou/CSG and the limited technology level that should be applied, turbojet engines for staging at Mach 4 were assumed in the first stage. Two different TSTO configurations were studied in parallel: the fully integrated delta-wing configuration and the less integrated trapezoidal-wing configuration. The predesign activities were completed in July 1998, and a better data basis is now available for comparing the two design options in terms of launcher size, performance, complexity, operations, and cost. In spite of the high aerodynamic integration of the delta-wing configuration, its overall performance is rather limited because of weak turbojet performance at high Mach numbers and altitudes. Inclusion of a ramjet for operation beyond Mach 3 would increase the optimum staging Mach number and overall complexity of this TSTO concept The trapezoidal-wing configuration makes best use of a boost to beyond Mach 1.3 by rocket engines of the second stage, which are fueled during the combined ascent by cross feeding from the first stage. The limited analyses performed on the double-wing aerodynamic interaction between the mated stages has not revealed any severe objections. This TSTO concept has exceeded the current FESTIP performance requirements, delivering 9 Mg into equatorial 250-km-reference orbit and 3 Mg into polar 250-km-reference orbit. With respect to cost, this launcher could be optimized by avoiding any stage integration. Then the internal tank arrangement of the first stage is not penalized by additional geometric constraints, and stage separation becomes simpler. Takeoff mass of the trapezoidal-wing configuration is 470 Mg compared to 430 Mg for the delta-wing configuration. Nevertheless, the vehicle dry mass, which drives development cost, is 40 Mg heavier for the delta-wing configuration. The absolute cost figures of both TSTO options are significantly higher than those of the single-stage-to-orbit vehicles investigated in the FESTIP program.

TI Strutjet engine performance
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB To increase the technology readiness level of hypersonic scramjet technology, an innovative strut-based dual-mode ramjet engine design capable of powering a hypersonic vehicle at speeds from Mach 4 to 8 is investigated. Two versions of the engine are under development: a dual-mode (ramjet/scramjet) engine for missile applications and a rocket-based combined cycle engine for space access. This paper will discuss the features of the dual-mode engine design and how they contribute to overall engine performance. Engine component performance was evaluated using a combination of analysis and component testing. Inlet performance data (mass capture, pressure recovery, and inlet/isolator pressure ratio) were obtained from wind-tunnel testing and correlated with model and full-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. Combustor performance data (combustion efficiency, fuel-injection performance, and pressure distributions) were obtained from full-scale direct-connect combustor testing. Nozzle losses and efficiency were obtained from CFD analysis. Performance parameters derived from these component tests and analyses were fed into a standard hypersonic engine cycle code to predict flight engine performance. The demonstrated component performance values were extrapolated to determine predicted component performance at the end of engine development, which were used to compute the vision flight engine performance.

TI Quasi-one-dimensional high-speed engine model with finite-rate chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The quasi-one-dimensional equations of fluid motion are coupled with the equations for finite-rate chemistry to model high-speed engine flowfields. The model was developed for rapid vehicle design and optimization, where a wide range of engine inlet conditions may be encountered. Incorporating the timescales of fuel mixing and ignition are crucial for accurate prediction of combustor performance, especially for nonhydrogen fuels and off-design conditions (where equilibrium assumptions are invalid). The effects of area change, friction, mass injection, fuel mixing, and heat transfer to the combustor walls are included. The resulting model is compared to experimental results for hydrogen-fueled scramjet engines to demonstrate the ability to predict wall pressure profiles and fuel ignition point. Application to a rocket-based combined-cycle engine and a hydrocarbon scramjet missile engine are discussed. The model presented predicts peak pressure and fuel ignition accurately, as well as flowfield pressures in regions where boundary-layer separation is not present.

AB An overview of the activities associated with the aerodynamic database that is being developed in support of NASA's Hyper-X scramjet flight experiments is provided. Three flight tests are planned as part of the Hyper-X program. Each will utilize a small, non-recoverable research vehicle with an airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion engine. The research vehicles will be individually rocket boosted to the scramjet engine test points at Mach 7 and 10. The research vehicles will then separate from the first stage booster vehicle and the scramjet engine test will be conducted before the terminal decent phase of the flight. An overview is provided of the activities associated with the development of the Hyper-X aerodynamic database, including wind-tunnel test activities and parallel computational fluid dynamics analysis efforts for all phases of the Hyper-X flight tests. A brief summary of the Hyper-X research vehicle aerodynamic characteristics is provided, including the direct and indirect effects of the airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion system operation on the basic airframe stability and control characteristics. Brief comments on the planned postflight data analysis efforts are also included.

The separation of the research vehicle from the Pegasus presents some unique aerodynamic problems, for which computational fluid dynamics has played a role in the analysis. We describe the use of several computational methods for investigating the aerodynamics of the research and launch vehicles in close proximity. Specifically addressed are unsteady effects, aerodynamic database extrapolation, and differences between wind-tunnel and flight environments.

AB The kinetic power and efficiency equations for general jet propulsion systems are classically given in a much cursory, incomplete, and ununified format. This situation prohibits the propulsion designer from seeing the panorama of interrelated propulsion parameters and effects. And in some cases, it may lead to an energy-inefficient propulsion system design, or induce significant offset in propulsion performance as demonstrated in this study. Thus. herein we attempt to clarify sonic related concept and to rigorously derive the associated generalized equations with a complete spectrum of physical parameters to be manipulated in quest of better performance. By a highly efficient interweaved transport scheme, we have derived the following equations for general jet propulsion systems : i.e., generalized total kinetic power, generalized kinetic power delivered to the jet propulsion system, generalized thrust power, generalized available propulsion power, and relevant generalized propulsive, thermal, and overall efficiency equations. Further, the variants of these equations under special conditions are also considered. For taking advantage of the above propulsion theories, we also illustrate some novel propulsion strategies in the final discussion, such as the dive-before-climb launch of rocket from highland mountain on eastbound rail, with perhaps minisatellites as the payloads.

AB Neutral atomic oxygen (AO)-the dominant atmospheric species at typical low Earth orbit altitudes-is responsible for the erosion, or other degradation, of many satellite materials. Therefore, AO has become an important consideration for spacecraft designers and manufacturers. The study of AO is also of interest to atmospheric physicists because it is involved in many of the chemical reactions occurring naturally in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Both these groups rely on atmospheric models for computer-based simulation and prediction of atomic oxygen concentrations. Such models require, or are enhanced by, empirical input data-that is, actual measurements of AO number densities. A review is presented of the different measurement techniques that, to date, have been used on satellites and sounding rockets to perform AO studies. Rather than reporting results from every sensor application, this article takes a more general view of the experimental methods, using example devices to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. New or promising equipment, or techniques that could be exploited for performing such measurements, are also described. We attempt some semiquantitative comparison of the techniques, although the most appropriate experimental method for any given flight opportunity depends heavily on the mission conditions and science goals. Our emphasis is on missions where the available mass and power are limited. In these situations the most suitable established device is probably that of the thin film actinometer. If more risk can be assumed then a more promising, but as yet unqualified, method is that of the fiber-optic reflectance sensor. However, since both these devices are nonreusable, it is shown that semiconducting sensors may be better for long duration, mass- and power-limited applications.

DT Article
AB This article documents recent improvements to the acoustic control system of the Thermal Acoustic Fatigue Apparatus (TAFA), a progressive wave tube test facility at the NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. A brief summary of past acoustic performance is first given to serve as a basis of comparison with the new performance data using a multiple-input, closed-loop, narrow-band controller. Performance data in the form of test section acoustic power spectral densities and coherence are presented for a variety of input spectra including uniform, band-limited random and an expendable launch vehicle payload bay environment.

AB The first stage of the H-2 rocket used a 110-ton thrust liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, pump-fed engine, the LE-7. This engine required high-pressure and high-power liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen turbopumps to achieve the two-stage combustion cycle in which the combustion pressure is around 13 MPa. Furthermore, it was very important to operate both turbopumps at higher rotational speeds to obtain a smaller, lighter-weight engine because the LE-7 had not low-speed, low-pressure pumps ahead of both the main pumps. The present paper shows the design, test results, and modifications that had been performed until a flight-type liquid oxygen turbopump for the LE-7 engine was completed. The liquid oxygen turbopump had been developed by the use of three models, that is, research, prototype, and flight models.

TI M-component mode of charge transfer to ground in lightning discharges
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM TRIP; CONTINUING CURRENT; RETURN STROKES; FIELD
   PULSES; FLASHES; FLORIDA
AB The M-component mode of charge transfer to ground is examined using (1) multiple-station measurements of electric and magnetic fields at distances ranging from 5 to similar to 500 in from triggered-lightning channels and (2) measured currents at the channel base. Data have been obtained in 1997, 1999, and 2000 at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at Camp Blanding, Florida, for (1) "classical" M-components that occur during the continuing currents following return strokes and (2) impulsive processes that occur during the initial stage of rocket-triggered lightning and are similar to the "classical" M components. All lightning events considered here effectively transported negative charge to ground. For one triggered-lightning event the electric field 45 km from the lightning channel was measured together with the current and close fields. The shapes and magnitudes of the measured close electric and magnetic fields are generally consistent with the guided-wave mechanism of the lightning M component. Specifically, the M-component electric field peak exhibits logarithmic distance dependence, ln(kr(-1)), which is indicative of a line charge density that is zero at ground and increases with height. Such a distribution of charge is distinctly different from the more or less uniform charge density that is characteristic of the dart leaders in triggered lightning, as inferred from close electric field measurements. The M-component magnetic field peak decreases as the inverse distance (i.e., r(-1)), which is generally consistent with a uniform current within the lowest kilometer or so of channel. The M-component electric field at 45 km appeared as a bipolar, microsecond-scale pulse that started prior to the onset of the M-component current at the channel base. M-component-type processes can produce acoustic signals with peak pressure values of the same order of magnitude as those from the leader/return stroke sequences in triggered lightning.

AB Rocket engine performance can be modeled by considering separately the propellant delivery system distribution, combustion efficiency including propellant vaporization and gas-phase mixing, and nozzle expansion efficiency. Although these quantities can be modeled, experimental verification is extremely helpful for separately understanding these processes and for design improvements. Laser-induced fluorescence of OH, excited by a KrF excimer laser operating at 248 nm, is used to measure the concentration of the OH radical across the exit plane of a firing Titan IV, stage I, liquid rocket engine, from which the combusting mixture ratio profile could be inferred. These measurements allow assessment of the degree of mixing and potential flow stratification between the injector core, combustion baffles, and combustion chamber fuel-film cooling and can help to provide the basis for future performance optimization.

TI Prediction of mechanical behavior of spatially reinforced composites for

SO COMPOSITE STRUCTURES

DT Article
DE spatially reinforced composites; kick motor nozzle; stiffness prediction
AB This paper predicts the material properties of spatially reinforced composites (SRCs) and analyzes the mechanical behavior of a kick motor nozzle manufactured from that material. To find the appropriate SRC structure for the nozzle throat that satisfies given design conditions, the equivalent material properties of the SRC are predicted using the superposition of rod and matrix stiffnesses. The kick motor nozzle considered in this study consists of graphite or SRC as the throat part, carbon/phenol as the outer surface of the entrance part and inner surface of the expansion part, and steel as the outer surface of the expansion part. The material properties in arbitrary spatial directions are predicted and compared for 3-D and 4-D SRCs suitable to an axisymmetric kick motor nozzle structure. The 4-D SRC shows the smallest and uniform deformation in the nozzle throat, which has a favorable effect on the rocket thrust. The equivalent material properties of SRC are input to analyze the mechanical behavior of the kick motor nozzle using finite element method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a Self-Compensating All-Reflecting Interferometer used to measure diffuse interplanetary H Ly alpha emission (lambda similar to 1216 Angstrom) of interstellar origin at high spectral resolution (lambda/Delta lambda - 100,000). The instrument is capable of resolving the separation between the Doppler-shifted, interplanetary neutral H emission from the Earth's geocoronal emission line. We present the optical layout and mechanical design that enable the instrument to maintain alignment through a sounding rocket flight. We find an H Lya spectrum, including both geocoronal emission and interplanetary scattered features, which we have fitted using Gaussian line profiles. The interplanetary H line is fitted with a 7900 +/- 2400 K line width. The geocoronal line width is fitted with a 1900 +/- 500 K Gaussian. The Doppler shift between the geocoronal and interplanetary line is 0.145 Angstrom, corresponding to an apparent interplanetary wind velocity of 16 +/-7 km. s(-1). We show how full line-profile measurements of interplanetary H emission can advance current studies of the heliospheric interface region and very local interstellar medium.

TI Optimization of the radiation shielding mass for the magnet coils of the

SO ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TOROIDAL FIELD-COILS
AB An attempt has been made for the optimisation of the radiation shielding of a spacecraft design concept with inertial fusion energy propulsion for manned or heavy cargo deep space missions beyond earth orbit. Rocket propulsion is provided by fusion power deposited in the inertial confined fuel pellet debris, and with the help of a magnetic nozzle. The allowable nuclear heating in the super conducting magnet coils (up to 5 mW/cm(3)) is the crucial criterion for the dimensioning of the radiation shielding structure of the spacecraft. The optimized design reduced the shield mass from 600 tons to 93 and 88 tons with natural and enriched lithium, respectively. The space craft mass was 6000 tons. Total peak nuclear power density in the coils is calculated to be 5.0 mW/cm(3) for a fusion power of 17,500 MW. Peak neutron heating density is 2.6 mW/cm(3) and peak gamma -ray heating density is 2.9 mW/cm(3) (all on different points). However, volume averaged heat generation in the coils is much lower, namely 0.30, 0.73 and 1.03 mW/cm(3) for neutron, gamma -ray and total nuclear heating, respectively.

TI Feasibility to control launch vehicle internal acoustics using

AB Future launch vehicle payload fairings will be manufactured from advanced lightweight composite materials. The loss of distributed mass causes a significant increase in the internal acoustic environment, causing a severe threat to the payload. Using piezoelectric (PZT) actuators to control the fairing vibration and the internal acoustic environment has been proposed. To help determine the acoustic control authority of piezoelectric actuators mounted on a rocket fairing, the internal acoustic response created by the actuators needs to be determined. In this work the internal acoustic response of a closed simply-supported (SS) cylinder actuated by PZT actuators is determined using an impedance model for the actuator and boundary element analysis. The experimentally validated model is used to extrapolate results for a SS cylinder that emulates a Minotaur payload fairing. The internal cylinder acoustic levels are investigated for PZT actuation between 35 and 400 Hz. Significant reductions in the structural response due to increased damping do not equate to similar reductions in the acoustic sound pressure levels (SPLs) for the cylinder. The sound levels at the acoustic resonant frequencies are essentially unaffected by the significant increase in structural damping while the acoustic levels at the structural resonant frequencies are mildly reduced. The interior acoustic response of the cylinder is dominated by the acoustic modes and therefore significant reductions in the overall interior acoustic levels will not be achieved if only the structural resonances are controlled. As the actuation frequency is reduced, the number of actuators required to generate acoustic levels commensurate to that found in the fairing increases to impractical values. Below approximately 100 Hz, the current demands reach levels that are extremely difficult to achieve with a practical system. The results of this work imply that PZT actuators do not have the authority to control the payload fairing internal acoustics below similar to100 Hz.

TI Effect of gravity on crystallization in heavy metal fluoride glasses
   processed on the T-33 parabolic flight aircraft
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Heavy metal fluoride (HMF) glasses are prone to micro-crystal formation and resulting optical degradation during their high-temperature processing for fibre drawing. It is believed that the absence of gravity-driven density segregation in microgravity can reduce this undesired micro-crystallization during the processing of HMF glasses. Experiments were conducted on the T-33 parabolic flight aircraft in microgravity and under 2-g acceleration to study the effect of gravity on crystallization in HMF glasses. These preliminary experiments indicated that gravity enhances crystallization in HMF glasses during their processing at 370-400 degreesC. However, these results were not considered conclusive due to the short duration of 20 seconds available on the parabolic flight aircraft. Subsequent ground-based experiments were conducted on the T-33 payload using statistical design of experiments to simultaneously study the effect of glass composition, processing temperature, processing time and mode of heating (continuous or pulsed). These experiments indicated that a continuous processing time of over two minutes at crystallization temperatures is required to observe a statistically significant amount of crystallization in HMF glasses. This established the need for longer duration experiments on the sounding rocket, space shuttle or space station. (C) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

TI Development of a resonance igniter for GO(2)/kerosene ignition
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB (A) resonance ignition system is attractive for rocket engines because of the igniter's simplicity and the possibility of multiple ignitions without additional mechanical complexities. In this work a resonance igniter to produce a torch from burning of gaseous oxygen and liquid kerosene was designed and tested. The oxygen is heated for 0, 1 s in the acoustic resonator cavity, and the ignition occurs instantaneously on kerosene injection. The preliminary tests under ambient conditions demonstrated the igniter's ability to ignite GO(2)/kerosene mixtures over a wide range of pressures and mass flow rates. This opens new possibilities to create a compact and reliable ignition system for restarting rocket engines.

ID DAMAGE-MITIGATING CONTROL; SYSTEMS
AB The conceptual development and a design methodology are presented for life-extending control where the objective is to achieve high performance and structural durability of complex dynamic systems. A life-extending controller is designed for a reusable rocket engine via damage mitigation in both the fuel (H-2) and oxidizer (O-2) turbine blades while satisfying the dynamic performance requirements of the combustion chamber pressure and O-2/H-2 mixture ratio. The design procedure makes use of a combination of linear and nonlinear techniques and also allows adaptation of the life-extending controller module to augment a conventional performance controller of the rocket engine. The nonlinear part of the controller is designed by optimizing selected parameters in a prescribed dynamic structure of damage compensation.

TI Flame-spreading phenomena in fin slots of a solid rocket motor
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Flame-spreading processes in the fin-slot regions of solid-propellant motor grains have the potential to influence the behavior of the overall ignition transient. The research conducted in this investigation is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the flame-spreading processes in rocket motors with aft-end fin slots. Nonintrusive optical diagnostic methods were employed to acquire flame-spreading measurements in the fin-slot region of a subscale rocket motor. Highly nonuniform flame-spreading processes were observed in both the deep and shallow fin regions of the test rig. The average flame-spreading rates in the fin-slot region were found to be two orders of magnitude less than those in the circular port region of a typical rocket motor. The flame-spreading interval was found to correlate well with the local pressurization rates. A higher pressurization rate produces a shorter flame-spreading time interval.

AB Space shuttle solid rocket motor case assembly joints are sealed using conventional O-ring seals that are protected from 5500+degreesF combustion gases by thick layers of insulation and special joint-fill compounds. In the current nozzle-to-case joint design NASA has observed hot gas penetration through defects in the joint-fill compound to the innermost O-ring in one out of seven motors. While not threatening motor safety, evidence of hot gas penetration to the O-rings results in extensive reviews before resuming flight. This paper presents burn-resistance, temperature drop, flow, and resiliency test results for several types of NASA braided carbon fiber thermal barriers that are being implemented in a redesign of the nozzle-to-case joint. In burn-resistance tests the thermal barriers lasted for over six minutes when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch at 5500 degreesF. Temperature drops of 2500 to 2800 degreesF were measured through the diameter of the thermal barrier in a compressed state when subjected to an oxyacetylene torch flame. Gas temperatures 1/4 in. downstream of the thermal barrier were within the downstream O-ring temperature limit of 600 degreesE. In subscale rocket "char" motor tests the thermal barrier reduced the incoming 3200 degreesF hot gas by 2200 degreesF, spread the incoming jet flow, and blocked hot slag, thereby protecting the downstream O-rings.

TI Magnetohydrodynamics energy bypass scramjet performance with real gas
   effects
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The theoretical performance of a scramjet propulsion system incorporating a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy bypass scheme is calculated. The one-dimensional analysis developed earlier, in which the theoretical performance is calculated neglecting skin friction and using a sudden-freezing approximation for the nozzle flow, is modified to incorporate the method of Van Driest for turbulent skin friction and a finite-rate chemistry calculation in the nozzle. Unlike in the earlier design, in which four ramp compressions occurred in the pitch plane, in the present design the first two ramp compressions occur in the pitch plane, and the next two compressions occur in the yaw plane. The results for the simplified design of a spaceliner show that 1) skin friction substantially reduces thrust and specific impulse and 2) the specific impulse of the MHD-bypass system is still better than the non-MHD system and typical rocket over a range of flight speeds and design parameters. Results suggest that the energy management with MHD principles offers the possibility of improving the performance of the scramjet for the spaceliner application and for the globecruiser application. The technical issues needing further studies are identified.

TI X-33 experimental aeroheating at Mach 6 using phosphor thermography
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

ID SHUTTLE
AB The goal of the NASA reusable launch vehicle technology program is to mature and demonstrate essential, cost-effective technologies for next-generation launch systems. The X-33 flight vehicle presently being developed by Lockheed Martin is an experimental single-stage-to-orbit demonstrator that seeks to validate critical technologies and ensure applicability to a full-scale reusable launch vehicle. As with the design of any hypersonic vehicle, the aeroheating environment is an important issue, and one of the key technologies being demonstrated on X-33 is an advanced metallic thermal protection system. As part of the development of this thermal protection system, the X-33 aeroheating environment is being defined through conceptual analysis, ground-based testing, and computational fluid dynamics. An overview of the hypersonic aeroheating wind-tunnel program conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center in support of the ground-based testing activities is provided. Global surface heat transfer images, surface streamline patterns, and shock shapes were measured on 0.013 scale (10-in.) ceramic models of the proposed X-33 configuration in Mach 6 air. The test parametrics include angles of attack from -5 to 40 deg, unit Reynolds numbers from I x 10(6) to 8 x 10(6)/ft, and body-flap deflections of 0, 10, and 20 deg. Experimental and computational results indicate the presence of shock/shock interactions that produced localized heating on the deflected flaps and boundary-layer transition on the canted fins. Comparisons of the experimental data to laminar and turbulent predictions were performed. Laminar windward heating data from the wind tunnel was extrapolated to flight surface temperatures and generally compared to within 50 degreesF of flight prediction along the centerline. When coupled with the phosphor technique, this rapid extrapolation method would serve as an invaluable thermal protection system design tool.

TI X-33 hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, under a cooperative agreement with NASA, will design, build, and fly the X-33, a half-scale prototype of a rocket-based, single-stage-to-orbit, reusable launch vehicle. A 0.007-scale model of the X-33 604B0002G configuration was tested in five supersonic/hypersonic facilities at the NASA Langley Research Center to examine vehicle aerodynamic characteristics and to establish the aerodynamic flight database for the hypersonic regime. Effects of Mach number and specific heat ratio on hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics were also studied. These results were complemented with computational aerodynamic data, experimental configuration buildup information, and various types of surface and flowfield visualizations to enhance the understanding of experimentally observed aerodynamic trends. Data at both Mach 6 and Mach 10 show the baseline configuration achieves a maximum hypersonic LID of approximately 1.2 between 20 and 30 deg angle of attack. With the center-of-gravity location at 66% of vehicle reference length, the configuration was found to be longitudinally controllable with less than half of the total body flap deflection capability across the angle of attack range at both Mach 6 and Mach 10. The vehicle also was shown to be longitudinally stable or neutrally stable for typical (greater than 20 deg) hypersonic flight attitudes. At Mach 6 and Mach 10, the baseline configuration demonstrated positive dihedral effect (roll stability) but was directionally unstable. Effects of Mach number on longitudinal aerodynamics were shown to be small relative to X-33 control authority. Effects of specific heat ratio on vehicle pitching moment characteristics were shown to be significant at higher angles of attack, but with a maximum flight Mach number of approximately 10, real-gas phenomena are not expected to occur for the X-33's suborbital flights.

TI Comparative analysis of current NASA human Mars Mission architectures
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB The human Mars Mission architectures recently under study are compared. The evolution of mission modes utilizing indigenous resources for propellant production is described. A historical summary of human Mars architecture design is given as a way of introducing some of the challenges inherent to mission planning. A Mars architecture option based on minimum development costs and risks, rather than minimized mass in low Earth orbit, is presented. A multiyear Mars vehicle set, characterized by chemical propulsion transfer stages (with aero-capture for Mars orbit capture) is described. It is maintained that, for the current Mars Design Reference Mission, the development of more costly advanced propulsion technologies (such as nuclear thermal propulsion, nuclear electric propulsion, or solar electric propulsion) can be considered as later, evolutionary steps from this initial, less costly, all-chemical approach. Emphasis is given to the minimization of new technology development programs and the associated impacts on total Mars mission costs. Analysis is based on the availability of an 80-metric-ton-payload-class launch vehicle. An important ground rule is the preclusion of on-orbit assembly, allowing only for the joining of complete and fully fueled transfer stages in orbit.

AB Ultrasonic tomographic imaging has been performed on a highly attenuating, filled, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, cast into a steel case. The detection of defects and the characterization of solid rocket propellant were thus possible. Extremely low signal levels due to the attenuation and scattering properties of the polymer were present. In addition, a nonideal tomographic reconstruction geometry was present, because of a cylindrical air-filled cavity in the center of the polymer. Complications also arose from high-amplitude guided waves within the steel case, which tended to mask directly transmitted signals through the propellant. These problems were solved using specially designed transducers and pulse-compression signal processing techniques. Modifications to the filtered back-projection reconstruction procedure were made to account for the discontinuity caused by the hole. Images are presented showing the detection of an artificial defect to demonstrate the technique.

AB We present an atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe with integrated piezoresistive read-out. The probe consists of a micromachined cantilever with a tip at the end. The cantilever is a multilayer structure with its thickness defined by etch-stop and the bending controlled by fitting the thicknesses of the thin films constituting the cantilever. The AFM probe has an integrated tip made of a thick sputtered silicon layer, which is deposited after the probe has been defined and just before the cantilevers are released. The tips are so-called rocket tips made by reactive ion etching. We present probes with polysilicon resistors for demonstrating the fabrication principle. The probes have been characterised with respect to noise and deflection sensitivity and have been applied in AFM imaging. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fueled by initial space shuttle results, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been supporting fundamental studies of macromolecular crystal growth since 1985. The majority of this research is directed at understanding the relationship between experimental variables and important crystal characteristics. The program has resulted in new methods and technology that will benefit the crystallography community's effort to meet the ever-increasing demand for protein structural information. Microgravity crystallization results indicate a potential impact on structural biology's more challenging problems, as soon as long-duration experiments can be performed on the International Space Station.

ID STEADY-STATE FLAMES; LAMINAR
AB The paper describes a quasi-one-dimensional model of combustion of sandwich heterogeneous solid rocket propellant designed to predict the burnup rate of individual components (oxidizer and binder) and the average mass rate of combustion of the entire propellant. This model includes the heat- and mass-transfer and kinetic-gasdynamic processes in the gas phase above the surface of burning solid propellant, as well as the heat-transfer processes in solid material. Included in the calculations are the thermochemical properties of ammonium perchlorate (AP, oxidizer) and of polybutadiene rubber (PBR, fuel). The thermochemical processes are included in the kinetic scheme of two overall chemical reactions involving five effective chemical components. Systematic calculations are performed of the process of solid fuel combustion with different mass ratios of oxidizer to fuel. It is demonstrated that the employed kinetic model of thermochemical processes provides an adequate description of the available experimental data on the rate of combustion of AP- and PBR-based solid propellants.

AB The concept and a design methodology for robust damage-mitigating control (DMC) of aircraft is presented. The goal of DMC is to simultaneously achieve high performance and structural durability and the design procedure is based on damage mitigation at critical structures and retention of the flight performance. An aeroelastic model of the wings has been formulated and is incorporated into a nonlinear rigid-body model of aircraft flight-dynamics. Robust damage-mitigating controllers are then designed using the H-infinity-based structured singular value (mu) synthesis method based on a linearized model of the aircraft. In addition to penalizing the error between the ideal performance and the actual performance of the aircraft, frequency-dependent weights are placed on the strain amplitude at the root of each wing. Using each controller in turn, the control system is put through an identical sequence of maneuvers, and the resulting (varying amplitude cyclic) stress profiles are analyzed using a fatigue crack growth model that incorporates the effects of varying-amplitude cyclic loading. Comparisons are made to determine the impact of different strain-amplitude weights on the resulting flight performance and fatigue crack damage in the wings. The results of simulation experiments show significant savings in fatigue life of the wings while retaining the dynamic performance of the aircraft.

AB A fundamental challenge of Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (TBMD) design is to provide the weapon system with the capability of identifying the lethal object, usually a reentry vehicle (RV), from within the complex of objects associated with a ballistic missile flight. The threat complex can contain several individual large objects in addition to the RV. These might include a spent booster, an attitude control device, or both. If the threat has a solid-fuel rocket motor, numerous pieces of hot fuel debris may also be present. The potential number of such fragments is high enough to warrant concern about both the: processing resources and the time required to sort through the debris. Thus, use of an efficient means to cull fuel debris measurements is desirable. An algorithm performing this function would reside in the signal processing chain prior to the target selection logic. Its goal would be to pare down the number of candidate lethal objects, thereby reducing the target selection task. Irradiance observations provided by an onboard infrared seeker operating simultaneously in two distinct wavelength regimes can be utilized to efficiently perform this function.

AB The development of high-aspect-ratio, high-precision micromachining in silicon or silicon carbide suggests the feasibility of microfabricated, high-chamber-pressure chemical rocket engines. With high-speed turbopumps and valves incorporated onto the rocket chip, a number of propulsion cycles are possible, Such an engine, approximately 20 x 15 x 3 mm in size, operating at a 125-atm chamber pressure, would produce about 15 N of thrust using 300-s I-sp propellants at a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1000:1, The feasibility of these engines has been investigated, and a liquid-cooled, pressure-fed thrust chamber and nozzle have been successfully designed, fabricated, and operated at a 12.5-atm chamber pressure to further evaluate the concept.

AB Understanding the fundamentals of high-pressure, high-temperature combustion of practical rocket propellants is key to improving rocket engine performance and efficiency. The application of Raman spectroscopy for making detailed species concentration measurements of oxygen, hydrogen, and water vapor in the elevated-pressure, combusting flowfield downstream of a liquid-oxygen/gaseous-hydrogen swirl-coaxial injector element at fuel-rich conditions is presented. Details regarding measurement error analysis and recommendations fur further refinement of the diagnostic technique are also presented. To the authors' knowledge, these experiments represent the first time that instantaneous temperature and major species profiles have been successfully made in such an environment. These results, which include both instantaneous and time-averaged temperature and species concentration profiles, impact both rocket fuel preburner design and computational fluid dynamic code validation activities.

AB The mixing and combustion processes in a liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen rocket combustor were studied, The research focused on observations of atomization phenomena during steady-state combustion and ignition transients of a rocket engine. Cold-flow atomization as encountered before ignition has been studied using liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and simulation fluids liquid nitrogen/helium. The theoretical assessments show that for binary- and multicomponent systems a transcritical region exists where surface tension is present even at pressures above the critical pressure of one component as long as the critical mixing temperature is not exceeded. Also, hot-fire tests utilizing liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen demonstrate the strong influence of the dame on the atomization process. The dame propagation during ignition could be identified by the change of the atomization phenomenology before and during the ignition process.

AB Plug nozzles are usually designed to achieve altitude adaptation in a wide range of chamber/ambient pressure ratios. In actual in-Right operations of plug nozzles, this phenomenon must take place in a Rowing airstream, which can affect the performance, To understand the how behavior in such conditions and to evaluate the departure from the ideal nozzle performance, an investigation is carried out with a validated numerical tool based on the solution of turbulent Navier-Stokes equations and on shock fitting. A sample rocket plug nozzle is analyzed parametrically to evaluate the effect of varying Mach number at constant pressure and the effect of varying pressure ratio at constant Mach number. The results indicate that the interaction with a flowing airstream reduces the pressure of the external air, as seen from the nozzle exhaust jet, yielding a reduction of the performance. In particular, a dramatic decrease of nozzle performance may take place in the transonic region if the slipstream effect is neglected in the design, The results also provide useful indications on how the Mach number and the shroud shape can affect the value of ambient pressure where the transition from open to closed wake takes place.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Tradeoffs involved in the design of a hydrocarbon-fueled, hypersonic waverider-based missile were explored. The problem of providing acceptable vehicle performance in a volume-constrained package was addressed. The specific case of a missile constrained to fit within a 0.61 x 0.61 x 4.27 in naval vertical launch tube was examined, and a parametric study was performed to determine the probabilistic boundaries of designing a Mach 6 missile to satisfy the desired mission goal of a 750-km cruising range. All missile designs were assumed to reach cruising altitude and velocity through the use of an external rocket booster. The key design elements investigated are fuel volume fraction, engine inlet pressure, the number of scramjet engines, and the effects of changing the engine mixing and burning efficiencies. Missile designs were optimized for steady-state trim conditions at the beginning of cruise using genetic algorithm software. The sensitivities of the modeling assumptions on the performance of the final optimized designs are explained. The overall contribution of the optimized designs along with the predicted change in performance expected with increased modeling accuracy allows upper performance and range limits to be established. Double-engine designs are shown to be more promising than single-engine designs for achieving the desired 750-km range, as well as allowing for increased payload.

AB Progress in the understanding of early mammalian embryo development has been severely hampered by scarcity of study materials. To circumvent such a constraint, we have developed a strategy that involves a combination of in silico mining of new genes from expressed sequence tags (EST) databases and rapid determination of expression profiles of the dbEST-derived genes using a PCR-based assay and a panel of cDNA libraries derived from different developmental stages and somatic tissues. We demonstrate that in a random sample of 49 independent dbEST-derived zinc finger protein genes mined from a mouse embryonic 2-cell cDNA library, more than three-quarters of these genes are novel. Examination of characteristics of the human orthologues derived from these mouse genes reveals that many of them are associated with human malignancies. Expression studies have further led to the identification of three novel genes that are exclusively expressed in mouse embryos before or up to the 8-cell stage. Two of the genes, designated 2czf45 and 2czf48 (2czf for 2-cell zinc finger), are zinc finger protein genes coding for a RBCC protein with a RFP domain and a protein with three C2H2 fingers, respectively. The third gene, designated 2cpoz56, codes for a protein with a POZ domain that is often associated with zinc finger proteins. These three genes are candidate genes for regulatory or other functions in early embryogenesis. The strategy described in this report should generally be applicable to rapid and large-scale mining of other classes of rare genes involved in other biological and pathological processes.

AB We simulate accumulation of Al2O3 particles in the atmosphere produced by solid-fueled rocket motors by using the Goddard Institute for Space Studies/University of California at Irvine three-dimensional (3-D) chemistry-transport model (CTM). Our study differs from Jackman et al. (1998) by applying a 3-D CTM, considering 13 size bins for the emitted particles from 0.025 to 10 mum and taking into account their washout, gravitational sedimentation, and coagulation with background sulfate aerosol. We assume an initial trimodal size distribution of Al2O3 particles (Beiting, 1997) with 2.8% by mass of the alumina emitted as particles with radius of less than 1 mum. Our test case adopts a stratospheric source of 1120 tons/yr equivalent to nine space Shuttle and four Titan IV launches annually. The calculated steady state surface area density (SAD) and mass density for the scenarios with sedimentation of alumina particles have maximum values in the lower stratosphere in the Northern Hemisphere of up to 7x10(-4) mum(2)/cm(3) and 0.09 ng/m(3), respectively, or about 1000 times smaller than those of the background sulfate aerosol. Our results are sensitive to the emitted mass fractionation of alumina (EMFA) showing the values for the SAD or mass density higher or lower by an order of magnitude owing to a poorly known EMFA. Chemical implications of alumina particle accumulation for the ozone balance are estimated by using the Atmospheric and Environmental Research 2-D model assuming chlorine activation on Al2O3 surfaces via the ClONO2 + HCl --> Cl-2 + HNO3 reaction with a probability of 0.02 (Molina et al., 1997). Owing to the very small Al2O3 SAD, any additional ozone depletion due to Al2O3 emissions is also small (0.0028% on a global annually averaged basis for the scenario with sedimentation, or about 4 times smaller than the ozone response to chlorine emissions only). The ozone depletion potential of the alumina emissions is about 0.03-0.08 for the scenarios using the EMFA of Beiting (1997) and larger by an order of magnitude for the EMFA of Brady and Martin (1995).

AB The goal of life extending control (LEC) is to enhance structural durability of complex mechanical systems, such as aircraft, spacecraft, and energy conversion devices, without incurring any significant loss of performance. This paper presents a concept of robust life-extending controller design for reusable rocket engines, similar to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), via damage mitigation in both fuel and oxidiser turbines: while achieving the required performance for transient responses of the main combustion chamber pressure and the oxidant/fuel mixture ratio. The design procedure makes use of a combination of linear robust control synthesis and nonlinear optimisation techniques. Results of simulation experiments on the model of a reusable rocket engine are presented to this effect.

AB The considerations made in the design of a flame deflector for the launch pad of the Brazilian satellite launch vehicle (VLS) are presented. Its main requirements and design criterion are discussed. A post-flight analysis is presented based on local inspection of the launch pad as well as photographs taken during liftoff, showing that the main requirements have been satisfied. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of the flow field is also presented. A solution of the Navier-Stokes equations was obtained by applying an implicit finite volume algorithm. The numerical results allowed a detailed description of the flow field, and its results compared well with the observed features of the flow. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sounding rockets are essential tools for studies of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, in situ measurements from rockets are potentially subject to a number of perturbations related to the gas flow around the vehicle. This paper reviews the aerodynamic principles behind these perturbations. With respect to both data analysis and experiment design, there is a substantial need for improved understanding of aerodynamic effects. Any such analysis is complicated by the different flow regimes experienced during a rocket flight through the rarefied environment of the mesosphere and thermosphere. Numerical studies are presented using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach, which is based on a tracing of individual molecules. Complementary experiments have been performed in a low-density wind tunnel. These experiments are crucial for the development of appropriate model parameterization. How ever, direct similarity between scaled wind tunnel results and arbitrary atmospheric flight conditions is usually difficult to achieve. Density, velocity, and temperature results are presented for different payload geometries and flow conditions. These illustrate a wide range of aerodynamic effects representative for rocket flights in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.

AB This paper proposes operational frameworks for structuring product development processes. The primary objective of this research is to develop procedures to minimize iterations during the development process which adversely affect development time and costs. Several procedures are introduced to restructure the development process. The computation of the corresponding product development times is facilitated by two Markov models addressing different types of learning. The methodologies are employed to identify a set of managerial concerns in restructuring the product development processes.
   The developed framework has become an integral part of a re-engineering project for the development of rocket engines at Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International. Throughout the paper, the methodologies are illustrated with the help of this process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced launch systems studies are ongoing at MAN Technologie AG, Karlsfeld, Germany, contributing to a broader European effort that is examining options for the next space transportation system to be developed there. One promising candidate that uses medium-term technologies is a vertical takeoff semireusalale launch vehicle featuring a reusable booster and an expendable core stage. The dedicated design of fully cryogenic stages enables the launch vehicle concept to bring up to geostationary transfer orbit a payload mass of up to 10 Mg and a low-Earth-orbit mass of 20 Mg. The total liftoff mass is about 520 Mg. This launch vehicle concept proposal could culminate in a fully reusable launch vehicle, a booster and an orbiter stage, for Europe in the long term. The status of the studied launch vehicle concept is summarized. The design features and trade topics leading to the semireusable launch vehicle concept are shown. The selected semireusable launch vehicle is presented as a viable interim step between existing expendable launch vehicles and fully reusable launch vehicles.

AB The vibration control of the apparatus cabin of CZ-3A launch vehicle is investigated. A kind of bar-type viscoelastic damper is designed to control passively the low-frequency vibrations of the whole cabin structure. Three strategies are employed to control the high-frequency vibrations of the honeycomb plate at different frequencies: passive control with the constrained damping layer, integrated control combining the constrained damping layer with the piezoelectric actuator designed by authors, and controllable constrained damping layer, respectively. The experimental results show that the present integrated techniques can effectively suppress the vibrations of the apparatus cabin within a fairly broad frequency band.

AB As it matures in the research laboratory as a tool for the combinatorial chemist, automation is now moving into the development area, However, the classical combinatorial robot is not appropriate for all development activities, as it is primarily a serial device and lacks on-line analysis-often a key requirement for high-speed development. Automation equipment is becoming commercially available to cover all three development stages-route scouting, process optimisation, and final process definition-but it is often highly specific, expensive, complex and may not offer a complete solution, In contrast, standard laboratory equipment already contains some automated capabilities but is normally unused in our automation strategies. This presentation will discuss issues related to a stepwise and unified approach to automation across all three stages, using existing standard laboratory equipment, Examples from diverse areas including calorimetry, DoE, crystallisation studies, and plant simulation will be discussed along with equipment and computer issues. Inexpensive commercial software is now available to control these systems, or software can be developed using modern visual development environments. This is not rocket science-you have the technology!

AB The launching of a waterjet rocket has been a very popular idea in recent years. Its basic propulsion principle makes use of the high-pressurized air inside the rocket's main body to swiftly expel the water out of the nozzle and thus generate thrust. The waterjet rocket is characterized with nature, interest, combustionlessness, environmental friendliness, simplicity, and minimal cost. Moreover, it is a very good science model for propulsion analysis, design, experiment, and education because of an abundance of easily adjustable key parameters. This model also features separately stored energy and mass of the propellant, in contrast to a conventional rocket. However, related literature shows that no in-depth theoretical analysis of the waterjet rocket has been attempted for various reasons. In this research, the propulsion dynamics of a waterjet rocket is analyzed by simultaneously solving the momentum and the newly derived generalized power equations to predict its flight histogram, computationally, and convolutionally. This integrated energy approach synthesizes the internal and external dynamics analyses together and ingeniously takes full advantage of the clear power supply of pressurized air in a waterjet rocket. The analysis results are generally agreeable with the: experimental flight data. While the new power equation herein gives a complete spectrum of physical parameters to be manipulated, there will be wider room in quest of better rocket propulsion performance, especially through the heuristic research of this versatile but affordable waterjet rocket.

TI Microsatellites: An enabling technology for government and commercial
   aerospace applications
SO JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST

DT Article
ID ON-BOARD TECHNOLOGY
AB The ongoing development of a three-axis stabilized microsatellite bus concept designed for critical, embedded government or commercial aerospace applications at APL is described. These microsatellites can form the basis for cost-effective, multiple in situ or remote sensing missions for monitoring physical phenomena; for missions enabled via flying a number of satellites in formation; and for a constellation of satellites launched by a low-cost launch vehicle. The foundation fur this microsatellite bus concept, with a weight of 30 kg and size of 20 x 20 x 61 cm, is based on technologies and manufacturing processes now in place or being developed at APL. The microsatellite and its foundational technologies are being advanced for insertion into current and future APL Space Department proposals and programs and are also candidates for technology transfer to industry for commercial applications.

TI Thermophysics characterization of kerosene combustion
SO JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER
LA English
DT Article
ID OXIDATION; MODEL
AB A one-formula surrogate fuel formulation and its quasi-global combustion kinetics model are developed to support the design of injectors and thrust chambers of kerosene-fueled rocket engines. This surrogate fuel model depicts a fuel blend that properly represents the general physical and chemical properties of kerosene. The accompanying gaseous-phase thermodynamics of the surrogate fuel is anchored with the heat of formation of kerosene and verified by comparing a series of one-dimensional rocket thrust chamber calculations. The quasi-global combustion kinetics model consists of several global steps for parent fuel decomposition, soot formation, and soot oxidation and a detailed wet-CO mechanism to complete the combustion process. The final thermophysics formulations are incorporated with a computational fluid dynamics model for prediction of the combustion efficiency of an unielement, tripropellant combustor and the radiation of a kerosene-fueled thruster plume. The model predictions agreed reasonably well with those of the tests.

AB From a tribological point of view, the selection of materials for seals for valves of cryogenic rocket engines is a critical issue for the designer. Due to the lack of comprehensive information on this topic. data have been obtained in the framework of research programmes.
   In the first step, two polymers potentially usable for sealing cryogenic fluids were identified, They were submitted to general test conditions to gain some fundamental understanding of their tribological behaviour when immersed in a cryogenic fluid. This fundamental understanding proved to be helpful for an efficient technical approach.
   This approach with the test conditions as close as possible to those met in real valves has been used in the second step. In order to obtain the best information with the minimum number of tests, the statistical method of Doehlert has been adopted. The use of such a method led to the construction of surface response for modelling friction and wear. These surfaces and their associated equation are directly and easily usable by the designer, This way of treating technical tribological problem is illustrated by an example.

AB Twenty three (23) years have passed since the research and development of Japan's first LOX/LH2 propulsion system began for the H-I rocket, and 14 years have passed since the successful maiden flight of the H-I rocket. The outcome of LOX/LH2 propulsion technology from the H-I rocket provided the basis for both the first stage and the second stage of the H-ll rocket. After the successful maiden flight of the H-II rocket in 1994, the next five H-II rockets launched eight payloads into GEO, LEO and SSO. However, the last two H-II rockets failed to deliver payloads to orbit. The last failure (H-II rocket No. 8) was due to the early cutoff of the first stage main engine, the LE-7. The H-II rocket No.8 was called the improved version of the H-II rocket or the transition vehicle From the H-I to H-IIA because it utilized the newly developed second stage for the H-IIA and the conventional first stage of the H-II.
   Subsequent to the failure, extensive investigations were undertaken, including search and recovery of the failed LE-7 engine from the seabed about 3000m deep. Also, non-destructive and destructive tests of the engine were performed as well as other investigative tests. Since space transportation is the most essential element of NASDA's space activities, NASDA decided to abandon the last H-LI rocket No.7 development and to give the highest priority to the development of the H-IIA. This paper traces the design of the H-II and H-IIA rockets. Also, this paper shows the lessons learned from the H-II No.8 failure by discussing the technically interesting issues obtained from the failure investigation. Finally, enhancements that will be introduced to the H-IIA project that will secure upcoming space missions in the new century are presented, and the status of the development tests is summarized in this paper.

CT 51st International Astronautical Federation Congress
CY OCT 02-06, 2000
CL RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL
AB Perhaps the most substantial single obstacle to progress of space exploration and utilization of space for human benefit is the safety & reliability and the inherent cost of launching to, and returning from, space. The primary influence in the high costs of current launch systems (the same is true for commercial and military aircraft and most other reusable systems) is the operations, maintenance and infrastructure portion of the program's total life cycle costs. Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) maintenance and design have traditionally been two separate engineering disciplines with often conflicting objectives - maximizing ease of maintenance versus optimizing performance, size and cost. Testability analysis, an element of Informed Maintenance (IM), has been an ad hoc, manual effort, in which maintenance engineers attempt to identify an efficient method of troubleshooting for the given product, with little or no control over product design. Therefore, testability deficiencies in the design cannot be rectified. It is now widely recognized that IM must be engineered into the product at the design stage itself, so that an optimal compromise is achieved between system maintainability and performance.
   The elements of IM include testability analysis, diagnostics/prognostics, automated maintenance scheduling, automated logistics coordination, paperless documentation and data mining. IM derives its heritage from complimentary NASA science, space and aeronautic enterprises such as the on-board autonomous Remote Agent Architecture recently flown on NASA's Deep Space 1 Probe as well as commercial industries that employ quick turnaround operations. Commercial technologies and processes supporting NASA's IM initiatives include condition based maintenance technologies from Boeing's Commercial 777 Aircraft and Lockheed-Martin's F-22 Fighter, automotive computer diagnostics and autonomous controllers that enable 100,000 mile maintenance free operations, and locomotive monitoring system software.
   This paper will summarize NASA's long-term strategy, development, and implementation plans for Informed Maintenance for next generation RLVs. This will be done through a convergence into a single IM vision the work being performed throughout NASA, industry and academia. Additionally, a current status of IM development throughout NASA programs such as the Space Shuttle, X-33, X-34 and X-37 will be provided and will conclude with an overview of near-term work that is being initiated in FY00 to support NASA's 2(nd) Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle Program.

AB Started 16 years ago, the ESEME program has led to a number of important findings. We note a simple and unified view of phase transitions, which has been applied to the development of biological patterns, and a very fast thermalization mode that we coined the ''piston effect". This effect has been applied to control the cryogenic reservoirs of the Ariane 5 rocket. AH these findings have been obtained thanks to the good coordination of the ESA and CNES space facilities and the construction of high technology experimental modules. The future of the program is linked to the CNES DECLIC facility and the ESA Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL). DECLIC has been designed to increase the temperature regulation above the critical point of water (550 K) so as to investigate chemical reactions under conditions of supercritical water, and in relation to the promising applications of waste treatment by supercritical oxidation. Thanks to the construction of a special vibrational Experiment Contains for FSL, the thermal and mechanical behavior of fluids under forced vibration can be investigated The results of such studies will help to estimate the effect of g-jitter on fluids, and control gases and liquids' in space.

AB Our laboratory is proceeding with a project to design and fabricate a nano satellite named "Gekkabijin" as "CanSat" project. This project was agreed at USSS'98 as a Japan-U.S. joint venture to make satellites for educational purpose. CanSat is, as can be imaged from the name, a Coke can shaped and sized satellite. Our CanSat "Gekkabijin" was designed to deploy a thin flexible membrane using centrifugal force. Before we can launch a CanSat into space, we had a chance to put it into sub-orbit with a support from a U.S. amateur rocket group in the name of ARLISS Project. ARLISS Project has already taken place twice in 1999 and 2000 and we carried out 6 missions. This paper describes title objectives, satellite design, experiment results and lessons learned of University of Tokyo CanSat Project. (C) 2001 International Astronautical Federation.

AB The U.S. Congress has maintained an intense interest in the ISS program since its inception. In the Appropriations Act of 1997, the Senate of the United States included language directing National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to have the National Research Council (NRC) under take a study that evaluates the engineering challenges posed by extravehicular activity (EVA) requirements, United States and non-United States space launch requirements, the potential need to upgrade or replace equipment and components after Assembly Complete, and the requirement to decommission and disassemble the facility.
   NASA and the NRC decided the focus should be on the anticipated challenges in the continuous operation and maintenance of the ISS after assembly of the on-orbit facility has been completed. This would encompass the operational years, from late 2004 (if the current schedule holds) to 2020 - 2025.
   This executive summary overviews the results of this NRC study. It focuses on the U.S. operation of the ISS after Assembly Complete, including cooperative efforts by the United States and Russia. The paper summarizes the primary findings and recommendations in each of the areas considered during this two-year NRC study. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Tsiolkovsky etc. pioneers of rocket propulsion); on the eve of launching of the artificial satellite of Earth (A. Blagonravov); after manned flight of Yu. Gagarin (V. Gluchko); after manned flight on Moon (" The Forecasts on 2001 " on materials of readings R. Goddard in USA); in middle of 70-s' years (D. Sevruk, V. Prisniakov) and at the end of 20 centure. Last years under the initiative R. Beichel and M. Pouliquen IAA.Advanced Propulsion Working Group carries out large researches on definition of the tendencies of development of rocket propulsion for the next forty years, the outcomes which one will be used in the report. The comparison of development of rocket propulsion expected to the end of 20 century and real-life is given. The report analyses the errors of the forecasts of the past - the absence reliable prognostic procedure; the euphoria of the maiden successes of conquest of space; dominance of military and political- propaganda motives of implementation of the space programs before economical; to keep developments secret; competition of two super-powers USSR and USA etc. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A general design method for the variable structure control of distributed time-delay systems is studied in this paper. The proposed switching function and variable structure controller are of finite dimension. The basic idea is to construct a finite dimensional system which contains all the unstable poles of the original time-delay system and hence those unstable poles of the time delay system will be absorbed by the developed variable structure controller. The proposed method is applied to the stabilization of combustion in a liquid monopropellant rocket motor and satisfactory results are obtained by simulation study. Simulation results show that the developed variable structure controller can still stabilize the combustion when the two key parameters, pressure exponent gamma and maximal time lag r, change from their nominal value down to 0.0 and 0.1 respectively. By this result, we can somewhat overestimate the two parameters to obtain a reliable controller for the rocket motor control systems.

AB New robust Right control laws are developed for a reusable launch vehicle. The wide range of Right conditions, and the impossibility to obtain wind-tunnel data for most of the Right domain, requires using a robust control technique. The use of linear-adaptive control techniques to design the trajectory autopilot and to solve the inversion problem is proposed. Subspace-stabilization techniques are used to design the inner loop of control, which controls the vehicle attitude, The control is structured in two layers, The outer layer plays the role of an automatic pilot offering two operational modes: a trajectory mode and an attitude mode. In the trajectory mode the Right path and ground track are controlled, and in the attitude mode the autopilot controls attitude angles. The commands generated by the automatic pilot are inverted, by the use of a new and rather novel algorithm, to determine the required pitching, Polling, and yawing rate commands, which are then tracked by the inner loop of control. The inversion implements either bank-to-turn or skid-to-turn steering. The linear-adaptive methodology circumvents the use of difficult nonlinear control techniques and attendant analysis uncertainties through the use of linear disturbance accommodation observers to estimate and cancel the combined effects of nonlinear and/or uncertain terms. Subspace-stabilization techniques are used to steer the, system error state to a certain subspace S representing the described or specified servotracking error behavior, while controlling the motion on the subspace S to the origin in error space. Some numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the closed-loop response, with the proposed flight-control law, accurately tracks the prescribed flight and ground track trajectories.

AB A new computer analysis tool capable of predicting rocket-based combined-cycle engine performance data (thrust and I-sp) over a wide range of flight conditions and engine operating modes is presented. The tool is called SCCREAM, which stands for simulated combined-cycle rocket engine analysis module, SCCREAM is an object-oriented workstation-level code written in C++ that ran be remotely executed through a web-based user interface. It uses quasi-one-dimensional flow analysis techniques, component and combustion efficiencies, and an inlet pressure recovery schedule as simplifying assumptions, SCCREAM was created for the conceptual launch vehicle design environment and is capable of quickly generating large tables of engine performance data for use in subsequent trajectory optimization. An overview of SCCREAM and the program logic is presented. Results from SCCREAM are compared with published rocket-based combined-cycle engine performance data and with data generated by other engine analysis tools for a representative reference vehicle configuration.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID PELLET BED REACTOR; PROPULSION; ROCKET
AB A high-energy-utilization, dual-mode, electric pou er and propulsion system concept is described for a future crewed missions to Mars. The system uses a gas-cooled, nuclear reactor heat source and closed Brayton cycle (CBC) engines to convert thermal power to electricity. The He-Xe working fluid for the CBCs is also the nuclear reactor coolant. The fuel temperature and the inlet temperatures of the He-Xe of the nuclear reactor core and the CBC engines are kept almost constant during the propulsion and electric power modes to minimize thermal stresses. The temperature of the He-Xe exiting the nuclear reactor core is kept at least 200 K below the maximum fuel temperature. The electric power generated is kept the same during the propulsion and the power modes, but the reactor thermal power in the former could be several times higher. During the propulsion model the system's electric power, minus similar to1-5 kW(e) for housekeeping, operates a variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR). In addition, the reactor's thermal power, plus more than 85% of the heat load of the CBCs' radiators, is used to heat hydrogen. The hot hydrogen is mixed in the plasma exhaust of the VASIMR to provide both high thrust (>4000 N) and I-sp > 45,000 N . s/kg (similar to4,500 lbf.s/lbm), potentially reducing the travel time to Mars to 3 months. The system's electric power could also be used to support surface exploration of Mars. A dual-mode system based on the Pellet-bed reactor has a specific energy utilization of 400-500 W/kg and no single point failure. The system ran be tested fully assembled in a ground facility using electric heaters in place of the nuclear reactor. Operation and design parameters of a 40-kW(e) prototype are presented to illustrate the operation principle and demonstrated performance potential of the dual-mode system concept.

TI Structural dynamic analysis of solid rocket motor resonant burning
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID VORTEX
AB The term resonant burning is used by structural dynamicists to describe the coincidence of vortex shedding inside solid rocket motors with frequencies of longitudinal acoustic modes of the combustion chamber. The corresponding thrust oscillations excite launch vehicles that use solid rocket motors; however, system responses from resonant burning are generally enveloped by those for other Right events, and, traditionally, the design of primary launch and space vehicle structure has not been established by the resonant-burning dynamic environment. Recently, though, this phenomenon has emerged as a major dynamic event for new small-sized launch vehicles with single-segment motors as stages, An overview of resonant burning is provided, with an emphasis on features that influence structural dynamic analyses. Statistical assessments of motor internal pressure oscillations, and of spacecraft loads induced by resonant burning, are conducted. The results indicate that the phenomenon cannot generally be characterized by a normal probability distribution and that care must be taken when defining a resonant-burning environment for structural design, It is also shown that this excitation source is quasi periodic and that structural dynamic analyses that use stationary thrust oscillations can severely overpredict spacecraft accelerations.

AB A new method for multi-ignitable rocket motor design has been proposed in this paper, by analyzing Row, heat-transfer, and combustion of a non-Newtonian pasty propellant, in which oxidizer and fuel binder are mixed homogeneously. The new motor has advantages found in both solid- and liquid-propellant rochet motors. The motor discussed in this paper is also thrust adjustable, Moreover, because the propellant is ignited by surplus heat from the combustion chamber no additional ignition energy is needed. The key technology of this new method is the proposed reignitable igniter. A two-dimensional flow and heat-transfer model of the propellant inside the reignitable igniter has been developed. Control equations have also been solved numerically. Propellant temperatures inside the igniter holes have been obtained, in conjunction with a simple ignition criterion. The relationship between igniter temperatures, igniter length, igniter diameter, and drive pressure has also obtained. A combustion model applicable to the new pasty propellant is proposed on the basis of the current solid-propellant BDP (Beckstead-Derr-Price) combustion model. A prototype test apparatus has also been built for multipulse firing. Seven operation pulses were obtained. Each pulse lasts about 5 s, and the time interval between pulses is approximately 2 s.

TI Response surface and neural network techniques for rocket engine
   injector optimization
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The response surface methodology for rocket engine injector design optimization for which only modest amounts of data may exist is examined. Two main aspects are emphasized: relative performance of quadratic and cubic polynomial response surfaces and enhancement of the fidelity of the response surface via neural networks. A data set of 45 design points from a semi-empirical model for a shear coaxial injector element using gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen propellants is used to formulate response surfaces using quadratic and cubic polynomials. This original data set is also employed to train a two-layered radial basis neural network (RBNN). The trained network is then used to generate additional data to augment the original information available to characterize the design space. Quadratic and cubic polynomials are again used to generate response surfaces for this RBNN-enhanced data set, The response surfaces resulting from both the original and RBNN-enhanced data sets are compared for accuracy. Whereas the cubic fit is superior to the quadratic fit for each data set, the RBNN-enhanced data set is capable of improving the accuracy of the response surface if noticeable errors from polynomial curve fits are encountered. Furthermore, the RBNN-enhanced data set yields more consistent selections of optimal designs between cubic and quadratic polynomials. The techniques de, eloped can be directly applied to injector design and optimization for rocket propulsion.

ID HAMMERHEAD
AB When during the ascent through the Earth's atmosphere the structural response of an aerospace launch vehicle changes from the usually benign case of the buffet response to wind gusts and air turbulence to the self-excited type, the response amplitude increases dramatically and could often endanger the structural integrity of the launch vehicle. This is what occurs when the structural response starts to interact with and modify the unsteady separated Bow characteristics, which generates aerodynamic negative damping or undamping of the low-frequency bending modes. A literature survey has been performed to document how this condition has affected the various aerospace vehicles launched since the early 1960s, The developed analytic means, described in the referenced publications, can predict the worst-case vehicle response with the accuracy needed for preliminary design, provided that sufficiently detailed static aerodynamic data are available, The purpose is to help the design engineer determine whether any of the described Row phenomena that have been experienced by earlier launch vehicles could possibly occur on the new launch vehicle design, in which case the recommended analysis described in full detail in the referenced publications would need to be performed.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
AB The inverse method and the numerical optimization technique are developed and implemented for the design of space launch vehicles, which satisfy given heat transfer rate, fineness ratio and internal volume constraints, and show minimum drag characteristics. With the proper specification of the target pressure distribution, the inverse method is successfully applied to the design of a body with 21% less drag than the initial shape. Several gradient approximations, shape functions, and approximate analysis methods are utilized fur the design of optimum nose fairing shapes with heat flux and volume constraints. Several strategies are implemented to the design examples in hypersonic speeds, including a Korean three-stage sounding rocket, The designed bodies have less drag than the initial bodies while maintaining the surface heat transfer rate at the nose. These methods are demonstrated to be efficient design tools for the high-speed vehicle design.

TI Global implications of ozone loss in a space shuttle wake

AB Existing global model calculations of ozone depletion due to solid-fueled rocket motor (SRM) launches [Prather et al., 1990; Jackman et al., 1998] take into account the effect of globally dispersed chlorine emissions and ignore the ozone loss in the rocket wake. This ozone depletion in the wake could be substantial (up to 100% in the lower stratosphere during the first hour after exhaust [Ross et al., 1997a, 2000]). In this paper, we provide an estimate of whether wake ozone loss could accumulate after each SRM launch, leading to a larger ozone depletion on the global scale. To address this issue, we estimate an upper bound of the ozone loss in a space shuttle wake and use the Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc. two-dimensional model to simulate the global effect. For the scenarios considered, the global impact of the localized ozone loss in the wakes is at least an order of magnitude less than the effects from global dispersion of the SRM chlorine emissions alone ton the order of 10(-3)-10(-4) % versus 10(-2) % in the ozone column near 30 degreesN). Additional sensitivity studies performed for different wake dilution rates, seasons, locations, and local times of the shuttle launches and accounting for chlorine activation via ClONO2 + HCl + Cl-2 + HNO3 on alumina particles did not change this conclusion.

AB Prediction of rock socket shaft resistance is a complex problem. Conventional methods for predicting the peak shaft resistance are typically empirically related to unconfined compressive strength through the results of pile load tests. It is shown by reference to international pile socket databases that the degree of confidence which can be applied to these empirical methods is relatively low. Research at Monash University has been directed at understanding and then modelling the complex mechanisms of shear transfer at the interface between the socketed piles and the surrounding rock. Important factors that affect the strength of pile sockets have been identified in laboratory and numerical studies. With a knowledge of the effect of these factors, the reasons for the large scatter around traditional empirical correlations can be deduced. A computer program called ROCKET has been developed which encompasses all aspects of the Monash University rock socket research. This program has been used to develop design charts for rock-socketed piles based on unconfined compressive strength and a nondimensional factor which has been designated the shaft resistance coefficient (SRC). Implementation of the SRC method in design requires an estimate of the likely socket roughness to be made. Very few researchers or practitioners have measured socket roughness, so there is little available guidance in selection of appropriate values. Although many socket load tests are described in the technical literature, the physical parameter which is regularly missing is the socket roughness. With a knowledge of the shaft resistance, and an estimate of all other relevant parameters, the authors have been able to back-calculate the apparent socket roughness using the SRC method. Based on the back-calculated roughness data, socket roughness guidelines for use in analysis and design of rock sockets have been proposed. Using these roughness guidelines, it is shown that the SRC method is able to predict the scatter observed in previously published international load test databases.

AB This paper deals with an attitude control-system design technique for a spinning sounding rocket. A proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) type controller is developed for a dynamic model simplified by a complex summation method. The optimal PID gains at each design point are automatically obtained by using the co-evolutionary augmented Lagrangian method which can handle complicated specifications and constraints. The performance of the control system is verified through six degrees-of-freedom non-linear simulations, which shows that the optimized control system is robust against plant uncertainties and disturbances.

DE composites; cryogenic tank; RLV
AB It is essential to utilize carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) for main structural materials of cryogenic propellant tanks in order to realize the drastic weight reduction needed for efficient reusable space transportation systems. Recently developed toughened CFRP materials, which are expected to show good cryogenic properties, are considered promising candidates for these kinds of applications. The present study investigates cryogenic properties of candidate materials and structural elements, including Y-joint structural models. 300 turn diameter filament wound tank and 600 mm diameter lay up tanks were fabricated and tested. Based on these experimental data, the feasibility of a CFRP cryogenic tank is discussed and future research tasks are proposed.

AB The time has come to give serious thought to the use of the International Space Station (ISS) as a space platform to advance remote sensing research in several scientific disciplines. The European scientific community has been developing instrumentation for deployment on the ISS for some time now. Recently, NASA opened competitions for scientific programs to be supported as "Missions of Opportunity" to utilize the "EXPRESS Pallet" facility on the ISS. A single EXPRESS Pallet has the capability of carrying a collection of instruments similar to the payload of a conventional satellite. A major difference between ISS and satellite programs is that the research funding will be expended on scientific instrumentation and analysis and not on a spacecraft, launch vehicle, and flight operations. As the ISS becomes fully operational, EXPRESS Pallets could be deployed in short periods of time compared to preparing a satellite program. The ability to retrieve, improve, and re-fly an instrument is important to a progressive research program. This allows the experiment to be responsive to data analysis in a timely manner and also keep pace with developing technology. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water vapour concentration is one of the most important, yet one of the least known quantities of the mesosphere. Knowledge of water vapour concentration is the key to understanding many mesospheric processes, including the one that is primary focus of our investigation, Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC). The processes of formation and occurrence parameters of PMC constitute an interesting problem in their own right, but recent evidence had been provided which suggests that PMC are a critical indicator of climate change. In this context the feasibility of a low cost method of water vapour measurements using an instrument carried aloft by a sounding rocket has been examined and some of the results discussed. It is proposed to measure the strength of the 936nm water absorption line in a solar occultation configuration employing a CCD detector. This leads to the design of a small, low cost and low-mass instrument, which can be flown on a small rocket, of the type of the Orbital Sciences Corporation Viper 5. Alternatively the instrument can be flown as a "passenger" on larger rocket carrying other experiments. In either case flight costs are relatively low. Some performance simulations are presented showing that the instrument we have designed will be sufficiently sensitive to measure water vapor in concentrations that are expected at the summer mesopause, about 85 km height. Sufficient payload design work was carried out showing that the structural, thermal and electrical requirements for a flight on the Viper 5 rocket can be met and thus making the experiment feasible for a flight.

AB The aerobic biodegradation of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wastewater that contains mixtures of highly concentrated methylhydrazine/hydrazine, citric acid and their reaction product was studied on a laboratory-scale fixed film trickle-bed reactor. The degrading organisms, Achromobacter sp., Rhodococcus B30 and Rhodococcus J10, were immobilized on coarse sand grains used as support-media in the columns. Under continuous flow operation, Rhodococcus sp. degraded the methylhydrazine content of the wastewater from a concentration of 10 to 2.5 mg/mL within 12 days and the hydrazine from similar to0.8 to 0.1 mg/mL in 7 days. The Achromobacter sp. was equally efficient in degrading the organics present in the wastewater, reducing the concentration of the methylhydrazine from 10 to similar to5 mg/mL within 12 days and that of the hydrazine from similar to0.8 to 0.2 mg/mL in 7 days. The pseudo first-order rate constants of 0.137 day(-1) and 0.232 day(-1) were obtained for the removal of methylhydrazine and hydrazine, respectively, in wastewater in the reactor column. In the batch cultures, rate constants for the degradation were 0.046 and 0.079 day(-)1 for methylhydrazine and hydrazine respectively. These results demonstrate that the continuous flow bioreactor afford greater degradation efficiencies than those obtained when the wastewater was incubated with the microbes in growth-limited batch experiments. They also show that wastewater containing hydrazine is more amenable to microbial degradation than one that is predominant in methylhydrazine, in spite of the longer lag period observed for hydrazine containing wastewater. The influence of substrate concentration and recycle rate on the degradation efficiency is reported. The major advantages of the trickle-bed reactor over the batch system include very high substrate volumetric rate of turnover, higher rates of degradation and tolerance of the 100% concentrated NASA wastewater. The results of the present laboratory scale study will be of great importance in the design and operation of an industrial immobilized biofilm reactor for the treatment of methylhydrazine and hydrazine contaminated NASA wastewater.

AB It is established that self-oscillations in the gas cavity of a solid rocket motor are due to instability and periodic changes of large-scale compact vortex structures in the stagnation zones of the main flow of combustion products. Indirect data of full-scale tests and experimental studies show that compact stagnation zones are formed between the side wall of the gas cavity and the submerged nozzle and near the up bottom of the motor. A procedure was designed to calculate and predict Strouhal numbers and acoustic resonance phenomena in the gas cavity of a motor chamber due to changes of compact large-scale vortex structures.

AB A simulation of the droplet combustion in the high-pressure environment is very important in understanding the fundamental phenomena of liquid rocket, gas turbine and diesel engine combustion. Therefore, a more reliable ignition model of a droplet under high pressure condition is highly desirable in developing a useful tool for design. In this paper, the ignition model of the n-heptane droplet is suggested for high pressure environment and solved for the ignition delay. Its variations with the change in the ambient pressure and temperature are discussed for the cases with/without gravity so that the natural convection effects on the droplet ignition delay time are also examined. The Redlich-Kwong equation of state is used for calculating the phase equilibrium at the droplet surface under high pressure. The natural convection effects are considered by introducing so-called the time scale correction method. The results show that the logarithmic ignition delay time linearly decreases with the inverse of the ambient temperature, and its decreasing slope is independent of the ambient pressure. Thereby, the overall activation energy is found not to be affected by the pressure variation. As the pressure increases, the ignition delay time gets shorter since the droplet vaporization rate is enhanced. But, at a higher ambient pressure, the reduction rate in the ignition delay time becomes smaller. The natural convection effect is also found to make the ignition delay time shorter due to the improved heat feedback to the droplet.

DE gas generators; pyrotechnic; propellant; combustion
AB This work focuses particularly on solid energetic materials designed to produce high-pressure gas for pressurizing or inflating devices. In cool gas generators sodium azide is often used. Unfortunately this chemical exhibits drawbacks concerning toxicity and yield of gas. Another gas-generating agent is double base propellant, which has traditionally been used in the rocket-industry. However, it delivers toxic and reactive gases and its combustion temperature is high. In previous work a series of gas-generating materials have been proposed as potential alternatives fueled with double base propellant, azodicarbonamide, nitroguanidine, or guanidine nitrate and stoichiometricly oxidized with potassium nitrate or potassium perchlorate. The purpose of this paper is to examine and compare the burning characteristics of the previously proposed compositions. To carry out this characterization. methods typical for propellant technology are used. Ignition delay, time from ignition to maximum pressure, burning rate. and absolute vivacity have been investigated through closed vessel tests. Thanks to the use of a gaseous ignition mixture the form function of the tested grains is not deteriorated. This leads to fairly reproducible results for the burning rate and the absolute vivacity, despite possible discrepancies in the ignition delay. In most of the studied cases, the addition of an oxidizer tends to improve the ignition delay and the time from ignition to maximum pressure. In addition the burning rate and absolute vivacity increase significantly. The only exception is double base propellant, where the presence of an oxidizer causes relatively minor changes in its combustion properties.

AB Parallel Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) applications often exhibit irregular structure and dynamic load patterns. Many such applications have been developed using MPI. Incorporating dynamic load balancing techniques at the application-level involves significant changes to the design and structure of applications. On the other hand, traditional run-time systems for MPI do not support dynamic load balancing. Object-based parallel programming languages, such as Charm++ support efficient dynamic load balancing using object migration. However, converting legacy MPI applications to such object-based paradigms is cumbersome. This paper describes an implementation of MPI, called Adaptive MPI (AMPI) that supports dynamic load balancing for MPI applications. Conversion from MPI to this platform is straightforward even for large legacy codes. We describe our positive experience in converting the component codes ROCFLO and ROCSOLID of a Rocket Simulation application to AMPI.

AB DROPPS (The Distribution and Role of Particles in the Polar Summer Mesosphere) was a highly coordinated international study conducted in July 1999. It involved two sequences of rockets launched from the Norwegian rocket range in Andoya, Norway. These studies were designed to investigate the properties of the polar summer mesosphere, particularly relating to polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) and their possible relationship to particles (aerosol and dust layers) and to noctilucent clouds (NLC). Each of the two sequences included a DROPPS NASA-Black Brant payload, consisting of an array of instruments to measure the electrodynamic and optical structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The instruments were provided by participants from several US and European laboratories. The DROPPS payloads were each accompanied by a sequence of several European payloads (MIDAS, Mini-MIDAS, and Mini-DUSTY) designed to study electrodynamic and neutral atmospheric structure of the same region, and by several meteorological rockets to provide wind and temperature data in the critical region of study. ALOMAR Lidars, and MF and MST Radars (all located adjacent to the Andoya launch site) were used to continuously monitor the mesosphere for NLCs and PMSEs, respectively. EISCAT VHF radar (Tromso, Norway) provided similar information about PMSEs at 130 kin NE from Andoya. Sequence 1 was launched during the night of 5-6 July into a strong PMSE display with a weak NLC at the base of the PMSE. Sequence 2 was launched on the early morning of 14 July into a strong NLC, but surprisingly with no PMSE evident. Here we describe the details of the program along with a few preliminary results.

TI Microstructure and mechanical property characterization of shear formed
   Al-Li alloy 2195 for launch vehicle applications
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING & MANUFACTURING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Advanced manufacturing processes such as near-net-shape forming can reduce production costs and increase the reliability of launch vehicle and airframe structural components through the reduction of material scrap and part count and the minimization of structural joints. The current research is an investigation of the evolution of grain structure, texture, and tensile properties of shear formed Al-Li alloy 2195 cylinders for launch vehicle applications. The cylinders were characterized after various amounts of shear-forming strain using optical metallographic techniques, orientation distribution function (ODF) analysis and standard tensile tests. The cylinders exhibited a fairly homogeneous microstructure and nearly random texture for low levels of shear forming strain. The grain structure became increasingly inhomogeneous as shear-forming strain increased, accompanied by an increase in overall texture intensity and the development of an FCC-type deformation texture. The tensile strength increased with shear-fort-ning strain, while the ductility decreased. It is emphasized that these results are for the first full-scale shear formed Al-Li test article. As such, the microstructure and propel-ties have not yet been optimized through modifications to the shear-forming and secondary processing parameters.

TI Transient force reduction in electromechanical actuators for
   thrust-vector control
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a move within the aerospace community to use electromechanical actuators (EMA) in thrust-vector control (TVC) applications. However, shock-wave forces that occur during startup and shutdown of unthrottled TVC rocket engines excite resonance in the mechanical dynamics, This results in very large forces transmitted through the actuator. Additionally, with traditional compensation, the position control system must be designed with low bandwidth because of the typically low resonant frequency. Dynamic force feedback (DFF) compensation is proposed to reduce the effects of resonance, Utilizing a motor position sensor and a load cell in the actuator mount, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) position control loop is closed in parallel with a Force control loop to provide resonance reduction and transmitted force reduction. This allows higher position control bandwidths while reducing the transmitted forces. The controller design methodology uses two independent loop-shaping procedures, which are separated by their effective frequency ranges. The techniques are validated with experimental data from an EMA-TVC simulator, showing improvements in both the position control and the transmitted forces. Additionally, the controller is shown to be robust with respect to variation in the resonance.

AB A model of a linear aerospike rocket nozzle that consists of coupled aerodynamic and structural analyses has been developed. A nonlinear computational fluid dynamics code is used to calculate the aerodynamic thrust, and a three-dimensional finite element model is used to determine the structural response and weight. The model will be used to demonstrate multidisciplinary design capabilities for relevant engine concepts, assess performance of various multidisciplinary design approaches, and provide a guide for future application development. In this study, the multidisciplinary design problem is formulated using the multidisciplinary feasible strategy, The results For the multidisciplinary feasible formulation are presented with comparisons against sequential aerodynamic and structural designs. Significant improvements are demonstrated by using a multidisciplinary approach in comparison with the single-discipline design strategy.

TI Design of a guided missile interceptor using a genetic algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB An apportioned pareto genetic algorithm was used to manipulate a solid rocket design code, an aerodynamic design code, and a three-loop autopilot to produce guided missile interceptor designs capable of accurately engaging a high-speed/high-altitude target. Definition of the optimization problem required 29 design variables, and 4 primary goals were established to assess the performance of the interceptor designs. Design goals included the following: minimize miss distance, minimize intercept time, minimize takeoff weight, and minimize maximum g loading. In 50 generations, the genetic algorithm was able to develop 2 basic types of external aerodynamic designs that performed nearly the same, with miss distances less than 1.0 ft. The solid rocket motors that propelled these external shapes shared common characteristics such as a large initial burning area and a large combustion chamber volume. The genetic algorithm did not prefer maximizing the amount of fuel within the rocket motor case thigh fuel volume ratio). A higher fuel volume ratio typically means higher launch weight, but does not necessarily guarantee faster intercepts given finite thermal limits. Examination of the intercept trajectories themselves shows that standard proportional navigation guidance works adequately, but could probably be improved by thrust compensation, especially during the launch transient. The three-loop autopilot performs well even for high-altitude engagements, and the analytic gain determination makes the autopilot straightforward to implement.

AB A fully reusable rocket vehicle is proposed to demonstrate good operability characteristics both un the ground and in flight. For achieving technical readiness for future space transportation systems, design considerations not only for higher-performance-related issues but also those for good operability are needed. The proposed vehicle is to be used as a sounding rocket and has the capabilities of ballistic flight, returning to the launch site, and landing vertically, making use of clustered liquid-hydrogen rocket engines. Before the development of this type of reusable rocket was initiated, a small test vehicle with a liquid-hydrogen rocket engine was built and flight tested. A demonstration of vertical landing and exercise of turnaround operation for repeated flights are the major objectives of the test vehicle. Two flights were performed in succession, and the flight-test operation provided many valuable experiences for designing the fully reusable rocket vehicle.

DT Article
ID GENERALIZED THERMOELASTICITY; INFINITE BODY; PULSE
AB The problem of dynamic thermoelastic stresses in a spherical shell with fixed boundaries whose inner surface is subjected to a step jump in temperature is considered. The analysis is carried out in the uncoupled framework under the classical Lord and Shulman (1967) and Green and Lindsay (1972) formulations of thermoelasticity. Exact solutions for the temperature and displacement equations are obtained using the Laplace transform and eigenfunction expansion method, respectively. Of particular interest is the propagation and nature of discontinuities in the temperature, displacement, and stress fields that are possible under the two nonclassical theor ies. Exact expressions for the magnitudes of discontinuities in these quantities are also given, and shock waves are noted Numerical results are presented graphically along with a comparison of the three models. In addition, special and limiting cases of the physical parameters are investigated and the application of this research to fuel vessels used in rocket engine testing are noted. Lastly, a discussion concerning which of the three theories is the most physically acceptable is given, with the Lord and Shulman formulation emerging as the clear overall choice, and conclusions are stated.

DE bending vibration; notch filter; adaptation; Gauss-Newton algorithm
AB An adaptive notch filter design considering the body bending vibration for the attitude control of a two-stage sounding rocket is discussed in this paper. The algorithm adapts the parameter while keeping the poles of the notch filter inside the unit circle on the z plane, and thus satisfies the conditions concerning stability of the filter all the time. Only a single parameter of the filter is adapted to simplify the algorithm and thus to speed up the convergence rate. Applying this adaptive notch filter to the two-stage sounding rocket results in stable response characteristics of the attitude control system which has been unstable without adaptation. This newly designed method is simple and less CPU intensive, and is easier to implement in real-time application.

AB This paper describes the design and construction of a quasi-three-stage radiator as a means of passively cooling an X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) which was at a distance of about I in from a radiating aperture having an unobscured view to cold space. The design was tested through thermal balance measurements which confirmed that a base temperature of - 150 degreesC could be achieved at the CCD. The low mass design was essential in ensuring the absence of significant resonant frequencies of vibration below 100 Hz. The system forms part of the EPIC instrument on the European Space Agency (ESA) cornerstone X-Ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) mission which was recently and successfully launched on an Ariane V rocket.

AB The Combustion and Environment Group of the Propulsion and Performance Department at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency proposed a bipropellant (H2O2 and hydrocarbon fuel) hybrid rocket-turbine engine for micro air vehicle (MAV) propulsion. A prototype bipropellant system was designed, built and tested to assess the full benefits of the rocket part of this type of engine. The operating parameters of the prototype engine were compared with predictions obtained in an earlier feasibility study. A considerable amount of knowledge on the usage and performance of H2O2 has been gained from these experiments. The test results show good agreement with predictions made in the feasibility study. Heat loss from the nozzle and ignition of the fuel are identified to be major problems which must be overcome before the engine can be developed into a viable propulsion system for MAVs.

   EQUATION
AB Modern computational and experimental tools for aerodynamics and propulsion applications have matured to a stage where they can provide substantial insight into engineering processes involving fluid flows, and can be Fruitfully utilized to help improve the design of practical devices. In particular. rapid and continuous development in aerospace engineering demands that new design concepts be regularly proposed to meet goals for increased performance, robustness and safety while concurrently decreasing cost. To date, the majority of the effort in design optimization of fluid dynamics has relied on gradient-based search algorithms. Global optimization methods can utilize the information collected from various sources and by different tools. These methods offer multi-criterion optimization, handle the existence of multiple design points and trade-offs via insight into the entire design space, can easily perform tasks in parallel, and are often effective in filtering the noise intrinsic to numerical and experimental data. However, a successful application of the global optimization method needs to address issues related to data requirements with an increase in the number of design variables, and methods for predicting the model performance. In this article, we review recent progress made in establishing suitable global optimization techniques employing neural-network- and polynomial-based response surface methodologies. Issues addressed include techniques for construction of the response surface, design of experiment techniques for supplying information in an economical manner, optimization procedures and multi-level techniques, and assessment of relative performance between polynomials and neural networks. Examples drawn From wing aerodynamics, turbulent diffuser flows, gas-gas injectors, and supersonic turbines are employed to help demonstrate the issues involved in an engineering design context. Both the usefulness of the existing knowledge to aid current design practices and the need for future research are identified. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern computational and experimental tools for aerodynamics and propulsion applications have matured to a stage where they can provide substantial insight into engineering processes involving fluid flows, and can be Fruitfully utilized to help improve the design of practical devices. In particular. rapid and continuous development in aerospace engineering demands that new design concepts be regularly proposed to meet goals for increased performance, robustness and safety while concurrently decreasing cost. To date, the majority of the effort in design optimization of fluid dynamics has relied on gradient-based search algorithms. Global optimization methods can utilize the information collected from various sources and by different tools. These methods offer multi-criterion optimization, handle the existence of multiple design points and trade-offs via insight into the entire design space, can easily perform tasks in parallel, and are often effective in filtering the noise intrinsic to numerical and experimental data. However, a successful application of the global optimization method needs to address issues related to data requirements with an increase in the number of design variables, and methods for predicting the model performance. In this article, we review recent progress made in establishing suitable global optimization techniques employing neural-network- and polynomial-based response surface methodologies. Issues addressed include techniques for construction of the response surface, design of experiment techniques for supplying information in an economical manner, optimization procedures and multi-level techniques, and assessment of relative performance between polynomials and neural networks. Examples drawn From wing aerodynamics, turbulent diffuser flows, gas-gas injectors, and supersonic turbines are employed to help demonstrate the issues involved in an engineering design context. Both the usefulness of the existing knowledge to aid current design practices and the need for future research are identified. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
