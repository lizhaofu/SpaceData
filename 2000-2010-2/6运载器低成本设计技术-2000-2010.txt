AB Large structural problems with high precision and complexity require a high-performance computation using the efficient parallel algorithm. The purpose of this paper is to present the parallel performance of thermal-structural coupled analysis tested on a parallel cluster system. In the coupled analysis, the heat transfer analysis is carried out, and then the structural analysis is performed based on temperature distribution. For the automatic and efficient connection of two parallel analysis modules, the several communication patterns were studied. The parallel performance was demonstrated for the sample and the real application problems, such as a laminated composite material by the DNS(Direct Numerical Simulation) approach and an aerospace launch vehicle model.

AB The modelling of ablation of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites utilized as rocket engine hot parts is addressed under the angle of the competition between bulk transport of reactants and heterogeneous mass transfer, associated to reactivity contrasts between constituent phases. A numerical solver based on a simple model and built on a VOF technique allows direct simulation at two scales. Its application to actual complex materials is performed: the results are consistent with experimental data and help understanding the origin of the material behaviour, either in terms of acquired surface morphology or in terms of effective recession rate.

DE Lunar lander; Secondary payload
AB The development of low cost missions for lunar exploration has emerged as a topic of increasing interest. Recently a study team from JPL was tasked to consider potential high-value lunar surface science and exploration missions that could be performed with small, low cost landed assets, with particular emphasis on missions that could be flown as secondary payloads on evolved expendable launch vehicle (EELV) launches. A mission concept and flight system design was developed in the course of this study that would deliver a network of up to six individual landers to a local lunar region, utilizing the full capabilities of the EELV secondary payload adapter (ESPA). The braking burn of the six landers would be performed by a single solid rocket motor integral with the ESPA ring, following which the landers would separate from the ESPA and perform final descent and precision landing using their own onboard propulsion systems. The six landers would initiate a one year mission, performing site survey and environmental science measurements including illumination, temperature, radiation, soil mechanics, and seismometry. Additional payload accommodation would be available on each lander to include unique experiments. The lander design was constrained to fit within the requirements for accommodation on the ESPA. These include a wet mass of no more than 180 kg, and dimensions that fit in an envelope of 61x71x96cm. The total landed mass of the conceptual spacecraft is similar to 140kg which would deliver a total of similar to 15 kg of payload mass to the lunar surface, per lander. In addition to the multi-lander ESPA-based design, a single lander flight system variant was developed that could enable globally distributed network science at very low cost. This paper discusses the mission concepts, flight system designs and numerous system engineering challenges that led to the development of this uniquely flexible and cost effective lunar mission concept.

AB In this study, nozzle rotational angle was obtained from measuring axial displacements from displacement gauges. Compensation equations for offaxis and slip effects of the displacement gauge were newly developed to obtain the nozzle rotational angle. A thrust vector control stroke test was conducted to provide linear coefficients related to pitch, yaw, and inclinometer angles with respect to the thrust vector control input voltage. The convergence of the compensation equations was satisfied with a percent relative error, which was under 0.0004%. From the compensation equations and the linear coefficients, the nozzle rotational angle history was accurately obtained in the thrust vector control scenario test within 0.01 deg. However, there was an offset in the rotational angle in the ground firing tests. This offset was within the maximum 0.04 deg, and it was caused by the deformation of the end position of the support beam, which was induced by combustion pressure.

AB Pronounced aeroacoustic resonances are exhibited in the flowfield where a jet emerges from an orifice or a nozzle and impinges on a solid Surface. One instance where such resonances are produced is in a high speed jet impingement, such as in the space launch vehicle systems, jet-engine exhaust impingement, and in the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, etc. A highly unsteady flowfield leading to a drastic increase of noise level with very high dynamic pressure and thermal loads are noticed on nearby surfaces results dramatic lift loss, severe ground erosion and hot gas ingestion to the inlet in the jet engines. This highly unsteady behavior of the impinging jets is due to a feedback loop between the fluid and acoustic fields. In actual jet flow, the working gas may contain condensable gas Such as steam or moist air. In these cases, the non-equilibrium condensation may Occur at the region between nozzle exit and an object. The jet flow with non-equilibrium condensation may be quite different from that without condensation. Therefore, in this study, the effect of the non-equilibrium condensation of moist air on the axisymmetric under-expanded supersonic impinging jet on a vertical flat plate was investigated numerically.

AB Turbopumps which pressurize fuels and oxidizers are generally used to operate liquid rocket engine for space launch vehicles. It is considered very important to predict fatigue properties at elevated temperatures for the design and manufacturing of reliable turbopump systems. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is one of the most promising manufacturing methods for gas turbine rotors. In this research, five kinds of Ni-based superalloys (Inconel 718 HIP, Inconel 718 HIP and heat treated, MAR-M-247 HIP. MAR-M-247 HIP and heat treated and Rene 95 HIP) were investigated at elevated temperatures. Original universal slopes method, modified universal slopes method, Mitchell's method, Baumel and Seeger's method, and Ong's method have been used for predicting the high temperature low-cycle fatigue performance. Among these methods, Mitchell's method showed the best adaptation results for the life prediction of Ni-based HIP superalloys. A novel equation was suggested by modification of Mitchell's method to predict Ni-based HIP superalloys at elevated temperature more accurately. The equation predicted well the low-cycle fatigue of HIP superalloys as well as of cast Rene 80 at elevated temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Because of their unique ablative properties, many carbon-based heterogeneous materials are used as components for thermal protection of systems used at extreme temperatures. such as atmospheric re-entry shields and rocket nozzles. Among other issues, the design of such systems relies critically on the knowledge of surface roughness evolution. This paper gives a synthetic view of an approach of ablation, either by oxidation or by sublimation, which is started from the material point of view. First, the morphology is studied: various features and scales of roughness are presented, and a classification is proposed. Second, a modelling strategy is built. It is based on the competition between bulk and heterogeneous transfer, with possible reactivity contrasts between the material constituents. Numerical results at various scales are given. Some predicted morphologies are in correct agreement with the experimental observations. A parameter variation study shows that the morphological features are dictated by the reactivity contrast of the material components, and by diffusion/reaction competitions. This allows to identify physico-chemical parameters from the roughness geometry, as in an inverse method. The approach is validated quantitatively in the case of the oxidation of a 3D C/C composite.

TI ELV: Pressure-fed LOx/LH2 upper stage
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Cries is leading extensive studies for the future generation of ELVs. The trend is today to research easy to use, robust and reliable solutions for the propulsion of future expendable launch vehicles but also with a high level of performances associated to as low as possible recurring cost of the launch vehicle. Among the different configurations (i.e. "linear", linear with SRBs, tri stages, parallel with cross feeding) conventional two stage architecture seems the one of the best to reach these goals. In the two stage configuration, there is competition between SRB (500ton of propellant), LOx/LH2 (350ton of propellant) or even LOx/methane, but always the second stage is cryotechnic (LH2/LOx), different technological solutions are possible.
   A way could be an extensive use of composite materials both for the structures, the tanks and the engines with use, as much as possible of automatic processes. In near future breakthrough or improvement of the fiber strength may increase the interest of such technologies.
   The aim of this paper is to present the technical choices for 40ton of propellant second stage leading to cost effective configuration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A mechanics based linear analysis of the problem of dynamic instabilities in slender space launch vehicles is undertaken. The flexible body dynamics of the moving vehicle is studied in an inertial frame of reference, including velocity induced curvature effects, which have not been considered so far in the published literature. Coupling among the rigid-body modes, the longitudinal vibrational modes and the transverse vibrational modes due to asymmetric lifting-body cross-section are considered. The model also incorporates the effects of aerodynamic forces and the propulsive thrust of the vehicle. The effects of the coupling between the combustion process (mass variation, developed thrust etc.) and the variables involved in the flexible body dynamics (displacements and velocities) are clearly brought out. The model is one-dimensional, and it can be employed to idealised slender vehicles with complex shapes. Computer simulations are carried out using a standard eigenvalue problem within h-p finite element modelling framework. Stability regimes for a vehicle subjected to propulsive thrust are validated by comparing the results from published literature. Numerical simulations are carried out for a representative vehicle to determine the instability regimes with vehicle speed and propulsive thrust as the parameters. The phenomena of static instability (divergence) and dynamic instability (flutter) are observed. The results at low Mach number match closely with the results obtained from previous models published in the literature.

AB A set of equations is developed to describe changes in cloud dispersity due to condensation and gravitational coagulation in the area of the salt particle diffusion in hygroscopic seeding of convective clouds with antihail rockets. Competition for moisture between the natural cloud droplets, entrained in the area from outside by turbulent diffusion, and artificial NaCl particles is taken into account. Optimum versions of hygroscopic seeding aimed at precipitation enhancement are discussed.

TI Trajectory Analysis for Vertical Takeoff and Vertical Landing Reusable
   Launch Vehicle's Upper Stage
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID ASCENT GUIDANCE; ENTRY GUIDANCE; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN
AB Reusable launch vehicles are a promising business for the future because of their flexibility, reliability, low cost, and good operability. There are two takeoff styles: the vertical takeoff and the horizontal takeoff. Compared to the horizontal takeoff vehicle, the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle has advantages, such as a shorter down-range landing, a quicker recovery system (wherein takeoff and landing happen in approximately the same location), and a lighter weight. A vertical profile is used for vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles to achieve a recovery at the launch site. However, the first stage of the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle (RLV) typically can provide a very small or even zero velocity to its second or upper stage, if the upper stage is released at the peak altitude. Therefore, primarily, this type of launch vehicle is used to achieve hundreds of seconds in a microgravity environment. The upper stage payload delivery capabilities of a vertical takeoff RLV and its potential applications are described from a trajectory point of view. A modified optimal control methodology and an intuitive method of the trajectory control, called energy for altitude and time, are used to determine the maximum throw distance, maximum flight time, and orbital insertion capabilities for certain payloads, separately. The results from this investigation show the possibilities of expanding the applications for the VTVL suborbital RLV.

TI Opportunities for a Liquid Rocket Feed System Based on Electric Pumps
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A feed system for liquid-propellant rocket engines based on electric pumps powered by batteries is proposed. It is proven to stand as a viable alternative to the pressure-gas feed system. The dependence of the feed system mass on the different operating parameters is obtained so as to identify the conditions favoring its adoption, that is, a relatively long burning time and a fairly high chamber pressure. Under such conditions, the proposed system is shown to offer significant mass savings with respect to the pressure-gas system when advanced batteries are used. This advantage is further enhanced by the beneficial effect of chamber pressure on the engine effective exhaust velocity. A test case for a low Earth orbit to geostationary equatorial orbit transfer is also presented to identify the optimum value of the burning time, deriving from the competition between the feed system mass and the effect of gravitational losses.

AB This paper describes an effort to optimize the design of an entire space launch vehicle to low Earth (circular) orbit, consisting of multiple stages using a genetic algorithm with the goal of minimizing vehicle weight and ultimately vehicle cost. The entire launch vehicle system is analyzed using various multistage configurations to reach low Earth orbit. Specifically, three- and four-stage solid propellant vehicles have been analyzed. The vehicle performance modeling requires that analysis from four separate disciplines be integrated into the design optimization process. The disciplines of propulsion characteristics, aerodynamics, mass properties, and flight dynamics have been integrated to produce a high-fidelity system model of the entire vehicle. In addition, the system model has been validated using the existing launch vehicle data. The cost model is mass based and uses extensive historical data to produce a cost estimating relationship for a solid propellant vehicle. For the design optimization, the goal is for the genetic algorithm to minimize the differences between the desired and actual orbital parameters. This ensures that the payload achieves the desired orbit. One final goal is to minimize the overall vehicle mass, thus minimizing the system cost per launch. This paper will represent the first effort of its kind to minimize the solid propellant launch vehicle cost at the preliminary design level using a genetic algorithm.

AB As a part of the Korea National Space Program, the Korean government has led the Sounding Rocket Program by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) providing enhanced capabilities across a spectrum of earth sciences and/or astrophysics-related disciplines. In this paper, the Korean Sounding Rocket Program during 1993-2002 is introduced. This program includes Korea Sounding Rocket (KSR)-I, KSR-II, and KSR-III, and a total of five soundings were carried out. Two had flown in KSR-I series. two in KSR-II, and one in KSR-III. The main mission objective is to provide the opportunity to scientists for researching earth sciences and/or astrophysics and to improve Korean rocket development technologies including payload instruments, flight systems, ground systems, operational techniques, and interfaces between subsystems. As demand increased for launching of low-orbit earth satellites internally and externally, the Korean government was ambitiously firing the Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV) Program in 2002, based on experience throughout the Sounding Rocket Program and preparing the world market for space launch vehicles.

AB Solutions to thermal insulation problems using aerogel beads were demonstrated for space launch vehicles using a model of the space shuttle external tank's liquid hydrogen (LH2) intertank. Test results using liquid helium show that with aerogel, the nitrogen mass inside the intertank is greatly reduced and free liquid nitrogen is eliminated. Physisorption within the aerogel was also investigated, showing that the sorption ratio (liquid nitrogen to aerogel beads) is about 62%. The insulating effectiveness of the aerogel shows that cryopumping is driven by thermal communication between warm and cold surfaces. This technology can solve heat transfer problems and augment existing thermal protection systems on launch vehicles. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION; COMBUSTION
AB A nested direct/indirect method is used to find the optimal design for a microgravity platform which is based on a hybrid sounding rocket. The direct optimization of the parameters that affect the motor design is coupled with the indirect trajectory optimization to maximize a given mission performance index. A gas-pressure feed system is used, with three different propellant combinations. The feed system exploits a pressurizing gas, namely, helium, when hydrogen peroxide or liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer. The simplest blowdown design is compared with a more complex pressurizing system, which has an additional gas tank that allows for a phase with constant propellant tank pressure. Only self-pressurization is considered with nitrous oxide; two different models are used to describe the behavior of the tank pressurization. The simplest model assumes liquid/vapor equilibrium. A two-phase model is also proposed: Saturated vapor and superheated liquid are considered and the liquid/vapor mass transfer evaluation is based on the liquid spinodal line. Results show that the different tank-pressurization models yield minimal differences of the optimal motor characteristics. Performance differs slightly due to the different mass of the residual oxidizer. The propellant comparison for the present case shows better performance for hydrogen peroxide/ polyethylene with respect to liquid oxygen/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, while nitrous oxide/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene remains attractive for system simplicity and low costs.

AB A solution to the problem of model-free intelligent attitude control of aerospace launch vehicles is presented. Emphasis is placed on the development of learning the proper action through reinforcement learning for problems that have no model or in which the model is too complex. One approach to solving this class of problems is via motivation from emotional learning mechanism in the mammalian brain. A simple but effective mathematical model from the emotional learning mechanism in the human brain is presented and developed to solve the closed-loop command tracking problem. The emotional learning mechanism needs a set of sensory inputs and a reinforcing signal to produce action. Determination and tuning of the parameters of the reinforcing signal and sensory input are left to be solved through evolution by a genetic algorithm. It is shown in simulations that the mathematical model of the emotional learning mechanism can be initialized as a powerful feedback control algorithm.

DE anomalous inconsistency; Bayes inference; system failure probability
ID DISTRIBUTIONS; FAILURE
AB A fundamental logical problem in the Bayesian inference of a series system's failure probability is described, a practical means for its mitigation is discussed, and its application to space launch vehicles is illustrated. The problem is the "Bayesian Anomaly," the difference in the system's failure probability per operation inferred from prior estimates, and test or operational experience applied at a lower-level of the system; and from the convolution of the same priors, and of the same experience applied at the system level (or any level above the first). In particular, unlike in it classical inference, the mean estimates differ critically. Although it is not possible to entirely resolve the problem, a practical procedure for mitigating it, establishing consistency among the mean and variance estimates at the two levels, is delineated.

AB Supersonic impinging Jets, such as those occurring in the space launch vehicle systems, multi-stage rocket separation, jet-engine exhaust impingement, terrestrial rocket launch, and in the next generation short take off and vertical landing (STOL) aircraft, generate a highly oscillatory flow with very high unsteady loads on the near by structures and the landing surfaces. These high-pressure and acoustic loads are also accompanied by a dramatic loss in lift during aircraft hover. Previous studies of supersonic impinging jets suggest that the highly unsteady behavior of the impinging jets is due to a feedback loop between the fluid And acoustic fields, which leads to these adverse effects, In actual supersonic jet flow, usually the working gas nu be condensable gas such as steam or moist air. In these cases, the non-equilibrium condensation may occur in the region between nozzle exit and an object. The jet flow with non-equilibrium condensation may be quite different from that without condensation, In the present study, characteristics of under-expanded axisymmetric supersonic impinging moist air jets on a vertical flat plate were investigated numerically.

AB The paper concerns possible concept variants of a partially reusable Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicle derived from the advanced basic launcher (Ariane-2010) by means of substitution of the EAP Solid Rocket Boosters for a Reusable Starting Stage consisting two Liquid-propellant Reusable Fly-Back Boosters called "Bargouzin". This paper describes the status of the presently studied RFBB concepts during its three phases. The first project phase was dedicated to feasibility expertise of liquid-rocket reusable fly-back boosters ("Baikal" type) utilization for heavy-lift space launch vehicle. The design features and main conclusions are presented. The second phase has been performed with the purpose of selection of preferable concept among the alternative ones for the future Ariane LV modernization by using RFBB instead of EAP Boosters. The main requirements, logic of work, possible configuration and conclusion are presented. Initial aerodynamic, ballistic, thermoloading, dynamic loading, trade-off and comparison analysis have been performed on these concepts. The third phase consists in performing a more detailed expertise of the chosen LV concept. This part summarizes some of the more detailed results related to flight performance, system mass, thermoprotection system, aspects of technologies, ground complex modification, comparison analyses and conclusion.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Multidisciplinary design optimization of solid-fueled multistage space launch vehicles requires complex high-dimensional simulation models. To improve on the ability to efficiently explore and approximate large subspaces of these models, this research develops a new set of experimental designs for metamodeling with support vector regression. We propose to Latinize and improve the orthogonality of Hammersley sequence sampling for creating nearly orthogonal and excellent space-filling designs. Multiple measures are used to assess the quality of designed experiments. The designs are used to create metamodels of trajectory simulation of space launch vehicles using support vector regression. A hybrid genetic algorithm uses metamodels to identify minimum-launch-weight space launch vehicles. This approach resulted in an overall rapid and efficient design optimization scheme.

AB A new ultrahigh strength low alloy steel 0.3C-CrMoV(ESR), having an ultimate tensile strength and 0.2% proof strength of above 1,700 and 1,500 MPa, respectively, in quenched and tempered condition, was developed primarily as a cost effective material for space launch vehicle applications. Welding is a major step in the fabrication of most of the pressure vessels, structures and equipments. Steels with carbon equivalent in excess of 0.40 wt% show a tendency to form martensite on welding, and therefore are considered difficult to weld. 0.3C-CrMoV(ESR) steel has a carbon equivalent value of nearly 1.0 that classifies it as a 'very difficult to weld' steel. In addition it has a niobium content of about 0.10% and a vanadium content of 0.25%. It is known that niobium content of more than 0.02 wt% has a deleterious effect on the toughness properties of low carbon welds. It has also been reported that the effect of niobium on weld metal toughness is more deleterious in the presence of vanadium. Hence, in the present study, the properties of the weldment of this new steel under different heat treatment conditions (HT-1 and HT-2) have been studied. In HT-1 condition, the plates were welded in hardened and tempered condition and no further heat treatment was given after welding, while in HT-2 condition, the annealed plates were subjected to welding followed by hardening and tempering heat treatments. For HT-1 condition, only tensile properties were evaluated. The welded plates under HT-2 condition were evaluated for tensile properties, fracture toughness, residual strength and microstructure features.

AB An analytical model describing the kinetics of carbon dissolution in burning aluminum droplets has been developed in order to simulate its effects under solid rocket motor conditions. A carbon dissolution rate (k) was introduced in different droplet regression laws and depending on the heterogeneous kinetics between the At surface and the surrounding gases. The model was validated using previous experiments performed by the authors on milli meter-sized A1 droplets burning in several CO2-containing atmospheres at atmospheric pressure (P = 1 atm). It has been shown that the carbon dissolution is affected by the presence of hydrogen due to competition between CO and H-2 chemisorption. The model was then applied to aluminized propellants (AP/HTPB) at high pressures (P = 60 atm) and high temperatures (T = 3000 and 3500 K), as well as at various burning rates and adsorption conditions. Though the accuracy of the extrapolation results needs further improvement, it has been shown that the carbon dissolution process should not be neglected in order to achieve global understanding of the combustion of At particles, particularly agglomerates.

AB The aerospace launch vehicle, developed today by manufacturers, is characterized by high nonlinearity, open loop instability and time-varying behaviors. The transfer functions of the vehicle can be extracted using well-known linearization methodology. This paper presents an alternative to obtain the transfer functions via closed-loop identification using six degrees of freedom nonlinear simulation software. The pitch program is taken into account as the external excitation. Control and stability of the process are performed using robust PID controller. The model structure with some unknown parameters is obtained after mathematical modeling, thus the case of our problem is a parameter identification one. Time-variant parameters are estimated by Kalman filter approach with the aid of ARX model structure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In some ecological settings, an individual's fitness depends on both its own phenotype (individual-level selection) as well as the phenotype of the individuals with which it interacts (group-level selection). Using contextual analysis to measure multilevel selection in experimental stands of Arabidopsis thaliana, we detected significant linear selection that reversed across individual versus group levels for two composite phenotypic traits, "size" and "elongation." In both cases, selection at the individual level acted to increase values of these traits, presumably due to their positive effect on resource acquisition. Group selection favored decreased values of the same traits. Nonlinear selection was weak but significant in several cases, including stabilizing selection on developmental rate; individuals with very rapid development likely had lower than average fitness due to their reduced resource level at reproduction, while very delayed reproduction may have resulted in lower fitness if prolonged competition for resources reduced overall environmental quality and fitness of all individuals in a group. Under this scenario, stabilizing selection on individual traits is evidence of selection at the group level. Significant density-dependent selection suggests that a threshold density must be reached before group selection acts. Below this threshold, selection at the individual level affects phenotypic evolution more strongly than group selection. A second experiment measured multilevel selection in progeny stands of the original experimental plants. Multilevel selection again acted antagonistically on a composite trait that included size and elongation as well as on an architectural trait, branch production. The magnitude of individual versus group selection was relatively similar in the progeny generation, and the observed balance of individual versus group selection across densities is generally consistent with the hypotheses that multilevel selection can contribute to phenotypic evolution and to important demographic phenomena, including soft selection and the "law of constant yield."

AB Gas leakage through a damaged network in composite laminates is experimentally evaluated to assess fuel leakage in relation to the applicability of high-performance composites to cryogenic propellant tanks of space launch vehicles. Using [0(2)/theta(2)](S) (theta = 45, 60, 75 and 90) laminates, matrix cracks in 0 degrees plies are induced by three-point flexural loading and subsequent uniaxial tensile tests of laminates in 0 degrees direction to produce matrix cracks in all constituent plies of the laminates. Helium gas leak rates through the damaged laminates subjected to uniaxial loadings are measured using a helium leak gas detector at room temperature. The effect of intersecting angles of matrix cracks on gas leakage is discussed using the simple leak model based on leak conductance at intersections of matrix cracks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The overall sizing of launch vehicles is of interest, especially when air-breathing is also included. The sizing of a launch vehicle is dictated by the State of Art technologies present and the need to match the challenging demands of high-payload fraction, low cost, and also ensure reliability. This paper presents some of the important design requirements. An ideal velocity approach, which assumes various velocity losses, is generally followed for initial vehicle sizing. However, as this approach is approximate and sometimes incorrect, a new concept of accounting the drag and thrust losses during the atmospheric phase for conventional rockets and air-breathing launch vehicles using scramjet propulsion is evolved complementing the ideal velocity sizing approach. A simplistic two-dimensional trajectory simulation program with graphics for quick interactive design was developed for this purpose. The air-breathing launch vehicle trajectory is split into three flight phases. The sizing of the vehicle considering, especially, the intermediate air-breathing regime is also dealt with. A method to determine the maximum-load envelope expressed in terms of the product of flight dynamic pressure and angle of attack, namely Q-alpha, for all weather launches useful for initial design purposes is also suggested. The design program meant for initial design sizing purposes gives a quick insight on the vehicle performance prior to detailed design with minimum basic vehicle data for conventional rockets and also for air-breathing scramjet vehicles. The various design factors, such as optimum velocity requirement for two stage to orbit vehicles and the sizing requirement of the orbital stage after end of air-breathing phase, are also discussed through representative typical values highlighting the design sensitivities.

ID CUTTING-STOCK PROBLEM; LINEAR-PROGRAMMING APPROACH; ALGORITHM
AB The manifest problem is faced by aerospace firms that produce launch vehicles to shoot satellites into space. The demand for satellites has increased dramatically over the past decade, as both commercial and military applications have grown. Launch vehicles can be built in different sizes, and launch vehicles of a given type have known capacity, cost a known amount to launch, and may be limited in the number or mix of satellites that can be carried into space. Similarly, available satellites can be of different types, and satellites of a given type consume a known amount of a launch vehicle's payload capacity. Given a commitment to shoot a known number of each type of satellite into space over a finite horizon, the objective is to determine the mix of launch vehicles to produce, as well as the assignment of individual satellites to launch vehicles, such that the firm's total cost is minimized. We formulate the launch vehicle manifest problem, and develop and computationally test solution approaches for the problem. Possible applications of the problem and further extensions are discussed.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents a new design methodology for efficient conceptual design of complex systems involving multidisciplinary and computationally intensive analysis with large number of design variables. A nearly-orthogonal sampling of design space is proposed with good space filling properties to extract maximum useful information about system behavior using much lower number of trial designs. This sampled data is then used as training data for artificial neural network, which will act as a metamodel to represent the time consuming disciplinary analyses. A stage-wise interconnection of separate neural networks is also proposed for trajectory metamodel to offset dimensionality curse of neural networks. Genetic Algorithm performs global optimization by utilizing this metamodel and subsequently sequential quadratic programming performs the local optimization utilizing exact analyses. The performance of proposed methodology is investigated in this paper for the conceptual design optimization of multistage solid fueled space launch vehicle. The results show excellent approximation of highly non-linear functions using proposed sampling and drastic reduction in overall design optimization time, due to greatly reduced number of exact disciplinary analyses.

   ATMOSPHERE
AB This paper presents a systematic formulation for the simulation of rigid body dynamics, including the short period dynamics, inherent to stage separation and jettisoning parts of a satellite launcher. This also gives a review of various types of separations involved in a launch vehicle. The problem is sufficiently large and complex; the methodology involves iterations at successively lower levels of abstraction. The best choice to tackle such problems is to use state-of-the-art programming technique known as object oriented programming. The necessary classes have been identified to represent various entities in the launch vehicle separation process (e.g., gravity, aerodynamics, propulsion and separation mechanisms etc.). Simple linkages are modelled with suitable objects. This approach helps the designer to simulate a launch vehicle separation dynamics and also to analyse separation system performance. To examine the influence of the design variables on the separating bodies, statistical analyses have been performed on the upper stage separation process and pull out of ongoing stage nozzle from the spent stage of a multistage rocket carrier using retro rockets.

AB A theoretical analysis of on-line autonomous intelligent adaptive tracking controller based on emotional learning model in mammalians brain (BELBIC) for aerospace launch vehicle is presented. The control algorithm is provided with some sensory inputs and reward signal, subsequently it autonomously seeks the proper control signal to be executed by actuators, thus eliminating tracking error without pre-knowledge of the plant dynamics. The algorithm is very robust and fast in adaptation with dynamical change in the plant, due to its on-line learning ability. Development and application of this algorithm for an aerospace launch vehicle during atmospheric flight in an experimental setting is presented to illustrate the performance of the control algorithm.

AB New developments in materials science in the areas of solution gelation processes and nanotechnology have led to the recent commercial production of aerogels. Concurrent with these advancements has been the development of new approaches to cryogenic thermal insulation systems. For example, thermal and physical characterizations of aerogel beads under cryogenic-vacuum conditions have been performed at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory of the NASA Kennedy Space Center. Aerogel-based insulation system demonstrations have also been conducted to improve performance for space launch applications. Subscale cryopumping experiments show the thermal insulating ability of these fully breathable nanoporous materials. For a properly executed thermal insulation system, these breathable aerogel systems are shown to not cryopump beyond the initial cooldown and thermal stabilization phase. New applications are being developed to augment the thermal protection systems of space launch vehicles, including the Space Shuttle External Tank. These applications include a cold-boundary temperature of 90 K with an ambient air environment in which both weather and flight aerodynamics are important considerations. Another application is a nitrogen-purged environment with a cold-boundary temperature of 20 K where both initial cooldown and launch ascent profiles must be considered. Experimental results and considerations for these flight system applications are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A totally new ignition scheme is proposed, in which the compressed DT main fuel is ignited by impact collision of another fraction of separately imploded DT fuel, which is accelerated in the hollow conical target to hyper-velocities in the order of 10(8) cm/s. Its kinetic energy is directly converted into thermal energy corresponding to temperatures > 5 keV on the collision with the main fuel, and this self-heated portion plays the role of ignitor. The ignitor shell is irradiated typically by nsec-pulses at intensities > 10(15) W/cm(2) and laser wavelength of 0.35 mu m to exert ablation pressures > 100 Mbar. A preliminary two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation shows substantial heating of the compressed core. The impact-shell acceleration and consequent working windows for the beam and target parameters are addressed based on a rocket model. Simple physics, high-energy coupling efficiency, low cost, not needing a PW laser, and affordability of investigation in laboratories under rather well-established physical understanding and experimental know-how are considered to be the notable advantages of the present scheme.

AB The fracture properties of a new ultrahigh strength low alloy steel 0.3C-CrMoV(ESR), developed primarily as a cost effective material for space launch vehicle applications, have been evaluated through two different methods. The steel was processed through electroslag remelting (ESR) with inoculation using niobium to produce 4 tonne ingots, which were forged and rolled into plates. The fracture toughness of this steel has been evaluated by testing compact tension specimens and surface cracked tension specimens following the procedures in ASTM E-399 and ASTM E-740 respectively. The steel, after quenching and tempering, has a 0.2% proof strength of 1470 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1725 MPa and fracture toughness of 96 MPa root m. It has high residual strength also in the presence of surface cracks of 5 x 2 mm size. The microstructure consists of fine grains in the annealed condition and lath martensite in the hardened condition. After tempering, fine carbide precipitates distributed along the lath boundaries and within the laths were observed.

   probability; infancy problems
AB This paper addresses the treatment of `infancy problems' in the reliability analysis of space launch systems. To that effect. we analyze the probability of failure of launch vehicles in their first five launches. We present methods and results based on a combination of Bayesian probability and frequentist statistics designed to estimate the system's reliability before the realization of a large number of launches. We show that while both approaches are beneficial, the Bayesian method is particularly useful when the experience base is small (i.e. for a new rocket). We define reliability as the probability of success based on a binary failure/no failure event WC conclude that the mean failure rates appear to be higher in the first and second flights (approximate to 1/3 and 1/4, respectively) than in subsequent ones (third, fourth and fifth), and Bayesian methods do suggest that there is indeed some difference in launch risk over the first five launches. Yet based on a classical frequentist analysis, we find that for these first few flights, the differences in the mean failure rates over successive launches of over successive generations of vehicles, are not statistically significant (i.e. do not meet a 95% confidence level). This is true because the frequentist analysis is based on a fixed confidence level (here: 95%), whereas the Bayesian one allows more flexibility in the conclusions based on a full probability density distribution of the failure rate and therefore, permits better interpretation of the information contained in a small sample. The approach also gives more insight into the considerable uncertainty in failure rate estimates based on small sample sizes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Bayesian reliability estimation; strategic missile systems; simulation
AB This paper uses a simulation-based approach to compare the predictive accuracy of five different methods for estimating the risk of failure for binary failure/no failure systems such as US strategic missiles, space launch vehicles. and security systems based on the results of a number of tests. This paper tests two Bayesian approaches, two classical (frequentist) approaches. and the method currently used the US Air Force Strategic Command (STRATCOM) to estimate the reliability of strategic nuclear missiles. First, test results are simulated based on an assumed underlying reliability profile. Then the system's reliability is estimated by each of the approaches using the simulated test results, and these estimates are compared with the assumed underlying reliability. Statistical procedures are used to compare the errors from the different methods. The results of this study show that the STRATCOM approach and a classical approach using only the test data from the current period are significantly less accurate than the other three methods and that the accuracy of the Bayesian methods depend on the prior density functions used. The results in this paper provide a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the tested methods. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mission of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes to enable improved prediction of climate. weather. and natural hazards for present and future generations. The ESE has an end-to-end strategy to assure that information. understanding. and capabilities derived from its research program achieve maximum usefulness to the scientific and decision-making communities. Small satellites (< 500 kg) have been crucial contributors to satisfying the research strategy since the inception of NASA's Earth observation program in the 1960s. In the last decade, NASA's ESE has placed a renewed emphasis on small satellites. This reemphasis reflects advancements in compact sensor, small satellite bus. and launch vehicle technologies in addition to management innovations. Near term and advanced planning suggest that this trend will continue. A number of related small satellite missions have been recently launched, are in development. or are planned. Multi-satellite constellations under study include small satellites as key architectural elements. Studies indicate that low cost. capable microspacecraft along with compact sensors and increased autonomy are technology enablers to the sensorwebs and associated distributed spacecraft infrastructure required to realize the long-term NASA Earth Science Vision (ESV).

AB The design of new Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) involves a full set of disciplines - propulsion, structural sizing, aerodynamics, mission analysis, flight control, stages layout - with strong interaction between each other. Since multidisciplinary design optimization of multistage launch vehicles is a complex and computationally expensive. An efficient Least Square Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR) technique is used for trajectory simulation of multistage space launch vehicle. This newly formulation problem-about 17 parameters, linked to both the architecture and the command (trajectory optimization), 8 constraints - is solved through hybrid optimization algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as global optimizer and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) as local optimizer starting from the solution given by (PSO). The objective is to find minimum gross launch weight (GLW) and optimal trajectory during launch maneuvering phase for liquid fueled space launch vehicle (SLV). The computational cost incurred is compared for two cases of conceptual design involving exact trajectory simulation and with Least Square Support Vector Regression based trajectory simulation.

AB The European Agency under its Aurora programme is about to undertake bold and unprecedented steps towards exploring the outer planets of our solar system. A very important step in this programme is a Mars sample return mission lead by the European Space Agency. One main point in this mission is transporting samples from mars with and without humans back to Earth. Transporting these samples and humans from the hostile Mars environment to low Mars orbit and then back to Earth will require some means of transportation based on rockets. In this respect the Surrey Space Centre is exploring alternatives to design a low cost, modular Planetary Ascent Vehicle (PAV). This paper will briefly describe the following:

AB NASA's Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) program is developing and maturing advanced propulsion and vehicle systems technologies and flight vehicle concepts to enable future development of safer and more economical launch systems. Within NGLT, NASA is developing advanced air breathing propulsion systems and demonstrating these systems in hypersonic flight vehicles. The flight demonstrations are necessary to fully validate these technologies for application to future space launch vehicles and other flight systems.
   NASA's Hyper-X Program (X-43A) began the effort to flight demonstrate hypersonic air breathing propulsion systems to provide technologies that will enable development of safer and more economic space access vehicles in the future. Following X-43A, NASA, in collaboration with the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD), is developing additional, progressively more complex hypersonic X-vehicles that will demonstrate new air breathing propulsion systems, propulsion-airframe integration, and other vehicle systems technologies required for high speed flight up to Mach 15. These technologies will contribute to safer, more reliable and more economic future launch systems and hypersonic aircraft/missiles.
   This paper describes NASA's current hypersonic flight demonstration projects, status of the efforts, and plans for future vehicles. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Non-GEO satellites were being hailed as the means that would bring connectivity to the masses. Anyone, it was said, would be able to buy a portable telephone that would allow them, no matter where they might be, to call or be called by anyone else in the world. In the early 1990s, there were predictions that, by now, literally many hundreds of new non-geostationary communications satellites would be in orbit. Furthermore, people all over the world would also be able to buy an inexpensive satellite terminal that would allow them to access the Internet with a broadband connection, at prices on par with or even far below what the terrestrial competition would be able to offer.
   Many companies were set up to compete to establish this "Nirvana of Communications." To do so, however, the companies in question would have to attract sufficient financial backing from investors to actually begin such an undertaking. Surprisingly, at least in retrospect, a tremendous amount of investment capital was forthcoming, and a number of contracts were awarded to manufacturers to develop the requisite satellite systems.
   Today, almost a decade later, satellite manufacturers and their suppliers have been subjected to a massive belt-tightening exercise as contracts were cancelled and expected future orders were not forthcoming. The launch vehicle industry, which had geared up to meet the bonanza of expected launch orders, is also going hungry. Where are all the proposed systems? This paper will attempt to answer this question, as well as to provide some insight into why the systems that are no longer with us fell by the wayside. Finally, it will look into the future and try to predict what the long-term prospects might be for non-GEO communication satellites in general. (C) 2004 Ed Ashford. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Eruca sativa L.; seedlings production; seedlings densitiy; cell size
AB The experiment was realized in Ponta Grossa (PR) aiming at avaluating seedlings density/cells using different trays and its effects on seedlings production and yield of rocket press. The experimental design was a randomised blocks with four replications; the treatments followed a factorial arrangement 4 x 2, being 1, 2, 3 and 4 seedlings/cell on trays with 200 and 288 cells. Seeds were sowed on 28/03/2003, with the cultivar Cultivada on trays with commercial substrate Plantmax under protected cultivation. Before seedlings transplanting it was avaluated the characteristics of leaves number, lenght of upper part and root, fresh and dry weight of up ground material and root. The seedlings transplanting was carried out through with seventeen days in plots containing 40 plants in 0,20 x 0,10 m arrangement. At harvesting, 20 days of the seedlings transplanting, it was avaluated the following characteristics: lenght of upper part, leaves number, fresh and dry weight of up ground material. On the seedlings stage it was observed a significative effect of the interaction. The cell size was an important factor on seedlings production and it depended also on seedlings densities/cell. The best seedlings quality was obtained using trays with 200 cells, compared to 288 cells. Increasing the seedlings density/cell it was observed higher effect of seedlings competition, mainly on trays of 288 cells on the characteristics of leaves number, fresh weight of up ground material and lenght of upper part and root. However these differences were diluted during plants development on the field, being at the harvesting only the characteristic of leaves number still superior on trays of 200 cells (volume of 16 cm(3)) compared to 288 cells (12 cm(3)). On the other hand the seedlings density/cell promoted yield response on rocket press. It was observed linear response on yield. It was observed decreasing on lenght of upper part, leaves number, fresh and dry weight of up ground material, in response of competition pressure among plants promoted by density increasing. However it was observed linear increment on yield/area with the increasing of the seedlings/density. The increment on fresh weight was significative considering yield average of 1,4 kg m(-2) on density of single seedling and 6,4 kg m(-2) when it was used four seedlings/cell. It was observed that when density was increased, higher was the yield on fresh weight to both trays. Considering the commercialization of rocket press mainly on bunch, it seems more interesting a higher density with four seedlings, on trays with 200 or 288 cells.

DE spaceplane design; SSTO; SKYLON; SABRE; airbreathing propulsion
AB SKYLON is a single stage to orbit (SSTO) winged spaceplane designed to give routine low cost access to space. At a gross takeoff weight of 275 tonnes of which 220 tonnes is propellant the vehicle is capable of placing 12 tonnes into an equatorial low Earth orbit. The vehicle configuration consists of a slender fuselage containing the propellant tankage and payload bay with delta wings located midway along the fuselage carrying the SABRE engines in axisymmetric nacelles on the wingtips. The vehicle takes off and lands horizontally on it's own undercarriage. The fuselage is constructed as a multilayer structure consisting of aeroshell, insulation, structure and tankage. SKYLON employs extant or near term materials technology in order to minimise development cost and risk. The SABRE engines have a dual mode capability. In rocket mode the engine operates as a closed cycle liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen high specific impulse rocket engine. In airbreathing mode (from takeoff to Mach 5) the liquid oxygen flow is replaced by atmospheric air, increasing the installed specific impulse 3-6 fold. The airflow is drawn into the engine via a 2 shock axisymmetric intake and cooled to cryogenic temperatures prior to compression. The hydrogen fuel flow acts as a heat sink for the closed cycle helium loop before entering the main combustion chamber.

TI Low cost Mercury orbiter and-sample return missions using solar sail

SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of solar sail propulsion is investigated for both Mercury orbiter (MO) and Mercury sample return missions (MeSR). It will be demonstrated that solar sail propulsion can significantly reduce launch mass and enhance payload mass fractions for MO missions, while MeSR missions are enabled, again with a relatively low launch mass. Previous investigations of MeSR type missions using solar electric propulsion have identified a requirement for an Ariane V launcher to deliver a lander and sample return vehicle. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that, in principle, a MeSR mission can be enabled using a single Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, leading to significant reductions in launch mass and mission costs. Similarly, it will be demonstrated that the full payload of the ESA Bepi Colombo orbiter mission can be delivered to Mercury using a Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, rather than Ariane V, again leading to a reduction in mission costs.

DE axially symmetric solenoid; liquid oxygen (LOX); magnetic force;

AB Current technology for pumping liquid oxygen (LOX)-the corrosive, highly explosive, cryogenic fluid used as the oxidizing agent in many space launch vehicles-involves traditional mechanisms such as impellers and rotors. The moving parts that are in contact with the fluid, as well as the seals around the pump, are potential failure points. These parts require special attention to protect against a reaction with LOX. We have developed a method to use pulsed magnetic fields to pump finite quantities of LOX that requires no moving parts in contact with the fluid. The equipment for this pumping technology is potentially nonintrusive and may be lighter in weight than existing mechanical pumps. Here, we compute equations of motion using a finite-difference technique, predicting the movement of a finite-length column of LOX in response to a pulsed magnetic field. We compare the calculated dynamics to experiment for various configurations.

AB DLR-TUBSAT is a microsatellite joint project of the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Technical University of Berlin (TUB) and the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). It was launched on 26 March 1999 with the Indian Polar Spacecraft Launch Vehicle (PSLV) as secondary payload. DLR-TUBSAT was designed for interactive earth observation where the target is not identified in advance, a search action is involved or a target has to be visually followed. Whereas classical earth observation uses nadir pointing satellites the design of DLR-TUBSAT was made for using interactive control strategies. Since the start of the operation many different strategies for different acquisition and operation modes are developed and tested. A result of this development are new software programs on satellite and ground segment and new ground control procedures. Possible applications of the produced earth observation data could be defined and were integrated in the new control strategies. DLR-TUBSAT showed that it can serve new market areas of earth observation and new customers, which can not use or do not want to use classical earth observation satellites. The main advantages are the interactive search abilities, very high repeat cycles (I day) and the low mass and low costs of the satellite system. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This review presents a general theory of financial crashes and of stock market instabilities that his co-workers and the author have developed over the past seven years. We start by discussing the limitation of standard analyses for characterizing how crashes are special. The study of the frequency distribution of drawdowns, or runs of successive losses shows that large financial crashes are "outliers": they form a class of their own as can be seen from their statistical signatures. If large financial crashes are "outliers", they are special and thus require a special explanation, a specific model, a theory of their own. In addition, their special properties may perhaps be used for their prediction. The main mechanisms leading to positive feedbacks, i.e., self-reinforcement, such as imitative behavior and herding between investors are reviewed with many references provided to the relevant literature outside the narrow confine of Physics. Positive feedbacks provide the fuel for the development of speculative bubbles, preparing the instability for a major crash. We demonstrate several detailed mathematical models of speculative bubbles and crashes. A first model posits that the crash hazard drives the market price. The crash hazard may sky-rocket at some times due to the collective behavior of "noise traders", those who act on little information, even if they think they "know". A second-version inverses the logic and posits that prices drive the crash hazard. Prices may skyrocket at some times again due to the speculative or imitative behavior of investors. According the rational expectation model, this entails automatically a corresponding increase of the probability for a crash. We also review two other models including the competition between imitation and contrarian behavior and between value investors and technical analysts. The most important message is the discovery of robust and universal signatures of the approach to crashes. These precursory patterns have been documented for essentially all crashes on developed as well as emergent stock markets, on currency markets, on company stocks, and so on. We review this discovery at length and demonstrate how to use this insight and the detailed predictions obtained from these models to forecast crashes. For this, we review the major crashes of the past that occurred on the major stock markets of the planet and describe the empirical evidence of the universal nature of the critical log-periodic precursory signature of crashes. The concept of an "anti-bubble" is also summarized, with the Japanese collapse from the beginning of 1991 to present, taken as a prominent example. A prediction issued and advertised in January 1999 has been until recently born out with remarkable precision, predicting correctly several changes of trends, a feat notoriously difficult using standard techniques of economic forecasting. We also summarize a very recent analysis the behavior of the U.S. S&P500 index from 1996 to August 2002 and the forecast for the two following years. We conclude by presenting our view of the organization of financial markets. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is now feasible to construct highly capable 'nanosatellites' (i.e. sub-10 kg satellites) to provide cost-effective and rapid-response orbiting test vehicles for advanced space missions and technologies. The UK's first nanosatellite, SNAP-1-designed and built by Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) staff-is an example of such a test vehicle: in this case, built with the primary objective of demonstrating that a sophisticated, fully agile nanosatellite can be constructed rapidly, and at very low cost, using an extension of the modular-COTS-based design philosophy pioneered by SSC for its microsatellites.
   SNAP-1 was successfully launched into orbit on 28 June 2000 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome on board a Russian Cosmos rocket. It flew alongside a Russian Cospas-Sarsat satellite called Nadezhda, and an SSTL-built Chinese microsatellite, called Tsinghua-1.
   The first year of operations has been highly successful, with SNAP-1 becoming the first nanosatellite to have demonstrated full attitude and orbit control, via its miniature momentum-wheel-based attitude control system and its butane-propellant-based propulsion system. This paper reviews the initial results of the SNAP-1 mission.

AB Aladdin, one of five Concept Study winners for NASA's Discovery A098-OSS-04, was a mission to obtain samples from the two Martian moons using several unique mission design and sample collection techniques. The mission design enabled sample return from two bodies at the relatively low cost of a Discovery-class mission. It featured a phasing orbit, multiple flybys of the Martian moons, and a short overall mission duration. The phasing orbit greatly reduced the post-launch Deltav requirement, thus permitting the use of a Delta II launch vehicle. Multiple moon flybys provided ample opportunities for sample collection and science observations. The short overall mission duration reduced program costs. Aladdin's sample collection, unlike traditional sample collection methods, used a "launch-and-catch" technique to obtain samples. Projectiles would be launched to the moon's surface during a close flyby and the ejected particles gathered for Earth return and analysis. This innovative technique, the Aladdin mission, and the possible extension of the technique to other bodies are described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Mars micromission (MM) spacecraft (MMSC) is a multi-purpose platform capable of orbiting Mars for communications/navigation and science payloads or for precision Mars flybys to drop up to six probes. An MMSC is launched as a secondary payload on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, to GTO using the Ariane 5 structure for auxiliary payloads (ASAP5). The maximum launch wet mass is 222 kg and can include up to 45 kg of payload depending on DeltaV needs. The on-board propulsion system is used for maneuvering in the Earth-Moon system and injecting the spacecraft into Mars transfer orbit and, if needed, Mars orbit. The first MMSC to be launched in early 2003 will be a Communications/Navigation (Comm/Nav) Orbiter. JPL is responsible for the Comm/Nav payload. Ball Aerospace, working with JPL, provides the multi-purpose spacecraft bus, system integration and test, and assists in operations over the 3 year mission duration. This paper summarizes the baseline spacecraft concept for the first Mars Com/Nav mission as defined at the start of the program in February 2000 and describes the spacecraft bus implementation in more detail.

AB Detailed models of combustion instability based on chemistry dynamics are developed. The results show that large activation energy goes against the combustion stability. The heat transfer coefficient between the wall and the combust gas is an important bifurcation parameter for the combustion instability. The acoustics modes of the chamber are in competition and cooperation with each other for limited vibration energy. Thermodynamics criterion of combustion stability can be deduced from the nonlinear thermodynamics. Correlations of the theoretical results and historical experiments indicate that chemical kinetics play a critical role in the combustion instability.

AB Recently, there has been an increased need for evolved space transportation and the research of reusable rocket which enable low cost and high reliability and is generating a lot of interest all over the world. In the USA, the development of reusable launch vehicle "Venture Star" which will be used instead of space shuttle is planned and its half scale model "X-33" was developed for the first flight in 1999. In Japan, there has been agreement on the main points to develop the rocket type RLV based on the technology of H-IIA, HOPE-X before developing space plane type RLV. The planned reusable rocket engine was LOX/LH2 as propellant, has 100-200 ton thrust and has a throttling capability. In addition, long life and high reliability are required for the engine system including LOX/LH2 turbopump.
   The paper introduces some key technologies for the reusable turbopump which IHI is promoting for research and development with NAL and Tohoku University. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB With the new cryogenic upper stage ESC, the European heavy launcher Ariane 5+ is perfectly suited to the space market envisioned for the coming decade: flexible to cope with any payload and commercially attractive despite a fierce competition.
   Current Arianespace projections for the following years 2010-2020 indicate two major trends:
   satellites may still become larger and may require very different final orbits; today's market largely dominated by CEO may well evolve, influenced by LEO operations such as those linked to ISS or by constellations,
   to remain competitive, the launch cost has to be reduced.
   The future generation of the European heavy launcher has therefore to focus on an ever increased flexibility with a drastic cost reduction.
   Two strategies are possible to achieve this double goal:
   reusable launchers, either partially or totally, may ease the access to space, limiting costly expendable stages; the assessment of their technical feasibility and financial viability is undergoing in Europe under the Future Launchers Technology Program (FLTP).
   expendable launchers, derived from the future Ariane 5+.
   This second way started by CNES at the end of year 1999 is called the "Ariane 2010 initiative".
   The main objectives are simultaneously an increase of 25% in performance and a reduction of 30% in launch cost wrt Ariane 5+.
   To achieve these very ambitious goals, numerous major modifications are studied:
   technical improvements
   modifications of the Solid Rocket Boosters may consist in filament winding casing, increased loading, simplified casting, improved grain, simplified Thrust Vector Control, ...
   evolution of the Vulcain engine leading to higher efficiency despite a simplified design, flow separation controlled nozzle extension, propellant management of the two cyrogenic stages,
   simplified electrical system,
   increased standardization, for instance on flanged interfaces and manufacturing processes,
   operational improvements such as launch cycle simplification and standardization of the coupled analyses,
   organizational improvements such as a redistribution of responsibilities for the developments.
   All these modifications will of course not be implemented together; the aim is to have a coherent catalogue of improvements in order to enable future choices depending on effective requirements. These basic elements will also be considered for the development of other launchers, in the small or medium size range. (C) 2001 Bonnal, Eymard, Soccodato-CNES. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID HAMMERHEAD
AB When during the ascent through the Earth's atmosphere the structural response of an aerospace launch vehicle changes from the usually benign case of the buffet response to wind gusts and air turbulence to the self-excited type, the response amplitude increases dramatically and could often endanger the structural integrity of the launch vehicle. This is what occurs when the structural response starts to interact with and modify the unsteady separated Bow characteristics, which generates aerodynamic negative damping or undamping of the low-frequency bending modes. A literature survey has been performed to document how this condition has affected the various aerospace vehicles launched since the early 1960s, The developed analytic means, described in the referenced publications, can predict the worst-case vehicle response with the accuracy needed for preliminary design, provided that sufficiently detailed static aerodynamic data are available, The purpose is to help the design engineer determine whether any of the described Row phenomena that have been experienced by earlier launch vehicles could possibly occur on the new launch vehicle design, in which case the recommended analysis described in full detail in the referenced publications would need to be performed.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

AB The inverse method and the numerical optimization technique are developed and implemented for the design of space launch vehicles, which satisfy given heat transfer rate, fineness ratio and internal volume constraints, and show minimum drag characteristics. With the proper specification of the target pressure distribution, the inverse method is successfully applied to the design of a body with 21% less drag than the initial shape. Several gradient approximations, shape functions, and approximate analysis methods are utilized fur the design of optimum nose fairing shapes with heat flux and volume constraints. Several strategies are implemented to the design examples in hypersonic speeds, including a Korean three-stage sounding rocket, The designed bodies have less drag than the initial bodies while maintaining the surface heat transfer rate at the nose. These methods are demonstrated to be efficient design tools for the high-speed vehicle design.

AB The time has come to give serious thought to the use of the International Space Station (ISS) as a space platform to advance remote sensing research in several scientific disciplines. The European scientific community has been developing instrumentation for deployment on the ISS for some time now. Recently, NASA opened competitions for scientific programs to be supported as "Missions of Opportunity" to utilize the "EXPRESS Pallet" facility on the ISS. A single EXPRESS Pallet has the capability of carrying a collection of instruments similar to the payload of a conventional satellite. A major difference between ISS and satellite programs is that the research funding will be expended on scientific instrumentation and analysis and not on a spacecraft, launch vehicle, and flight operations. As the ISS becomes fully operational, EXPRESS Pallets could be deployed in short periods of time compared to preparing a satellite program. The ability to retrieve, improve, and re-fly an instrument is important to a progressive research program. This allows the experiment to be responsive to data analysis in a timely manner and also keep pace with developing technology. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water vapour concentration is one of the most important, yet one of the least known quantities of the mesosphere. Knowledge of water vapour concentration is the key to understanding many mesospheric processes, including the one that is primary focus of our investigation, Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC). The processes of formation and occurrence parameters of PMC constitute an interesting problem in their own right, but recent evidence had been provided which suggests that PMC are a critical indicator of climate change. In this context the feasibility of a low cost method of water vapour measurements using an instrument carried aloft by a sounding rocket has been examined and some of the results discussed. It is proposed to measure the strength of the 936nm water absorption line in a solar occultation configuration employing a CCD detector. This leads to the design of a small, low cost and low-mass instrument, which can be flown on a small rocket, of the type of the Orbital Sciences Corporation Viper 5. Alternatively the instrument can be flown as a "passenger" on larger rocket carrying other experiments. In either case flight costs are relatively low. Some performance simulations are presented showing that the instrument we have designed will be sufficiently sensitive to measure water vapor in concentrations that are expected at the summer mesopause, about 85 km height. Sufficient payload design work was carried out showing that the structural, thermal and electrical requirements for a flight on the Viper 5 rocket can be met and thus making the experiment feasible for a flight.

AB The US Army Aviation and Missile Command has demonstrated the application of advanced technology to significantly improve the accuracy and range of the US Army's Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) through the Guided MLRS Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The addition of a cost-effective guidance and control package to the rocket results in a weapon system that can defeat the target at ranges up to 70 km with significantly fewer rounds, This not only increases the destructive capability of the system but also reduces the cost of the expended ammunition, the cost to transport the ammunition to the combat zone, and the number of launchers required to execute the mission. The guidance kit is housed in the nose of the MLRS and consists of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), four independent electro-mechanically actuated canards, a Global Position System (GPS) Receiver, GPS antennas, a thermal battery, a guidance computer, and power supply electronics. Roll decoupling of the warhead and motor section was required to allow roll control of the guidance section to enable accurate inertial navigation and was accomplished by joining the two sections with a roll bearing. Five flight missiles were built and tested during the ATD. Two IMU vendors were selected to provide flight units (3 flights used vendor A and 2 flights used vendor B). A tightly coupled eight channel GPS receiver was flown on all flights. This paper discusses the ATD development effort and presents flight test results.
