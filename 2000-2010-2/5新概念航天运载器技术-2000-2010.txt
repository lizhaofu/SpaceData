DT Article
AB An innovative technical solution that overcomes the limitation induced by flow separation phenomena and allows increasing the vacuum-specific impulse of a main stage rocket engine is presented. After reviewing the open technical literature on flow separation and advance nozzles design, the newly proposed concept is extensively presented. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analyses and experimental results (cold gas subscale models) demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple device, adaptable to any bell-shaped nozzle and which provides a solution to the flow separation issue, while increasing vacuum-specific impulse performances for booster and main stage engines. Moreover, this new concept gives rise to a wider engine-throttling range, even at low altitude, without incurring flow separation and associated side loads. Experimental data show a potential for favorable behavior even during transient phases, allowing significant reduction on transient side-loads activity. Finally, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics computations have been extended to the hot tiring case (chemically reactive hydrogen/oxygen propellants), both in steady-state and transient conditions. The results show the suitability of the proposed concept for application to real rocket engines.

   gas jet
AB The water piercing missile launcher (WPML) is a new concept for launching missiles from submerged platforms. The WPML employs a high speed gas jet, using rocket exhaust as the gas source, to create a dry path underwater through which a missile may pass without contacting water. The gas jet is deflected due to cross flow and the gas jet trajectory is computed through a semi-empirical relationship commonly used to describe single phase jet deflection. This relationship, which requires an experimentally determined constant to predict jet deflection, is computed using experimental data. Uncoupled simulations of rocket exhaust and missile dynamics are shown to demonstrate how such a launcher could be utilized in launching a generic artillery missile. Although the results indicate the optimal launch depth, in terms of maximizing the launch depth while minimizing missile restraint time, is 14 m given an 8 m/s submarine speed it may be possible to launch a missile from a moving submarine at a speed of 5 m/s at a maximum depth of 20 m.

TI Effect of different flight conditions at the release of a small
   spacecraft from a high performance aircraft
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Air-launched systems; Trajectory optimization
AB In recent years, mainly due to miniaturization of electronics as well as to the improvement of computer performance, small spacecraft have increased their capabilities. More and more frequently specific mission objectives can be achieved with cheap satellites of reduced size. The growing use of small satellites stimulates the development of systems specifically dedicated to orbit injection of small payloads. In this context, one option is represented by air-launched rockets. The use of an air-launched rocket for delivering a small payload into the desired orbit has several advantages. First of all, payload release is much more flexible, because the delivery conditions are directly related to the dynamics of the aircraft and can be viewed as independent of ground facilities. In addition, reduced costs are associated with higher efficiency of an aircraft in the lower layers of the atmosphere with respect to traditional ground-launched rockets. To date, air-launched rockets separate from the ail-craft in a horizontal flight condition. Then they maneuver in order to achieve the correct flight path angle for injecting into a gravity-turn arc of trajectory. Relevant losses are associated to this pitch maneuver; in addition, in this phase the rocket usually needs an aerodynamic control. Hence, the release of a rocket departing with a high flight path angle from the aircraft would avoid these losses and would simplify the control system, because in such a Situation the pitch maneuver becomes unnecessary: This paper is aimed at investigating the dynamic behavior and performance of a payload delivered from a high performance aircraft, which flies with a high flight path angle. In particular, this work is concerned with showing the differences and tradeoffs among different starting conditions of a multistage air-launched rocket related to several flight path angles of the aircraft at release. An optimal system configuration, which allows placing a micro-satellite into a specified low Earth orbit, is proposed. This configuration is selected by optimizing the release condition, the mass distribution among the stages, and the trajectory (through the determination of the optimal control law).

DE Shock wave interaction; Supersonic air-launching rocket; Supersonic
   separation
AB An analysis was made about the flow characteristics and the rocket motion during supersonic separation of a air-launching rocket from the mother plane. The three-dimensional Euler equations were numerically solved to analyze the steady/unsteady flow fields around the rocket. The simulation results clearly demonstrated the effect of shock-expansion wave interaction between the rocket and its mother plane. A comprehensive analysis showed that the presence of properly designed fins can make the pitch-up motion be more stabilized, and design parameters such as fin size and location of the center of gravity of the rocket are essentially important factors for safe separation. Finally, a guideline about the supersonic air-launching rocket design for safe separation is proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

DE Air-launching rocket; Sequential optimization; System trade study;
   Multi-disciplinary feasible
AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, a comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. For the selection of the best system alternative, a trade study for the first stage engine type and launching speeds is performed using a sequential optimization technique, confirming the feasibility of the baseline air-launching rocket. Then, a system design has been performed using the multi-disciplinary feasible (MDF) design optimization method. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis. configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of multi-disciplinary system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1244.9 kg, total length of 6.36 m, outer diameter of 0.60 m has been successfully designed to launch a satellite of 7.5 kg to the 700 km circular orbit.

AB This paper deals with the problem of the instability regions of a free-free flexible jointed bipartite beam under the follower and transversal forces as a realistic simulation of a two-stage aerospace structure. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of the characteristics of a flexible joint on the beam instability to use maximum bearable propulsion force. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of the stiffness and the location of the joint on the critical follower force by the Ritz method and the Newmark method, then to research the vibrational properties of the structure. It has been shown that the nature of instability is quite unpredictable and dependent on the stiffness and the location of the joint. The increase of the follower force or the transversal force will increase the vibration of the model and consequently cause a destructive phenomenon in the control system of the aerospace structure. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new concept of the parametric approach to analyze the characteristics effects of a flexible two-stage aerospace structure joint design.

AB In order to send the maximum payload to the target orbit using the minimum fuel consumption, the problem of the optimum trajectory in adopting a new concept of laser propulsion to launch the Nano-SAT was studied. The PONTI-LIYATE maximum principle is introduced to analyse the trajectory of the propelled flight phase based on a rocket mode of laser propulsion along the direction of the thrust. The problem of trajectory optimisation was resolved using a mathematic function with a variable flying time and the two point boundary value (TPBV). The method to the problem is verified.

AB The results of a numerical investigation of the forebody strake effects on an air-launched rocket's aerodynamic characteristics at low Mach number and high angles of attack are presented. Forces and moments on a generic rocket that might be used in an air-launch system are predicted using a validated three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code. Asymmetric aerodynamic side forces and yaw moments are observed to occur under certain,conditions with 0-deg sideslip, creating conditions of asymmetry. Forces such as these have been observed experimentally on a variety of aerospace vehicles. The effects of forebody strakes on the aerodynamic side forces and yaw moments are presented for 0-deg sideslip angle of attack. In addition, the sources of the aerodynamic characteristics are described. Results show that the forebody strakes reduce side forces and yaw moments by decreasing the magnitude of the streamline vortical interaction and therefore weakening the asymmetric vortical interactions that cause unstable aerodynamic characteristics.

TI An Overview of Rubber Recycling

DT Article
AB Since the discovery of vulcanisation, rubber has become an indispensable material for the technological development of civilisation, starting from a simple balloon to complex rocket propellant. Rubber Industry worldwide is using on an average 50% of raw materials. These materials are mostly petroleum-based, except natural rubber (NR), steel cord and bead wire. Use of these petroleum-based raw materials not only depletes natural resources, but also produces more extreme environmental hazards. Escalation of petroleum prices, greater awareness of the environment has resulted in different recycling and environmental friendly technologies. Furthermore, the new concept of 'Cradle to Grave' has created a significant concern to the manufacturer about present use of petroleum-based raw materials in the rubber industry worldwide. For both environmental and economic reasons, there is also a continuing broad-based interest in the recycling of scrap rubber and rubber recycled materials and therefore in the development of recycling technologies.

AB The results of a numerical investigation of an air-launched rocket's aerodynamic characteristics at low Mach number and high angle of attack, typical of flight conditions just before engine ignition, are presented. Forces and moments on a generic rocket that might be used in an air-launch system are predicted using a validated 3-D Navier-Stokes code. Aerodynamic side and yaw forces are observed to occur under certain conditions with zero degrees sideslip, creating conditions of asymmetric side and yaw forces. Forces such as these have been observed experimentally on a variety of aerospace vehicles. The effects of engine,thrust on the aerodynamic side and yaw forces are presented. In addition, the sources of the aerodynamic characteristics under engine-off/on conditions are described. Results chow that the nozzle flow from the engine reduces side forces and yaw moments by decreasing separated flow and therefore weakening the asymmetric vortical interactions that cause unstable aerodynamic characteristics.

DT Article
DE launch vehicle design; air-breathing vehicle sizing; trajectory design
   sizing program; launch vehicle performance
AB The overall sizing of launch vehicles is of interest, especially when air-breathing is also included. The sizing of a launch vehicle is dictated by the State of Art technologies present and the need to match the challenging demands of high-payload fraction, low cost, and also ensure reliability. This paper presents some of the important design requirements. An ideal velocity approach, which assumes various velocity losses, is generally followed for initial vehicle sizing. However, as this approach is approximate and sometimes incorrect, a new concept of accounting the drag and thrust losses during the atmospheric phase for conventional rockets and air-breathing launch vehicles using scramjet propulsion is evolved complementing the ideal velocity sizing approach. A simplistic two-dimensional trajectory simulation program with graphics for quick interactive design was developed for this purpose. The air-breathing launch vehicle trajectory is split into three flight phases. The sizing of the vehicle considering, especially, the intermediate air-breathing regime is also dealt with. A method to determine the maximum-load envelope expressed in terms of the product of flight dynamic pressure and angle of attack, namely Q-alpha, for all weather launches useful for initial design purposes is also suggested. The design program meant for initial design sizing purposes gives a quick insight on the vehicle performance prior to detailed design with minimum basic vehicle data for conventional rockets and also for air-breathing scramjet vehicles. The various design factors, such as optimum velocity requirement for two stage to orbit vehicles and the sizing requirement of the orbital stage after end of air-breathing phase, are also discussed through representative typical values highlighting the design sensitivities.

AB We introduce the new concept of "proper speed". It turns out that relativistic space flight can be sized and described more adequately by this concept. In particular, it is shown that the physics and equations of relativistic and classical space flight have a one-to-one relationship. The rocket equations are even identical. In addition, we generalize the expressions for the rocket exhaust speed to systems with mass and/or photon propulsion. With this new insight the basic relativistic spaceflight are easily derived and summarized and it is shown that they can be readily transformed into those of classical space flight. We also provide the space-time transformation equations for a cruising rocket, for a rocket with constant acceleration, and for a rocket with constant thrust (with and without inflight thrust reversal to slow down to zero speed at the target). For each of these cases a representative flight through the milky way with a ultimate matter-antimatter annihilation drive is calculated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the development and flight testing ora new air-launch method for safely launching personnel and cargo into low Earth orbit (LEO). A new rocket is also being designed that will be,carried by and launched using the new air-launch method from a modified 747 airliner. This new air-launch method, called trapeze-lanyard air drop (t/LAD) launch, will greatly improve simplicity, safety, cost, and reliability of launching personnel into LEO. A t/LAD launch eliminates the need for wings or fins on the launch vehicle; greatly reduces ascent,dynamic pressure, sideways accelerations and bending forces, and rocket engine thrust vectoring control; and allows the use of a simple and very safe vapor pressurization (Vapak) engine cycle for the launch vehicle. This paper reports on the flight-test results of dropping three,23%-scale drop test articles using,the t/LAD launch method.

AB This paper presents an approach to space transportation turnaround operations modeling using knowledge based complexity functions. This project is of significant relevance to the field of industrial engineering as it deals with knowledge based estimation of processing operations based on the design characteristics of an extremely complex product. The modeling approach uses expert's knowledge to predict the ground cycle time and costs of a new concept launch vehicle by functions that estimate the complexity and reliability of the system based on its design characteristics. The operational requirements include the interactions between the launch vehicle and its ground infrastructure: the spaceport. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation of the modeling concept into a tool called Architecture Assessment Tool - enhanced (AATe) used by NASA and its contractors.
   Significance: It is imperative that space transportation systems be analyzed in the very earliest of design to ensure all life cycle costs are considered. This paper presents an approach to the operational cost and time modeling of these systems by knowledge based complexity functions and the importance of this assessment using the concept of total design.

AB A numerical analysis is made of the supersonic separation of air-launching rocket from the mother plane. Three-dimensional Enter equations have been numerically solved to capture details of steady/unsteady flow fields and transient behavior of the launching rocket during separation stage. Various types of interaction between shock and expansion waves are clarified with concomitant effects on the separation process. As extracting important design factors, which have major influences on the stability of separation, a guideline on the design of supersonic air-launching rocket is given.

TI A concept of guidance for an air-launch vehicle with compensation of
   initial downrange and launch time errors at direct insertion into a
   rendezvous point in the orbit
SO COSMIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A flying launcher (airplane carrier) can generate initial errors in position and time of launch. In order to compensate for these errors, one should have two control parameters in addition to those that provide for a spacecraft's injection into a preset orbit. We suggest the concept of controlling the trajectory of injection by choosing thrust values (within allowable regions of control) of second-stage engines or/and of a space booster of the Polyot carrier launcher. As an example, a rendezvous of the spacecraft at the end of its boost phase with the International Space Station (ISS) is considered. The methodology of the suggested approach can be extended to other mobile systems of launch to rendezvous orbits.

AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. Given mission objective is to launch 7.5kg nano-satellite to the target orbit of 700km x 700kni using the mother plane, F-4E Phantom. The launching altitude and velocity are 12km, Mach number 1.5, respectively. As the propulsion system, a hybrid rocket engine is used for the first stage, and the solid rocket motors are used for the second and third stages. The total mass, length and diameter constraints of the rocket are imposed by the mother plane. The system design has been performed using the sequential optimization method. Gradient based SQP(Sequential Quadratic Programming) algorithm is employed. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis, configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1272.61kg, total length of 6.43m, outer diameter of 0.60 m and the payload mass of 7.5kg has been successfully designed.

TI Computational analysis of an independent ramjet stream in a combined
   cycle engine
SO AIAA JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SCHEME
AB A new concept for the low-speed propulsion mode in rocket-based combined cycle engines has been developed as part of the NASA GTX program. This concept, called the independent ramjet stream (IRS) cycle, is a variation of the traditional ejector ramjet (ER) design and involves the injection of hydrogen fuel directly into the airstream, where it is ignited by the rocket plume. The advantage of the IRS design is that it allows for a single large rocket instead of several smaller rockets, and its required combustor length is smaller than that of a traditional ER design. Both of these features make the IRS design lighter. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics are currently being used to evaluate the feasibility of the new design. In this work, a Navier-Stokes code valid for general reactive flows is applied to the model engine under cold-flow, ER, and IRS cycle operation. Pressure distributions corresponding to cold-flow and ER operation are compared with experimental data. The engine response under IRS cycle operation is examined for different reaction models and grid sizes. The solutions exhibit a high sensitivity to both grid resolution and reaction mechanism but do indicate that thermal throat ramjet operation is possible through the injection and burning of additional fuel into the airstream.
