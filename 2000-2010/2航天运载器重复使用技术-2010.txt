AB The Indian Space programme took birth on November 21, 1963, with the launch of Nike-Apache, an American sounding rocket from the shores of Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram on the west coast of India. From a family of operational Sounding rockets known as the Rohini Sounding Rockets, India's launch vehicles have now grown Lip through SLV-3 and Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) to the current gigantic satellite launchers, PSLV and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Though we had failures in the initial launches of SLV-3, ASLV and PSLV, these failures gave Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) a thorough and in depth understanding of the nuances Of launch vehicle technology that later led to Successful missions. An entirely new dimension was added to the Indian space programme when a space capsule was recovered very precisely after it had orbited the Earth for 12 days. The future for launch vehicles in ISRO looks bright with the GSLV MKIII, Which is Currently under development and the pursuit Of Cutting edge technologies Such as reusable launch vehicles and air-breathing propulsion.

AB In this paper, a characteristic model based longitudinal control design for the trans-aerosphere vehicle X-34 in its transonic and hypersonic climbing phase is proposed. The design is based on the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and the curves it is to track in this climbing phase. Through a detailed analysis of the aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics during this climbing phase, an explicit description of the tracking curve for the flight path angle is derived. On the basis of this tracking curve, the tracking curves for the two short-period variables, the angle of attack and the pitch rate, are designed. An all-coefficient adaptive controller is then designed, based on the characteristic modeling, to cause these two short-period variables to follow their respective tracking curves. The proposed design does not require multiple working points, making the design procedure simple. Numerical simulation is performed to validate the performance of the controller. The simulation results indicate that the resulting control law ensures that the vehicle climbs up successfully under the restrictions on the pitch angle and overloading.

LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the study of a concept of Ariane-5 evolution by means of replacement of two solid-propellant boosters EAP with two liquid-propellant reusable fly-back boosters (RFBBs) called "Bargouzine". The main design feature of the reference RFBB is LOX/LH2 propellant, the canard aerodynamic Configuration with delta wings and rocket engines derived from Vulcain-2 identical to that of the central core except for the nozzle length. After separation RFBBs return back by use of air breathing engines mounted in the aft part and then landing on a runway.
   The aim of the study is a more detailed investigation of critical technology issues concerning reliability, re-usability and maintenance requirements. The study was performed in three main phases: system trade-off, technical consolidation, and programmatic synthesis. The system trade-off includes comparative analysis of two systems with three and four engines on each RFBB and determination of the necessary thrust level taking into account thrust reservation for emergency Situations. Besides, this phase contains trade-off on booster aerodynamic Configurations and abort scenario analysis.
   The second phase includes studying of controllability during the ascent phase and separation, thermo-mechanical design, development of ground interfaces and attachment means, and turbojets engine analysis taking into account reusability. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a novel fuzzy tracking control method, which is used for the reentry attitude tracking problem of a reusable launch vehicle. Based on Takagi-Stigeno fuzzy description of reentry attitude dynamics, the tracking error of attitude angles is studied. Without the need of an augmented system, exponential stability of the tracking error can be obtained by a fuzzy feedforward controller. In addition, to achieve a good tracking performance, H infinity and decay rate eta control methods are considered. The solutions to the robust fuzzy tracking control problem can be obtained by applying linear matrix inequalities and fuzzy logic controller tools. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID GUIDANCE; DESIGN
AB A major objective of next generation reusable launch vehicle (RLV) programs includes significant improvements in vehicle safety, reliability, and operational costs. In this paper, novel approaches that can deliver an RLV to its landing site safely and reliably are proposed. Trajectory generation on approach/landing (A&L) for RLVs using motion primitives (MPs) and neighboring optimal control (NOC) is first discussed. In this stage, the proposed trajectory generation approach is based on an MP scheme that consists of trims and maneuvers. From an initial point to a given touchdown point, all feasible trajectories that satisfy certain constraints are generated and saved into a trajectory database. An optimal trajectory can then be found off-line by using Dijkstra's algorithm. If a vehicle failure occurs, perturbations are imposed on the initial states of the off-line optimal trajectory, and it is reshaped into a neighboring feasible trajectory on-line by using an NOC approach. If the perturbations are small enough, a neighboring feasible trajectory existence theorem (NFTET) is then investigated and its proof is provided as well. The approach given in the NFTET shows that a vehicle with stuck effectors can be recovered from failures in real time. However, when the perturbations become large, for example, in severe failure scenarios, the NFTET is no longer applicable and often the vehicle cannot be recovered from such failures. A new method is then used to deal with this situation. The NFTET is now extended to the trajectory robustness theorem (TRT). According to the TRT and its proof, a robustifying term is introduced to compensate for the effects of the linear approximation in the NFTET. The upper bounds with respect to input deviation are adaptively adjusted to eliminate their uncertainty. In order to obtain best performance, sigma-modification is employed. The simulation results verify the excellent robust performance of this method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed analysis methods are applied and tested on an industrial-standard simulation model of a reusable launch vehicle equipped with a full authority nonlinear dynamic inversion-based flight control law. The reliability, computational complexity and efficiency of the framework are evaluated against standard industrial approaches based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results of the study show that the proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and efficiency of the flight clearance process for future reusable launch vehicles.

AB A single-stage launch vehicle equipped with a combustible tank shell of polyethylene and a moving propulsion plant is proposed. The propulsion plant is composed of a chamber for the gasification of the shell, a compressor of pyrolysed polyethylene and a magnetic powder obturator. It is shown that the "dental" structure of the gasification chamber is necessary to achieve the necessary contact area with the polyethylene shell. This conclusion is drawn from consideration of the thermophysical proper-ties of polyethylene, calculating quasisteady temperature field in the gasification chamber, estimating gasification rate of polyethylene, launch vehicle shortening rate and area of gasification. Experimental determination of the gasification rate is described. The gasification chamber specific mass as well as the propulsion plant weight-to-thrust ratio are estimated under some assumptions concerning the obturator and compressor. Combustible launch vehicles are compared with conventional launch vehicles taking into consideration their payload mass ratios. Combustible launchers are preferable as small launchers for micro and nano satellites. Reusable versions of such launchers seem suitable if polyethylene tank shells filled with metal or metal hydride fine dusts are used.

AB This paper presents a partially reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle concept for delivering 65 metric ton payloads to low Earth orbit. A winged booster and an expendable core stage each use identical main propulsion, thrust structure, and propellant feed systems. For both stages, four 745,000 lbf thrust, RS-68 oxygen/hydrogen rocket engines, presently used on the Delta-IV launch vehicle, are used. The booster, which does not require reentry thermal protection, ascends to a Mach 2.4,81,000 ft altitude condition, separates from the core stage, and glides back to a runway landing. Sixty-five metric tons in orbit would be enabling to a variety of exploration missions, including very large telescope emplacement missions, robust outer planet missions, and others requiring large payload masses or volumes. Use of a reusable booster, designed for maintainability and affordability, would, in combination with an expendable core using common propulsion, allow for significant reductions in recurring costs compared with a totally expendable vehicle with similar payload capabilities.

AB A multitude of inter-disciplinary technologies have been mastered indigenously for realizing a series of operational space launch vehicles. The vehicles range from relatively tiny Rohini sounding rockets to gigantic satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV. These vehicles now launch on demand, the entire IRS range of remote sensing satellites and communication satellites up to 2.5 tonnes, providing precise orbital injection. This article presents the evolution of the technologies, various major subsystems and their validation methodologies for these satellite launch vehicles of ISRO. An attempt has been made to present the conceptual foundations of the entire range of the accomplishments. The paper also includes a brief description of the facilities at the launch complex of ISRO. It delineates briefly the plans for developments in the near future in respect of reusable launch vehicles, and advanced facilities.

AB The paper concerns possible concept variants of a partially reusable Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicle derived from the advanced basic launcher (Ariane-2010) by means of substitution of the EAP Solid Rocket Boosters for a Reusable Starting Stage consisting two Liquid-propellant Reusable Fly-Back Boosters called "Bargouzin". This paper describes the status of the presently studied RFBB concepts during its three phases. The first project phase was dedicated to feasibility expertise of liquid-rocket reusable fly-back boosters ("Baikal" type) utilization for heavy-lift space launch vehicle. The design features and main conclusions are presented. The second phase has been performed with the purpose of selection of preferable concept among the alternative ones for the future Ariane LV modernization by using RFBB instead of EAP Boosters. The main requirements, logic of work, possible configuration and conclusion are presented. Initial aerodynamic, ballistic, thermoloading, dynamic loading, trade-off and comparison analysis have been performed on these concepts. The third phase consists in performing a more detailed expertise of the chosen LV concept. This part summarizes some of the more detailed results related to flight performance, system mass, thermoprotection system, aspects of technologies, ground complex modification, comparison analyses and conclusion.

AB NiCrAlY top coats are currently being considered as environmental protective coatings for copper alloy liners in rocket engine combustion chambers of reusable launch vehicles. The microstructure and mechanical properties of this top coat sprayed on GRCop-84 have been characterized as a function of thermal cycling between 298 and 873 K and no obvious degradation was observed. Interfacial microsample tensile tests developed to measure coating adhesion to the substrate revealed that the interfaces were stronger than the substrate in both the as-received and thermal cycled conditions. Finite element modeling was used to analyze the stresses in the microsamples and verify the strength of the interfaces. The formation of depleted zones, devoid of Cr2Nb particles, was associated with plasma arc cleaning in a minority of the samples prepared for this study, and the presence of these depleted zones has been found to significantly decrease the adhesion of the NiCrAlY coating and to change the failure mode in thermal cycled specimens.

AB The effect of anatase, rutile, and amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles on the combustion of solid rocket propellant was investigated. Each additive increased the burning rate of propellant strands by 30%. Typical fast-burning propellants are unstable due to oversensitivity to pressure variations, but the anatase additive yielded propellants with high yet stable burning rates over a broad pressure range. Anatase nanoparticles also catalyzed the high-temperature decomposition of ammonium perchlorate, a key component of solid propellant.

AB Using a wide spectrum of completed air-breathing and rocket-powered launch vehicle baseline configurations, an assessment was undertaken to ascertain each vehicle system's scaling response to empty weight growth. To establish the growth behavior, each vehicle's baseline solution was modified for percentage increases or decreases in the baseline empty weight from +10 % to -10 %, after which each vehicle system was then re-solved. The identification of the trends in these solutions enabled the determination of the growth factor for each vehicle configuration. The growth factor characterizes the system's sensitivity to changes in structural weight arising from technological uncertainty. Systems with high growth factors represent a greater amount of design risk because they may rapidly scale out of control if expected technology levels fail to materialize. This understanding may also be applied to measure the extent of improvements possible from application of more advanced technology. Several other figures of merit were also used to evaluate the growth solutions, including empty weight, wetted area, and gross weight. The assessment concluded that single-stage air breathers have a higher response to weight uncertainty than two-stage configurations with the horizontal takeoff mode being more sensitive than vertical takeoff. Two-stage air-breathing configurations, whereas exhibiting lower growth factors, differed greatly from each other in total empty weight across the growth cases with the vertical takeoff mode roughly half the weight of comparable horizontal takeoff configurations. Two-stage reusable rocket configurations also show low scaling weight growth factors and empty weights and are relatively insensitive to small percentage growth changes.

AB A method for the implementation of integrated three-degree-of-freedom constrained entry guidance for reusable launch vehicle is presented. Given any feasible entry conditions, terminal area energy management interface conditions, and the reference trajectory generated onboard then, the method can generate a longitudinal guidance profile rapidly, featuring linear quadratic regular method and a proportional-integral-derivative tracking law with time-varying gains, which satisfies all the entry corridor constraints and meets the requirements with high precision. Afterwards, by utilizing special features of crossrange parameter, establishing bank-reversal corridor, and determining bank-reversals according to dynamically adjusted method, the algorithm enables the lateral entry guidance system to fly a wide range of missions and provides reliable and good performance in the presence of significant aerodynamic modeling uncertainty. Fast trajectory guidance profiles and simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various missions and aerodynamic uncertainties are presented to demonstrate the capacity and reliability of this method.

AB Allocation of control authority among redundant control effectors, under hard constraints, is an important component of the inner loop of a reentry vehicle guidance and control system. Whereas existing control allocation schemes generally neglect actuator dynamics, thereby assuming A static relationship between control surface deflections and moments about a three-body axis, in this work a dynamic control allocation scheme is developed that implements a form, of model-predictive control. In the approach proposed here, control allocation is posed as a sequential quadratic programming problem with constraints, which can also be cast into a linear complementarity problem and therefore solved in a finite number of iterations. Accounting directly for nonnegligible dynamics of the actuators with hard constraints, the scheme extends existing algorithms by providing asymptotic tracking of time-varying input commands for this class of applications. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a high-fidelity simulation for an experimental reusable launch vehicle is used, in which, results are compared with those of static control allocation schemes in situations of actuator failures.

AB A new guidance scheme has been developed for the terminal phase of an unpowered reusable launch vehicle that has known limited bank capabilities. Reduced bank angle magnitude may be the result of actuator failures, and in such cases a vehicle will have difficulty performing the required heading change before approach and landing. A vertical guidance law controls dynamic pressure, and attempts to track the minimum dynamic pressure boundary to extend the ground track and maximize the turning rate. Lateral guidance uses a bank reversal to widen the turn radius and spiral in to a heading-alignment circle. The guidance algorithm iterates on two parameters (bank-reversal switch time and heading-alignment circle location), and selects the best values by propagating several trajectories to the desired approach and landing energy state. The effectiveness of the guidance algorithm is demonstrated by several numerical simulations, which show that the guided vehicle is able to successfully reach the desired approach and landing interface state with bank limitations as low as 18 deg.

AB In composite structures understanding and quantifying the existence of residual stresses is a very important issue. The presence of these residual stresses can lead to unexpected failure of structures as seen in the fuel tank of the X-33 reusable launch vehicle. A study into the development of residual stresses as a function of temperature was performed to help provide insight into this situation. A recently developed optical technique, the cure reference method, and a modification of traditional strain gage techniques were used in this pursuit. Diffraction gratings and strain gages were applied to IM7/977-2 composite panels of differing stacking sequences. Strains were measured under no load while temperature was varied. Consequently stresses developed between the plies and a method to calculate them was proposed. Residual stress levels were dependent on stacking sequence and quasi-isotropic laminates perform poorly when exposed to cryogenic temperatures. Laminates should be optimized to account for both mechanical and thermal loading. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE reusable launch vehicle; parametric cost modelling; launch system
   economics
AB A successful reusable launch vehicle (RLV) will need to launch payloads at lower prices than competing expendable launch vehicles (ELVs). Existing ELVs have the advantage of written off development costs, and support a range of payload sizes through dual launch and launcher modularity - features not expected to be shared by an RLV. However, the majority of ELV launch costs are expendable hardware, while for RLVs many costs are fixed annual costs. Starting with a per-flight cost below that of competing ELVs, an RLV can support a range of payload sizes at a fixed cost[kg. Since the cost of adding an extra flight to the annual operations ("marginal cost") is also very much less than the "full recovery" cost, it is possible to extend the range of economic payload sizes downwards. This can provide the customer with a flexible, constant specific cost launcher, while giving the operator a strategy allowing recovery of the development and initial fleet production costs. An estimate for the probability distribution of future payloads (to LEO, GTO and polar orbits) is presented. This can then be used to optimize the vehicle market capture to maximise the operator's profit, or to identify a minimum market size for which an RLV will be profitable.

DE space tourism; reusable launch vehicle; parametric cost modelling
AB In comparison with other large scale Space projects, "Space Tourism" requires only one development - a suitable, economic, Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). The high flight rates associated with "tourism" are expected to make RLV operations more economically attractive. However, currently projected RLV launch prices appear well above those affordable by tourists. A study of the economics of Space Tourism has been made using an Integrated Parametric System Model to assess potential future RLV performance and costs. The estimated costs per passenger for "first generation" RLVs are still above estimates for an acceptable market price per ticket, but are not an order of magnitude different. Technology improvements, particularly engine technology, can be expected to make reductions in the ticket cost. Repayment of non-recurring (development) costs can form up to 50% of the costs per flight, but an initial market might be started using "second hand" vehicles developed for other purposes. Finally, the slow but steady growth of "real income" over an extended period can be expected to make what are now unaffordable prices for a ride into orbit more affordable in 20 - 30 years time.

AB The Phoenix vehicle was designed to flight demonstrate the automatic and unpowered horizontal landing of a representative, winged reusable launch vehicle. The shape of the test vehicle was derived from the suborbital reusable launch vehicle concept Hopper. Three automatic landing tests were completed successfully in May 2004. Methods of system identification were applied to the. flight data to evaluate the performance and to improve the design models and databases for future applications. A specific emphasis was placed on the evaluation of the onboard navigation system, air data sensor, aerodynamic model, landing gear effects and ground-roll characteristics. This paper gives a brief overview of the Phoenix mission and elaborates on the flight data analysis and of the preceding wind-tunnel campaigns, to allow a comparison of results from different approaches.

AB The nation's goals to replace the aging Space Shuttle fleet and pursue exploration of our solar system and beyond will require more robust, less costly launch vehicles and spacecraft. This paper presents a novel sliding mode control approach, sliding mode control driven by sliding mode disturbance observers with gain adaptation, for a reusable launch vehicle flight control system design as a way to improve robustness to many phenomena such as modeling uncertainties and disturbances, while retaining continuity of control without using high control gains. Because of the robustness to external disturbances and modeling uncertainties, the proposed flight control system design also can reduce cost by requiring less time in design cycle and preflight analyses. This design is applied to terminal area energy management and approach/landing. The multiple-loop flight controller design features low-order disturbance observers that rely only on knowledge of the bounds of the disturbance. A gain-adaptation algorithm is included in the disturbance observer design that provides the least gain needed for existence of the sliding mode. Six degree-of-freedom computer simulations of the X-33 technology demonstration suborbital reusable launch vehicle for nominal and severe wind-gust tests demonstrate improved performance over a more conventional, classical control system design.

AB Three multilevel multidisciplinary optimization techniques, Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, Collaborative Optimization, and Modified Collaborative Optimization, are applied to the design of a reusable launch vehicle, evaluated, and compared in this study. In addition to comparing the techniques against each other, they are also compared with designs reached via fixed-point iteration of disciplines with local optimization and the industry accepted multidisciplinary optimization technique, All-at-Once. The new multidisciplinary optimization techniques, particularly Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis, showed greater ability than fixed-point iteration to design for a global objective and were more applicable to complex systems than All-at-Once. This study was the first time that the novel multidisciplinary optimization methods were compared qualitatively and quantitatively under controlled experimentation practices. It is still impossible to statistically determine whether any one of the novel multidisciplinary optimization techniques is better than another, because more studies using different test problems corroborating the conclusions made here are needed.

AB This article presents the real-time strain measurement of a composite liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The tank was composed of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), and an aluminum liner was fabricated by the filament winding method and mounted on a reusable rocket, This rocket (vertical takeoff and landing) is called a reusable rocket vehicle test (RVT) and was developed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (ISAS/JAXA). Considering the high operational pressure and the iterative use of the tank, its structural integrity must be guaranteed. Thus, the authors have attempted a real-time strain measurement of the composite LH2 tank using FBG sensors during rocket operations. First, the adhesive properties of the FBG sensors were investigated at cryogenic temperatures. As a result, UV-coated FBG sensors and polyurethane adhesives were adopted. An onboard FBG demodulator was then developed to be mounted on the rocket and its performance was assessed. Finally, the strain measurement was attempted during the flight experiments of the RVT using the onboard FBG demodulator. FBG sensors were glued on the surface of the composite LH2 tank and connected to the onboard FBG demodulator. During these rocket operations, the output of the onboard FBG demodulator was continuously monitored via a telemetry system. The results obtained by the demodulator agreed well with those of the conventional foil strain gage.

AB A conceptual design study was performed to assess and compare the parameters of two-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch-vehicle systems in an effort to identify optimal configurations for improved access to space. The following vehicle configuration categories were considered: horizontal takeoff ramjet-scramjet boosters with upper-stage reusable rockets, horizontal takeoff turbine boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages, and vertical takeoff rocket boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages. Ramjet-scramjet upper stages utilize integrated rockets for final orbital ascent. Ramjet-scramjet booster stages make use of either integrated turbines or rockets for takeoff and acceleration to ramjet start. The payload requirement for each vehicle system is 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile low Earth orbit. The vehicle solutions were-evaluated utilizing several figures of merit including empty weight, wetted area, actively cooled area, gross weight, staging considerations, and design and technology traceability to future development of single-stage-to-orbit hypersonic airbreathing vehicles. The application of these criteria to the closed vehicle solutions reveals that the vertically launched rocket booster with an upper-stage ramjet-scramjet is the best two-stage airbreathing launch vehicle configuration. Of all of the two-stage vehicles investigated, those which place the hypersonic propulsion elements as part of the upper stage surpass those with first-stage placement and exhibit more design traceability with single-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch vehicles.

DE optimization; launcher; trajectory
AB Launcher trajectory optimization is a complex task, especially when considering the specific problems arising in the study of reusable launch vehicles. Part of the difficulty comes from the different characteristics of the trajectory arcs which make up the vehicle's mission (constraints and controls may not be the same). Another difficulty is the necessity, in some cases, of a global optimization between ascent and re-entry phases (branching optimisation). Finally, optimization tools devoted to this task should be polyvalent and robust, as the studies of reusable launch vehicles usually cover many different concepts, and also many different trajectory cases (such as abort scenarios). The purpose of this paper is to present different approaches used in France by CNES and ONERA to solve optimal control problems in the context of launcher trajectory optimization. These approaches, which are powerful implementations of classical optimization methods, were designed to cover the needs for both expendable and reusable launchers trajectory calculation. The first optimization tool presented is OPTAX, which uses an indirect shooting method. The second and third tools presented are CNES's ORAGE and ONERNs FLOP/OLGA, which use two different variants of the gradient method. The paper describes the equations and methodology behind these tools, and also presents their advantages and drawbacks. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Long-term/strategic scenario for reusable booster stages
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
AB This paper describes the final design status of a partially reusable space transportation system which has been under study for five years within the German future launcher technology research program ASTRA. It consists of dual booster stages, which are attached to an advanced expendable core. The design of the reference liquid fly-back boosters (LFBB) is focused on LOX/LH2 propellant and a future advanced gas-generator cycle rocket motor. The preliminary design study was performed in close cooperation between DLR and the German space industry. The paper's first part describes recent progress in the design of this reusable booster stage.
   The second part of the paper assesses a long-term, strategic scenario of the reusable stage's operation. The general idea is the gradual evolution of the above mentioned basic fly-back booster vehicle into three space transportation systems performing different tasks: Reusable First Stage for a small launcher application, successive development to a fully reusable TSTO, and booster for a super-heavy-lift rocket to support an ambitious space flight program like manned Mars missions. The assessment addresses questions of technical sanity, preliminary sizing and performance issues and, where applicable, examines alternative options. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multiphysics simulations are playing an increasingly important role in computational science and engineering for applications ranging from aircraft design to medical treatments. These simulations require integration of techniques and tools from multiple disciplines, and in turn demand new advanced technologies to integrate independently developed physics solvers effectively. In this paper, we describe some numerical, geometrical, and system software components required by such integration, with a concrete case study of detailed, three-dimensional, parallel rocket simulations involving system-level interactions among fluid, solid, and combustion, as well as subsystem-level interactions. We package these components into a software framework that provides common-refinement based methods for transferring data between potentially non-matching meshes, novel and robust face-offsetting methods for tracking Lagrangian surface meshes, as well as integrated support for parallel mesh optimization, remeshing, algebraic manipulations, performance monitoring, and high-level data management and I/O. From these general, reusable framework components we construct domain-specific building blocks to facilitate integration of parallel, multiphysics simulations from high-level specifications that are easy to read and can also be visualized graphically. These reusable building blocks are integrated with independently developed physics codes to perform various multiphysics simulations.

AB A design study was performed to define and compare the parameters of horizontal- and vertical-takeoff reusable launch-vehicle systems to identify promising configurations for further developmental emphasis. The investigation considered both two-stage rockets and single-stage airbreathing ramjet/scramjet-powered vehicles, thus representing next-generation and third-generation configurations, respectively. The payload requirement for each vehicle was 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile circular Earth orbit launched easterly from Kennedy Space Center. All vehicles were first analyzed using liquid hydrogen for the entire trajectory and then reanalyzed with liquid hydrocarbon fuel for the first stage, if a rocket, or for the low-speed trajectory segment to ramjet start for the airbreathers. The vertical-takeoff airbreathing vehicles were found to have the lowest empty weights and gross takeoff weights of all of the vehicle configurations, with three-dimensional inward-turning inlets outperforming two-dimensional inlets, and the use of hydrocarbon fuel outperforming hydrogen fuel for the launch propulsive segment to ramjet start. The best horizontal takeoff vehicle is the all-hydrogen inward-turning airbreather. For the two-stage rockets, the lightest empty weight was achieved with the use of hydrocarbon fuel in the booster and hydrogen fuel in the orbiter.

AB This simulation involved a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of a full-motor initial grain of the reusable solid rocket motor of the Space Transportation System. It was conducted with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) commercial code FLUENT (R). This analysis was performed to maintain continuity, with most related previous analyses; serve as a nonvectored baseline for any three-dimensional vectored nozzles; provide a relatively simple application and test for various CFD solution schemes, grid sensitivity studies, turbulence modeling, and heat transfer; and calculate nozzle convective heat transfer coefficients. The theoretical prediction of turbulent convective heat transfer in supersonic nozzles is scarce and challenging. The accuracy of the present results and the selection of the numerical schemes and turbulence models were based on matching the rocket ballistic predictions of mass flow rate, head end pressure, measured chamber pressure drop and vacuum thrust, and specific impulse. The matching for these ballistic predictions was found to be good. This study was limited to convective heat transfer and the results compared favorably with some of the methods cited. Good agreement with the backed-out data of the ratio of the convective heat transfer coefficient to the specific heat at a constant pressure was made at the nozzle throat. Qualitative agreement was achieved upstream and downstream of the nozzle throat due to effects that are absent in this study. These backed-out data were devised to match nozzle erosion that resulted from the combination of heat transfer (convective, radiative, and conductive), chemical (transpiration), and mechanical (shear and particle impingement forces) effects. To the author's knowledge, these effects have not been investigated/reported simultaneously.

ID DESIGN
AB Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tanks represent an important percentage of net weight and cost of any reusable launch vehicle (RLV). Moreover they play structural and thermal and propulsive roles at the same time. The transition from metal to composite material is then considered an obliged choice. In this study, a FEM optimisation procedure has been developed in order to both increase payload (by decreasing tank mass) and improve aerodynamic and controllability (by increasing global flexural stiffness). The optimisation of these two contradictory objectives have been obtained using a standard FE numerical tool within an innovative optimisation procedure, as a possible alternative to genetic algorithm approaches [Jaunky N, Knight NF, Ambur DR. Optimal design of general stiffened composite circular cylinders for global buckling with strength constraints. Compos Struct 1998;41:243-52. [1]]. The key features of this procedure are: the starting point determination methodology; a sensitivity analysis based on an integration between the classical laminate theory and the netting theory to validate the FE optimiser results; the strategy of choice of the best compromise solution in terms of design constraints and objective function.

AB Arc jet test results are summarized of the Mars Exploration Rover silicone-impregnated reusable ceramic ablator (SIRCA) transverse impulse rocket system (TIRS) cover test series in the Panel Test facility at NASA Ames Research Center. The primary objective of this arc jet test series was to evaluate design details of the SIRCA TIRS cover interface to the aeroshell under simulated atmospheric entry heating conditions. Four test articles were tested in an arc jet environment with three different seal configurations. The test condition was designed to match the predicted peak flight heat load at the gap region between the SIRCA and the backshell and resulted in an overtest for the apex region of the SIRCA TIRS cover. Repeatable thermocouple data were obtained and compared with SIRCA thermal response analyses. The one-dimensional thermal response prediction compared well with the thermocouple data for the location at the backshell interface. For the apex region of the SIRCA TIRS cover, a one-dimensional thermal response analysis resulted in an overprediction because there were strong multidimensional conduction effects due to the TIRS cover geometry. In general, the test results provide strong experimental evidence that supports the adequacy of the baseline seal design.

AB The Future Launchers Preparatory he Programme (FLPP) was approved by the last ESA Ministerial Council and began in February 2004, ending a long period without a programme dedicated to future launchers at the European level. The aim is to prepare the Next Generation Launcher to be operational around 2020. System studies and technology activities therefore need to be conducted, including ground and in-flight tests, to foster new technologies capable of providing high performance and reliability, together with low life-cycle costs. The final choke between an expendable or reusable type of launch vehicle will be made on the basis of proven technological readiness and consolidated cost and risk assessments.

AB Based on requirements for a next-generation rocket test facility, elements of a prototype intelligent rocket test facility (IRTF) have been implemented. The preliminary results provide the basis for future advanced development and validation using rocket test stand facilities at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Key components include distributed smart sensor elements integrated using a knowledge-driven environment. One of the specific goals is to imbue sensors with the intelligence needed to perform self-diagnosis of health and to participate in a hierarchy of health determination at sensor, process, and system levels. We have identified issues important to further development of health-enabled networks, which should be of interest to others working with smart sensors and intelligent health management systems.

AB A cryogenic tank made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) shell with aluminum thin liner has been designed as a liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank for an ISAS reusable launch vehicle, and the function of it has been proven by repeated flights onboard the test vehicle called reusable vehicle testing (RVT) in October 2003. The liquid hydrogen tank has to be a pressure vessel, because the fuel of the engine of the test vehicle is supplied by fuel pressure. The pressure vessel of a combination of the outer shell of CFRP for strength element at a cryogenic temperature and the inner liner of aluminum for gas barrier has shown excellent weight merit for this purpose. Interfaces such as tank outline shape, bulk capacity, maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP), thermal insulation, pipe arrangement, and measurement of data are also designed to be ready onboard. This research has many aims, not only development of reusable cryogenic composite tank but also the demonstration of repeated operation including thermal cycle and stress cycle, familiarization with test techniques of operation of cryogenic composite tanks, and the accumulation of data for future design of tanks, vehicle structures, safety evaluation, and total operation systems.

ID RELIABILITY; OPTIMIZATION
AB A probabilistic optimization methodology for aerospace vehicle design is developed that takes into account coupling between system-level and component-level design requirements. The proposed methodology represents the system-component design as a reliability-based multidisciplinary optimization, problem. The system design optimizes the geometry of a reusable launch vehicle for minimum weight while satisfying aerodynamic constraints. The component design relates to the structural sizing of vehicle components, in this case a liquid-hydrogen tank. The optimization formulation includes probabilistic constraints, which are evaluated using the limit state-based reliability analysis methodology. The system and component designs are linked through stochastic state variables relating to vehicle geometry and component weight, and the optimization at both levels is pursued. Finally, the reliability-based multidisciplinary optimization is solved using an efficient decoupled approach.

AB Numerous studies have already identified that Fully Reusable Launch Vehicle Two-Stage-To-Orbit concepts (FRLV TSTO) could be one of the best solutions for meeting economical and technical objectives of second-generation RLV.
   In 2001, CNES initiated and funded system studies aimed at defining the most promising FRLV TSTO configurations in terms of technical and technological challenges and economical effectiveness. EADS-LV leads for this purpose an industrial team composed of EADS-LV, SNECMA Moteurs, DASSAULT Aviation and ONERA.
   The presented programme is a two-phase study addressing three coupled issues: viable configuration definition, key issues analysis and vehicle architecture design.
   The first phase has been split into three periods: (1) establishing preliminary but consolidated assumptions and ground rules, (2) systematic computation of the two stages main features for a given payload mass into LEO orbit, (3) preliminary definition of remarkable configurations and associated propulsion systems.
   The second phase, under development, is mainly focused on the design of a study configuration by figuring out key issues and providing consolidated data (technical and economical performance).
   This paper intends to present the major investigations of the first phase:
   a survey of the overall approach;
   the main technical characteristics;
   the major recommendations for further steps. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On-board entry trajectory planning for sub-orbital flight
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
ID GUIDANCE
AB An algorithm for on-board planning of sub-orbital entry trajectories is presented. For entry vehicles with low lift-to-drag ratios and entering entry flight at sub-orbital speeds, this algorithm fills a gap left in a recently developed methodology for on-board generation of three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) entry trajectories. The algorithm developed in this paper is able to reliably generate a 3DOF feasible sub-orbital entry trajectory in a time frame compatible with on-board environment. The combination of this algorithm and an algorithm recently developed for orbital entry missions provides the capability for full-envelope autonomous adaptive entry guidance. The current algorithm is validated by extensive high fidelity simulations using a sub-orbital reusable launch vehicle model and difficult mission scenarios including failures and aborts.

AB Reusable launch vehicles (RLV) currently envisioned incorporate a Aide variety of propulsion types. Various propulsion devices have been designed, or are being designed. The Integral-Rocket-Ranijet (IRR) propulsion mainly applies to a tactical missile boost system and few have mentioned this system in RLV design. According to the technological ability of Taiwan and a feasibility study, it shows that the present reusable launch system can exploit the potential benefit of H?,R propulsion for the RLV system. A conceptual study of an unmanned two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle is designed in this paper. The first stage of the vehicle is reusable with IRR engines. The second stage is expendable and rocket powered. The assumed mission is designed to insert a 100kg payload into a low earth circular orbit at various inclination angles. The calculations are made for the case where the TSTO system is used in Taiwan. The fundamentals of launch vehicle design are examined using simplified two-stage performance equations. Launch vehicle design is optimized when the performance and progammatic drivers are balanced. There is an acceptable set of launch and landing sites on islands off the coast of Taiwan.

AB It is believed that a potential means for further significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results also in a stimulation of launch rates of small satellites, is to make the launcher reusable. to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Therefore, not only launching small satellites with expendable rocket on non-regular flights but also with reusable rockets on regular flights should be considered for the long term. However. developing. producing and operating reusable rockets require a fundamental change in the current "business as usual" philosophy. Under current conditions, it might not be possible to develop, to produce or to operate a reusable vehicle fleet economically. The favorite philosophy is based on "smart business" processes adapted by the author using cost engineering techniques. In the following paper, major strategies for reducing costs are discussed. which are applied for a representative program proposal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work explores neural networks (NN) based control approach to nonlinear flight systems in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. Neuro-adaptive control incorporating with two neural network (NN) units is proposed to cope with NN reconstruction error and other lumped system uncertainties. It is shown that with the proposed strategy, the angles of attack, sideslip and body-axis roll of the vehicle are effectively controlled. The method does not involve analytical estimation of the upper bounds on ideal weights, reconstruction error, or nonlinear functions. Stable on-line weight-tuning algorithms are derived based on Lyapunov's stability theory. Analyses and simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

TI Ceramic matrix composites: A challenge in space-propulsion technology

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Various technology programs in Europe are concerned, besides developing reliable and rugged, low-cost, throwaway equipment, with preparing for future reusable propulsion technologies. One of the key roles for realizing reusable engine components is the use of modern and innovative materials. One of the key technologies that concerns various engine manufacturers worldwide is the development of fiber-reinforced ceramics-CMCs (ceramic matrix composites). The advantages for the developers are obvious-the low specific weight, the high specific strength over a large temperature range, and their great damage tolerance compared with monolithic ceramics make this material class extremely interesting as a construction material. Over the past few years, the EADS-ST Company (formerly DASA) has, together with various partners, worked intensively on developing components for hypersonic engines and liquid rocket propulsion systems. In the year 2000, various hot-firing tests with subscale (scale 1:5) and full-scale nozzle extensions were conducted. In this year, a further decisive milestone was achieved in the sector of small thrusters, and long-term tests served to demonstrate the extraordinary stability of the C/SiC material. Besides developing and testing radiation-cooled nozzle components and small-thruster combustion chambers, EADS-ST worked on the preliminary development of actively cooled structures for future reusable propulsion systems. In order to get one step nearer to this objective, the development of a new fiber composite was commenced within the framework of a regionally sponsored program. The objective here is to create multidirectional (3D) textile structures combined with a cost-effective infiltration process. Besides material and process development, the project also encompasses the development of special metal/ceramic and ceramic/ceramic joining techniques as well as studying and verifying nondestructive investigation processes for the purpose of testing components.

AB This article focuses on the thermal protection system (TPS) and hot structures based on carbon fiber-reinforced Sic (C/Sic) material, which protects the high thermal-loaded areas and control surfaces of a reusable launch vehicle (RLV). The goal of the test program is the evaluation of the lifetime of different types of TPS under reusability aspects for RLV application, reflecting the re-entry environments together with the effect of impacts from low-speed impact, rain erosion, and hail core impact. The test results of the C/SiC samples with the self-healing oxidation protection system showed very promising results concerning reusability and lifetime.

AB The reusable launch vehicle thrust cell liner, or thrust chamber, is a critical component of the space shuttle main engine. It is designed to operate in some of the most severe conditions seen in engineering practice. These conditions give rise to characteristic deformations of the cooling channel wall exposed to high thermal gradients and a coolant-induced pressure differential, characterized by the wall's bulging and thinning, which ultimately lead to experimentally observed "dog-house" failure modes. In this paper, these deformations are modeled using the cylindrical version of the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials in conjunction with two inelastic constitutive models for the liner's constituents, namely Robinson's unified viscoplasticity theory and the power-law creep model. Comparison of the results based on these two constitutive models under cyclic thermomechanical loading demonstrates that, for the employed constitutive model parameters, the power-law creep model predicts more precisely the experimentally observed deformation leading to the "dog-house" failure mode for multiple short cycles, while also providing much improved computational efficiency. The differences in the two models' predictions are rooted in the differences in the short-term creep and relaxation responses.

TI Optimal design of two-stage-to-orbit space planes with airbreathing

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
AB Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. Our aim in this study is to apply an optimization method for conceptual designs of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) space planes with airbreathing engines on the first-stage boosters and to obtain necessary vehicle sizes and their optimal flight trajectories. First, we integrate analysis methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yield the minimized total dry mass of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO space plane. The optimal solutions show that TSTO space planes with boosters powered by rocket engines added to the airbreathing engines are lighter in total dry mass than vehicles with boosters propelled by only airbreathing engines. However, it is necessary to lighten and miniaturize vehicle components to achieve greater feasibility. In addition, the trajectory optimizations enable the booster to glide back to a launch site using little propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory. This study confirms that the analysis and optimization method proposed are effective.

AB In view of the use of 2195 Al-Li alloy in the construction of super-light-weight external fuel tank of space shuttles, bulkheads of reusable single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicles and in combat ground vehicles, the dependence of tensile properties, fracture toughness and fatigue resistance of this alloy on the specimen orientation and welding is very important and was studied. The T8 base alloy, with primary strengthening precipitates of T-1 (Al2CuLi) phase, contained mainly brass-type texture. After welding with AA 4043 filler alloy, the fusion zone (FZ) consisted of T-1 (AlLiSi) phase and in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) T-1 phase was replaced by T-B (Al7Cu4Li) phase, and micro-cracks were observed. The post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) resulted in the spheroidization of primary T phase and the precipitation of more T particles in the FZ, and the dissolution of T-B phase and the re-precipitation of T-1 phase in the HAZ. The yield strength, fracture toughness and fatigue threshold of the 2195-T8 alloy was observed to depend on the specimen orientation, with the lowest values obtained at 45degrees to the rolling direction. Welding resulted in a reduction in the tensile properties and fatigue strength. The post-weld heat treatment enhanced the yield strength, but no increase in fatigue strength was observed. Fracture mechanisms in various cases were evaluated by SEM examination of fracture surfaces and are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS

ID AUTOPILOT DESIGN
AB Current flight control of reusable launch vehicles is based on table look-up gains for specific flight conditions. A new suboptimal nonlinear control technique for the complete ascent phase of reusable launch vehicles is presented. The new technique, called the theta-D method, is synthesized by adding perturbations to a typical optimal control formulation with a quadratic cost function. The controller expressions are obtained by getting an approximate closed-form solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Beliman equation. The theta-D method avoids iterative online solutions. A controller using this new method has been designed for the ascent phase of a reusable launch vehicle and implemented in a six-degrees-of-freedom high-fidelity simulator being run at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Simulation results show that the theta-D controller achieves accurate tracking for the ascent phase of the reusable launch vehicle while being robust to external disturbances and plant uncertainties.

AB There are a number of approaches to advanced guidance and control that have the potential for achieving the goals of significantly increasing reusable launch vehicle (or any space vehicle that enters an atmosphere) safety and reliability and reducing the cost. This paper examines some approaches to entry guidance. An effort called Integration and Testing of Advanced Guidance and Control Technologies has recently completed a rigorous testing phase, where these algorithms faced high-fidelity vehicle models and were required to perform a variety of representative tests. The algorithm developers spent substantial effort improving the algorithm performance in the testing. This paper lists the test cases used to demonstrate that the desired results are achieved, shows an automated test scoring method that greatly reduces the evaluation effort required, and displays results of the tests. The primary contribution of the paper is to provide a quantitative comparison between the performance of five different entry guidance approaches. Results show a significant improvement over the current state of the art (shuttle-like guidance). The two best-scoring algorithm approaches show roughly equivalent results. Both can be expected to work well for future vehicle concepts.

TI Unpowered approach and landing guidance using trajectory planning
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A guidance scheme that employs a trajectory-planning algorithm has been developed for the approach and landing phase of an unpowered reusable launch vehicle. The trajectory-planning scheme computes a reference flight profile by piecing together several flight segments that are defined by a small set of geometric parameters. A feasible reference profile that brings the vehicle from its current state to a desired landing condition is obtained by iteration on a single geometric parameter, and the flight-path angle at the start of the flare is selected as the iteration variable. Open- and closed-loop guidance commands are readily available once the reference trajectory is obtained. The trajectory-planning algorithm is able to generate new reference profiles quickly for test cases with large variations in winds, vehicle energy, and vehicle drag. The effectiveness of the trajectory-planning algorithm is demonstrated by several numerical simulations that show that the guided vehicle is able to land successfully with an adequate energy margin.

AB Kerosene and methane are two promising candidate propellants for a future reusable booster stage. This study assesses the merits of both propellants and compares their respective performance when used in a booster stage. First of all, the principal properties of both propellants are identified. An analysis of a comparable full-flow staged combustion cycle engine for each propellant follows. The final assessment is made based on the results of a performance analysis of a launch vehicle making use of these motors in reusable fly-back boosters. The use of kerosene as propellant leads to a lower booster dry mass, making it the preferred choice if no operational benefits of methane can be identified.

TI Optimal conceptual design of two-stage reusable rocket vehicles

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

ID GENERATION; LAUNCHERS
AB Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. This paper applies an optimization method for conceptual designs of winged fully reusable rocket two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicles in both horizontal takeoff and vertical launch styles. We first describe our methods for analyzing vehicle design. Then we integrate those methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yields the minimized parameter, defined as the total gross weight of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO vehicle. The optimal solutions show the necessity of lightening and miniaturizing components. Vertical launch vehicles are lighter in total gross weight than horizontal takeoff vehicles. In addition to optimizing vehicle configuration, this study also optimizes ascent and return trajectories. These optimizations enable the booster to glide back to the launch site without propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory.

AB This paper addresses the application of an autonomous guidance concept to the ascent flight of the reusable launch vehicle Hopper, and to the reentry mission of the space plane X-38. Presently, the guidance requirements with respect to autonomy, accuracy and mission flexibility have been increased steadily for RLV applications. Nonlinear Programming (NLP)-based guidance strategies have been proposed that offer the potential to meet these demands. The autonomous guidance is achieved by combining onboard flight path prediction and NLP methods for flight optimization. Such guidance strategies hold promise for reduced pre-mission analyses for trajectory planning, and for improved adaptability to non-nominal mission conditions. Its applicability, autonomy and performance will be discussed showing numerical results obtained with a flight-simulation environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of any future reusable launch vehicle (RLV) shall aim at a significant reduction of the payload transportation costs. One of the most expensive systems for any RLV is the thermal protection system (TPS), which protects the vehicle from the high thermal loads during re-entry. EADS ST is developing and qualifying TPS components and technologies for a wide range of applications and temperatures. As a part of the German National technology research programme ASTRA, these technologies were used for a TPS pre-design of the suborbital Hopper (Fig. 1) as a reference RLV system.
   On the basis of aerothermal re-entry loads determined by computational fluid dynamics methods, temperatures and heat loads during re-entry were determined for the entire vehicle. According to those findings, one or more possible TPS concepts were then pre-selected for the various vehicle areas according to the maximum temperatures. After the final selection (using trade-offs when necessary), a conservative estimate for expected TPS mass was established. (C) 2003 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A semi-expendable launch vehicle (LV), i.e. an expendable LV using a reusable first stage might be a possibility to start the "virtuous circle" for future reusable launch vehicle, technologies, reuse operations and in the end also new market segments evolution. Commercial competitiveness must not be requested, but robust operation and the use of existing building blocks. This Y-Vehicle would be a small or may be a medium size launch vehicle typically used for institutional payloads. A variety of trade-offs have to be performed for system concept selection. In addition new ideas for development, AIT and operation have to be included. Little effort is yet invested in this idea, but it is part of the EADS ST ambitions for the European future launchers preparation system lead on industrial side and the necessary link with the available knowledge established within the successful Ariane programme.

AB This paper presents a fundamental study of the aeroelastic behavior of hypersonic vehicles. Two separate configurations are examined. First, a typical cross-section analysis of a double-wedge airfoil in hypersonic flow is performed using three different types of unsteady airloads: piston theory and complete Euler and Navier Stokes solutions based on computational fluid dynamics. The analysis of the double-wedge airfoil is used to justify the usage of the simple aerodynamics for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV). Subsequently, the aeroelastic problem for a complete vehicle that resembles an RLV in trimmed flight is considered, using approximate first-order piston theory aerodynamics. The results provided for these configurations provide guidelines for approximate aeroelastic modelling of hypersonic vehicles. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ADHESIVE JOINTS; STRENGTH
AB To obtain a better understanding of the response of the structural adhesives used in the space shuttle's reusable solid rocket motor (RSRM) nozzle, an extensive effort has been conducted to characterize in detail the failure properties of these adhesives. This effort involved the development of a failure model that includes the effects of multi-axial loading, temperature, and time. An understanding of the effects of these parameters on adhesive failure is crucial to the prediction of safety of the RSRM nozzle. The use of this newly developed multi-axial, temperature, and time-dependent failure model for modeling failure for the adhesives TIGA 321, EA913NA, and EA946 is documented. The development of the mathematical failure model using constant load rate data for both normal and shear loading is presented. Verification of the accuracy of the failure model is shown through comparisons between predictions and measured creep and multi-axial failure data. The verification indicates that the failure model performs well for a wide range of conditions (loading, temperature, and time) for the three adhesives. The failure criterion is shown to be accurate through the glass transition for the EA946 adhesive. Though this failure model has been developed and evaluated with adhesives, the concepts should be applicable for other isotropic materials.

DE spaceplane design; SKYLON; CFRP space frame; fuselage structure
AB A reusable SSTO spaceplane employing dual mode airbreathing/rocket engines, such as SKYLON, has a voluminous fuselage in order to accommodate the considerable quantities of hydrogen fuel needed for the ascent. The loading intensity which this fuselage has to withstand is relatively low due to the modest in-flight inertial accelerations coupled with the very low density of liquid hydrogen. Also the requirement to accommodate considerable temperature differentials between the internal cryogenic tankage and the aerodynamically heated outer skin of the vehicle imposes an additional design constraint that results in an optimum fuselage structural concept very different to conventional aircraft or rocket practice. Several different structural concepts exist for the primary loadbearing structure. This paper explores the design possibilities of the various types and explains why an independent near ambient temperature CFRP truss structure was selected for the SKYLON vehicle. The construction of such a truss structure, at a scale not witnessed since the days of the airship, poses a number of manufacturing and design difficulties. In particular the construction of the nodes and their attachment to the struts is considered to be a key issue. This paper describes the current design status of the overall truss geometry, strut construction and manufacturing route, and the final method of assembly. The results of a preliminary strut and node test programme are presented which give confidence that the design targets will eventually be met.

AB The second-generation reusable launch vehicle will incorporate sophisticated new guidance and control methods to increase the system's flexibility, in particular making it a practical vehicle for unmanned cargo missions. This project focuses on trajectory design and guidance for the terminal area energy management phase of flight, where traditional methods have produced limited results. Fuzzy logic methods are used to make onboard autonomous gliding return trajectory design robust to the possibility of control surface failures, thus, increasing the flexibility of unmanned gliding recovery and landing. Fuzzy inference systems are used to design the trajectory and provide guidance commands for the vehicle bank angle and negative z axis acceleration. Fuzzy logic provides a practical means of incorporating conflicting objectives and constraints in choosing trajectory parameters. The method has the flexibility to choose these parameters from a continuum of possible values. The design is validated using a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom simulation of the X-33 technology demonstrator.

DT Article
AB This paper presents a study of a fully reusable earth-to-orbit launch vehicle concept with horizontal take-off and landing, employing a turbojet engine for low speed, and a rocket for high-speed acceleration and space operations. This concept uses existing technology to the maximum possible extent, thereby reducing development time, cost and effort. It uses the experience in aerial filling of military aircrafts for propellant filling at an altitude of 13 km at a flight speed of M = 0.85. Aerial filling of propellant reduces the take-off weight significantly thereby minimizing the structural weight of the vehicles The vehicle takes off horizontally and uses turbojet engines till the end of the propellant filling operation. The rocket engines provide thrust for the next phase till the injection of a satellite at LEO. A sensitivity analysis of the mission with respect to rocket engine specific impulse and overall vehicle structural factor is also presented in this paper. A conceptual design of space plane with a payload capability of 10 ton to LEO is carried out. The study shows that the realization of an aerial propellant transfer space plane is possible with limited development of new technology thus reducing the demands on the finances required for achieving the objectives.

TI Autonomous safety and reliability features of the K-1 avionics system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Kistler Aerospace Corporation is developing the K-1, a fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Both stages return to the launch site using parachutes and airbags. Initial flight operations will occur from Woomera, Australia. K-I guidance is performed autonomously. Each stage of the K-I employs a triplex, fault tolerant avionics architecture, including three fault tolerant computers and three radiation hardened Embedded GPS/INS units with a hardware voter. The K-1 has an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system on each stage residing in the three vehicle computers based on similar systems in commercial aircraft. During first-stage ascent, the IVHM system performs an Instantaneous Impact Prediction (IIP) calculation 25 times per second, initiating an abort in the event the vehicle is outside a predetermined safety corridor for at least 3 consecutive calculations. In this event, commands are issued to terminate thrust, separate the stages, dump all propellant in the first-stage, and initiate a normal landing sequence. The second-stage flight computer calculates its ability to reach orbit along its state vector, initiating an abort sequence similar to the first stage if it cannot. On a nominal mission, following separation, the second-stage also performs calculations to assure its impact point is within a safety corridor.
   The K-1's guidance and control design is being tested through simulation with hardware-in-the-loop at Draper Laboratory. Kistler's verification strategy assures reliable and safe operation of the K-1. (C) 2003 Kistler Aerospace Corporation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Metallic thermal protection system requirements, environments, and

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Achieving the ultimate goal of an economically viable reusable launch vehicle will eventually require developing Federal Aviation Regulation-type performance-based requirements and certification by the Federal Aviation Administration, as is currently done for commercial transports. Because the necessary requirements do not currently exist, there is no verifiable and traceable link between thermal protection system design implementation and resulting performance, safety, and cost. An initial attempt has been made to outline a set of performance-based thermal protection system design requirements. Critical requirements that will have a profound effect on the economic viability of a reusable launch vehicle, such as those for ground hail strike, lightning strike, bird strike, rain/rain erosion, and on-orbit debris/micrometeoroid hypervelocity impact have been proposed. In addition to design requirements, the importance of both compiling a comprehensive loads envelope and deriving time- and location-consistent loads for thermal protection system design and sizing is addressed. Including ascent abort trajectories as limit-load cases and on-orbit debris/micrometeoroid hypervelocity impact as one of the discrete-source-damage cases is imperative because of their significant impact on thermal protection system design and resulting performance, reliability, and operability. General features of a suite of integrated airframe concepts is summarized, and the specific details of a metallic thermal protection system concept having design flexibility that enables weight and operability to be traded and balanced is described.

DT Article
AB A process is developed to perform thermal and structural analysis and sizing and to perform sensitivity studies on the latest metallic thermal protection system developed at NASA Langley Research Center. The process defined can be used to determine appropriate materials and approximate thicknesses and is the basis for initial thermal protection system weight estimates. Metallic thermal protection systems are a key technology for reducing the cost of reusable launch vehicles, offering the combination of increased durability and competitive weights when compared to other systems. Accurate sizing of metallic thermal protection systems requires combined thermal and structural analysis. Initial sensitivity studies were conducted using transient one-dimensional finite element thermal analysis to determine the influence of various design and analysis parameters on thermal protection system weight. The thermal analysis model was then used in combination with static deflection and failure mode analysis of the thermal protection system sandwich panel outer surface to obtain minimum weight configurations at three vehicle stations on the windward centerline of a representative reusable launch vehicle. The coupled nature of the analysis requires an iterative analysis process, which is described. Findings from the sensitivity analysis are reported, along with preliminary designs at the three vehicle stations considered.

AB A new metallic thermal-protection-system concept has been designed, analyzed, and fabricated. A specific location on a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle was selected to develop loads and requirements needed to design prototype panels. The design loads include ascent and entry heating rates, pressures, acoustics, and accelerations. Additional design issues were identified and discussed. An iterative sizing procedure was used to size the thermal protection system panels for thermal and structural loads as part of an integrated wall construction that included the thermal protection system and cryogenic tank structure. The panels were sized to maintain acceptable temperatures on the underlying structure and to operate under the design structural loading. Detailed creep. analyses were also performed on critical components of the panels. Four 18-in.-square metallic thermal-protection-system panels were fabricated. A lightweight, thermally compliant support system to connect the thermal protection system to the cryogenic tank structure was designed and fabricated.

AB Panel flutter of a metallic thermal protection system (TPS) for a reusable launch vehicle is investigated. The study covers both panel flutter analysis tool development as well as an analysis of a specific metallic TPS configuration for the X-33 experimental vehicle. An analytical tool was developed to predict panel flutter at hypersonic How conditions and at arbitrary flow angles to a structural panel, The nonlinear, hypersonic aerodynamic terms were found to have an insignificant effect on the panel flutter predictions for the X-33 TPS. The honeycomb sandwich that comprises most of the outer surface of the X-33 TPS panel was found to have large margins of safety for panel flutter for all flight conditions. However, the outer overlapping, panel-to-panel seals were predicted to be. susceptible to panel flutter when nearly parallel to the flow.

AB Performance figures are presented for reusable, winged rocket stages launched from several large transport aircraft, including the Boeing 747, the Russian Anotonov An-226, a large supersonic aircraft comparable to the XB-70 aircraft, which achieved Mach 3.1 flight with conventional turbojet propulsion in 1964, and a Mach 6 conceptual aircraft based on the MA145-XAB ramjet demonstrated in 1968. Advantages of air launch include a reduced ascent-to-orbit delta-velocity, reduced drag, the capability to launch at any latitude, and simplified abort modes. Launch from the XB-70 flight condition would allow a 22% reduction in delta-velocity required of the rocket and a significant reduction in drag incurred by rocket flight beginning at an atmospheric density 1/20th that of sea level. Launch from a Mach 6, 85,000-ft altitude condition would allow a 33% reduction in delta-velocity; a reusable rocket of 262,000 lb launched at this condition could deliver a 23,500-lb payload to orbit utilizing a 523-s vacuum specific impulse advanced rocket engine. Fluorine/lithium-hydrogen engines achieved 523 s in U.S. Air Force and NASA development programs of the 1960s and 1970s. Comparisons to ground-launched, all-rocket vehicles delivering equivalent payloads to orbit are presented. Fluorine propellant reactivity and engine development history are also discussed.

AB The preliminary design phase of any program is the key to its eventual successful development. The more advanced a design, the more this tends to be true. For this reason, the preliminary design phase is particularly important in the design of aerospace systems. Errors in preliminary design tend to be fundamental and tend to cause programs to be abandoned, or to be changed fundamentally, and at great cost later in the design development. In order to facilitate the identification of attractive design regimes, the NASA Ames Research Center initiated a project, supporting the 2(nd) Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Program, to develop an advanced suite of conceptual design tools. The tool, called Risk Oriented Program Optimization Tool (ROPOT) was developed for evaluation of Reusable Space Transportation System (RSTS) conceptual analysis. The ROPOT tool is a modular "lego-block" approach that is built on risk drivers from the Space Shuttle.
   This paper illustrates how this tool was adapted and applied to the decision-making about future space transportation system architectures, including new Orbital Space Plane designs that are to be launched on the new Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles. ROPOT has been further developed to provide the capability to explore crew survival capabilities of the vehicles throughout the mission, and develop insights and concerning the key trades involving performance, cost, crew safety and developmental risk.
   The tool demonstrated the ability to capture the key trades necessary to make informed decisions concerning alternative vehicle concepts, clearly identify strengths and weaknesses of design alternatives, and identify the most fruitful areas for achieving overall benefits. The results of this effort demonstrate the ability of ROPOT to be easily adapted to evaluate a broad range of vehicle types ranging from fully-reusable advanced concepts of the 2(nd) Generation program, to near term expendable vehicles.

AB Based on high level safety and cost requirements, system architects and subsystem engineers are called upon to provide requirements at a lower level during the conceptual design phase of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). This paper describes an event tree based methodology for quantitatively assessing the limits of some of the lower-level Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) requirements during RLV conceptual design. The metrics assessed in the paper are fault detection coverage, false alarm probability, fault isolation capability, probability of IVHM failing to detect a fault, and safety allocation. The fault detection and isolation metrics were assessed based on their applicability with respect to cost and safety in the mission and turnaround phase of the RLV operations. The paper shows that the mission-phase requirement for IVHM fault detection coverage for a subsystem is large (more stringent) when IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, the failure remediation probability is small, and the subsystem is already reliable. The requirement on IVHM false alarm rate in the mission phase is small (more stringent) when the subsystem is reliable, IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, and IVHM should cause fewer false aborts.
   The paper concludes by stressing the use of appropriate system analysis and optimization in allocating IVHM requirements to a subsystem of the RLV. Although the paper is written from an IVHM and RLV perspective, it is targeted towards system engineers/architects who are interested in estimating the effects of fault detection and isolation requirements during conceptual design.

AB A Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) should be sized to minimise the specific launch costs and this probably means a payload around 10 tonnes and the 4.5 m diameter envelope, both similar to the Space Shuttle capability. This sizing means large payloads, in particular orbital infrastructure systems, if launched on the RLV would have to be carried in many pieces and assembled in orbit. It has been argued that while this approach leads to the lowest launch cost the savings are lost in the extra costs imposed on other factors in the overall acquisition cost. Using a Heavy Lift Vehicle (HLV) with high specific launch costs but able to launch the system in one piece would lead to lower overall acquisition costs. The paper explores the requirements for an HLV designed to support an RLV and proposes a payload of around 40 tonnes and a diameter of 7 meters. It explores three candidate systems Ariane 5 with enlarge payload fairing, an HLV variant of the Space Shuttle and a new reusable system. The most cost effective is the new system but its economic risk and acquisition cost is clearly not sustainable in parallel with an RLV development. However both Ariane 5 and a Shuttle based system could be used as transition launchers for the early stages of RLV operations, with a new HLV system development following when its market is established.

AB In the application of adaptive flight control, significant issues arise due to limitations in the plant inputs, such as actuator displacement limits, actuator rate limits, linear input dynamics, and time delay. A method is introduced that allows an adaptive law to be designed for the system without these input characteristics and then to be applied to the system with these characteristics, without affecting adaptation. This includes allowing correct adaptation while the plant input is saturated and allows the adaptation law to function when not actually in control of the plant. To apply the method, estimates of actuator positions must be found. However, the adaptation law can correct for errors in these estimates. Proof of boundedness of system signals is provided for a single hidden-layer perceptron neural network adaptive law. Simulation results utilizing the methods introduced for neural network adaptive control of a reusable launch vehicle are presented for nominal flight and under failure cases that require considerable adaptation.

AB Linear plug nozzles have been receiving more attention since the development of the single stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle. It is well known that supersonic external flows cause a degradation of the plug nozzle performance. To minimize this degradation, different kinds of afterbody shapes can be chosen. Instead of boattail shapes, the present study concerns the use of (ventilated) trailing-edge cavities. Various models of the afterbody have been used to investigate numerically performance with an external flow at a Mach number of M(infinity) = 2. Navier-Stokes equations provided with a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model and a Degani-Schiff correction were used for these calculations. For all of these models, the effects of increasing or decreasing pressure ratio have been taken into account, as well as the use of different truncations of the plug nozzle.

AB NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) calls for investments in Space Shuttle safety upgrades, second generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) advanced development and third generation RLV and in-space research and technology. NASA's third generation launch systems are to be fully reusable and operational by 2025. The goals for third generation launch systems are to reduce cost by a factor of 100 and improve safety by a factor of 10,000 over current systems. The Advanced Space Transportation Program Office (ASTP) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL has the agency lead to develop third generation space transportation technologies. The Hypersonics Investment Area, part of ASTP, is developing the third generation launch vehicle technologies in two main areas, propulsion and airframes. The program's major investment is in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion since it offers the greatest potential for meeting the third generation launch vehicles. The program will mature the technologies in three key propulsion areas, scramjets, rocket-based combined cycle and turbine-based combination cycle. Ground and flight propulsion tests are being planned for the propulsion technologies. Airframe technologies will be matured primarily through ground testing.
   This paper describes NASA's activities in hypersonics. Current programs, accomplishments, future plans and technologies that are being pursued by the Hypersonics Investment Area under the Advanced Space Transportation Program Office will be discussed.

AB The paper presents the analysis of space transportation cost development for the geosynchronous orbit (GEO). While the launch cost increased subtancially since 1963 - the launch year of the first GEO satellite - the satellite mass increased from 36 kg to more than 2800 kg in GEO (BoM). Thus the specific cost (launch cost per kg or per channel) have dramatically been reduced from 550 000 $/kg to only 36 000 $/kg in 2002. The reason, however, is almost only the Jaw of scale", i.e. the increased payload mass, but not improvement of the launch systems. An further cost reduction on the launch vehicle side is possible by the introduction of reusable launch systems (RLVs) by a factor 2 to 4, depending on the vehicle design concept.

DT Article
AB This paper presents a business planning model for a commercial space launch system. The financing model is based on market analyses and projections combined with market capture models. An operations model is used to derive the annual cash income. Parametric cost modeling, development and production schedules are used for quantifying the annual expenditures, the internal rate of return, break even point of positive cash flow and the respective prices per launch. Alternative consortia structures, cash flow methods, capture rates and launch prices are used to examine the sensitivity of the model. Then the model is applied for a promising semi-reusable launcher concept, showing the general achievability of the commercial approach and the necessary pre-conditions.

TI Implications of previous space commercialization experiences for the
   reusable launch vehicle
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The United States' 1994 National Space Transportation Policy directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to work with industry on the development of technologies required for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV). In the partnership that has evolved from that directive, NASA envisions its role as providing support for technological risk reduction and for developing space, transportation to serve government needs. NASA officials assume that the development of an operational, commercial RLV will be carried out by the private sector without use of government funds. Under that scenario, the Federal government will simply become a customer for commercial RLV services.
   In evaluating the prospects for the development of a commercially viable RLV, it may be useful to examine "lessons learned" from previous space commercialization efforts-both those that succeeded and those that did not. It can be argued that several distinct streams of market and technological development may have to converge for successful commercialization of space systems to occur. Potential factors influencing the prospects for commercialization include the size and growth rate of the potential customer base, the extent to which a governmental customer exists to underpin the market, the development of associated "value-added" markets, the stability of governmental policies, the levels of technological and business risk, and the degree to which competitive markets exist. This paper examines two previous space commercialization experiences, evaluates the relative importance of the various factors that influence the prospects for-success of commercialization efforts, and assesses the implications of those factors for the commercial viability of the proposed RLV.

AB Two important objectives for the development of a second-generation reusable launch vehicle are concerned with significantly reducing cost and risk. Meeting these objectives requires a progressive design approach that eliminates noncompetitive designs as early in the process as possible. During these early stages, designs are usually, evaluated at a low-fidelity conceptual level. Nevertheless, design decisions need to be made that significantly affect both cost and risk. Thus, it is crucial that both of these factors are considered during conceptual design. Methods to facilitate system risk assessment and risk vs cost allocation during the conceptual design of an aerospace system are presented. The analysis and optimization take into account the uncertainties in design variables that have important effects on safety, performance, and cost. The proposed methodology is illustrated. for the geometry design of a reuseable launch vehicle.

AB This paper discusses the relevant selection criteria for a single stage to orbit (SSTO) propulsion system and then reviews the characteristics of the typical engine types proposed for this role against these criteria. The engine types considered include Hydrogen/Oxygen (H-2/O-2) rockets, Scramjets, Turbojets, Turborockets and Liquid Air Cycle Engines. In the authors opinion none of the above engines are able to meet all the necessary criteria for an SSTO propulsion system simultaneously. However by selecting appropriate features from each it is possible to synthesise a new class of engines which are specifically optimised for the SSTO role. The resulting engines employ precooling of the airstream and a high internal pressure ratio to enable a relatively conventional high pressure rocket combustion chamber to be utilised in both airbreathing and rocket modes. This results in a significant mass saving with installation advantages which by careful design of the cycle thermodynamics enables the full potential of airbreathing to be realised. The SABRE engine which powers the SKYLON launch vehicle is an example of one of these so called 'Precooled hybrid airbreathing rocket engines' and the conceptual reasoning which leads to its main design parameters are described in the paper.

ID CONSTRAINTS
AB A comprehensive treatment to the optimal atmospheric ascent problem of launch vehicles subject to path constraints and final condition constraints is presented. The development is particularly tailored for the purpose of the eventual realization of closed-loop endoatmospheric ascent guidance. It is demonstrated that the classical finite difference method for two-point boundary-value problems is well suited for solving the optimal ascent problem onboard. The performance and execution of the guidance algorithm are assessed with a series of open-loop and closed-loop tests using the vehicle data of a reusable launch vehicle. The test results render strong supporting evidence to the belief that closed-loop optimal endoatmospheric ascent guidance is now feasible.

AB Optimizations of stiffened shells with different stiffener shapes performed to rank and identify the optimum designs during the preliminary design trade studies require a large number of analyses and hence rely on the use of efficient but approximate analysis methods. In the design of shells, the treatment of imperfections on buckling loads and stresses is of paramount importance. It is demonstrated how conservativeness of the approximate analyses used in buckling load calculation, the number of variables optimized (design freedom), and nonstructural constraints influence the "eight of optimum designs. This demonstration is based on the results of a trade study performed to compare minimum weight designs of stiffened shells optimized under stress and buckling constraints for a reusable launch vehicle tank. PANDA2 was selected for the present study because it uses approximate analysis procedures that permit the many thousands of structural analyses needed for global optimization and it also has sophisticated machinery for generating imperfections and accounting for their effects. Optimum weights were influenced not only by material choice, number of optimization variables, and manufacturing constraints, but also by the analysis model conservativeness. Optimization of shells with effect of initial imperfections exhibited substantial weight differences between different stiffened-shell concepts, partly because of conservativeness in the analysis.

AB A variety of reusable launch vehicle concepts has been designed and analyzed within the scope of the Future European Space Transportation Investigations Program systems study, which has been performed under a contract of the ESA by a joint European industry team. The designs under consideration included reusable two-stage-to-orbit configurations as well as several reusable single-stage-to-orbit vehicles with cryogenic rocket propulsion. All concepts were based on unified requirements, standards, technology assumptions, and design tools. To verify the consistency of the design process and to ensure the compatibility of the achieved results, as well as to identify. the relative merits and inherent characteristics of the different basic vehicle concepts, a comparative technical assessment was performed among the various designs themselves as well as in relation to analogous configurations from other programs found in the open literature. Whereas the performance relations between the designs generated under common ground rules were found to be plausible, discrepancies in comparison to other programs could be traced to differences in requirements, technology assumptions, and design approaches. The results of associated considerations with respect to the main vehicle characteristics and related performance parameters are presented.

AB A methodology for very fast design of three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) entry trajectories subject to all common inequality and equality constraints is developed. The approach makes novel use of the quasi-equilibrium glide phenomenon in lifting entry as a centerpiece for effective and efficient enforcement of the inequality constraints. The highly constrained nonlinear trajectory planning problem is decomposed into two sequential one-parameter search problems. The algorithm is able to generate a complete and feasible 3DOF entry trajectory of 25-min flight time in about 2-3 s on a desktop computer, given the entry conditions, values of constraint parameters, and final conditions. High-fidelity numerical simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various entry missions and trajectory planning using the space shuttle model are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB Revolutionary changes in how cargo and people are transported into space are needed to enable the affordable development and exploration of space in the 21st century. Diverse efforts to achieve major, but incremental Earth-to-orbit (ETO) improvements in the relatively near term have been undertaken in recent years in the US, including the Department of Defense evolved,expendable launch vehicle system development project. The NASA-industry reusable launch vehicle (RLV) program is addressing this challenge for the mid-term. The RLV program will validate the technology to enable industry to develop all-rocket reusable launch systems that can deliver payloads from the current Civil Needs Data Base in the 20,000-40,000 pounds class and smaller to low Earth orbit (LEO) at costs. of approximately $1000-$2000 per pound. This represents a factor of 5 (or more) reduction below existing launch services. This "next generation" improvement in launch capability is a vital element of the US National Space Transportation policy for current and planned government and commercial payloads.
   The longer-term challenge is also being addressed. During 1995-1997, NASA conducted the highly reusable space transportation (HRST) study project to address the longer-term challenge: how to achieve an additional factor of 10 reduction in launch costs-to approximately $100-$200 per payload pound to LEO-thus enabling a revolutionary expansion of space activity and enterprise. The HRST study has identified a "grand strategy" for achieving these cost goals, based on pursuing a revolutionary advance in main propulsion architectures and technology for ETO systems to enable a dramatic improvements in subsystem operability. The HRST study has examined diverse approaches, including combination propulsion systems, combined cycle propulsion, launch assist systems, and revolutionary rocket propulsion. An integrated assessment has been conducted, including both the concepts defined as part of the study as well as past concepts. This assessment suggests that the cost goals of HRST are achievable within the next 10-20 years if appropriate technology investments are pursued. This paper provides a summary report on the results and findings of the HRST study project. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A method of stretching optical fiber holds interest for measuring strain in smart structures where the physical displacement may be used to tune optical fiber lasers. A small, lightweight, tunable fiber laser is ideal for demodulating strain in optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) attached to smart structures such as the reusable launch vehicle that is being developed by NASA. A method is presented for stretching optical fibers using the thin-layer composite unimorph ferroelectric driver and sensor (THUNDER) piezoelectric actuators invented at NASA Langley Research Center. THUNDER actuators use a piezoelectric layer bonded to a metal backing to enable the actuators to produce displacements larger than the unbonded piezoelectric material. The shift in reflected optical wavelength resulting from stretching the FBG is presented. Means of adapting THUNDER actuators for stretching optical fibers are discussed, including ferrules, ferrule clamp blocks, and plastic hinges made with stereo lithography.

AB As part of phase 2 of the X-33 Program, NASA selected an integrated lifting body/aerospike engine configuration as the study vehicle for the conceptual analysis of a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle. A team at NASA Langley Research Center participated in the screening and evaluation of a number of proposed vehicle configurations in the early phases of the conceptual design process. The performance analyses that supported these studies were conducted to assess the effect of the vehicle's lifting capability, linear aerospike engine, and metallic thermal protection system on the weight and performance of the vehicle. These performance studies were conducted in a multidisciplinary fashion that indirectly linked the trajectory optimization with weight estimation and aerothermal analysis tools. This approach was necessary to develop optimized ascent and entry trajectories that met all vehicle design constraints. Significant improvements in ascent performance were achieved when the vehicle Hew a lifting trajectory and varied the engine mixture ratio during flight. Also, a considerable reduction in empty weight was possible by adjusting the total oxidizer-to-fuel and liftoff thrust-to-weight ratios. However, the optimal ascent flight profile had to be altered to ensure that the vehicle could be trimmed in pitch using only the How diverting capability of the aerospike engine. Likewise, the optimal entry trajectory had to be tailored to meet thermal protection system heating rate and transition constraints while satisfying a crossrange requirement.

AB The paper deals first with the definition and understanding of "Development Costs" in general. Usually there is large difference between 'initial "development cost guesses", "Proposal Cost Estimations" and the final "Cost-to-Completion". The reasons for the usual development cost increases during development are discussed. The second part discusses the range of historic launch systems' development costs under "Business-as-Usual" (BaU) - Conditions and potential cost reductions for future developments of RLVs, as well as the comparison to commercial. industrial development cost.
   Part three covers the potential reduction of development cost by application of "Cost Engineering Principles". An example of the large potential cost range (between 6 and 17 Billion USD) for the development of the same winged rocket-propelled SSTO launch vehicle concept is presented. Finally the tremendous development cost differences are shown which exist for the different potential Reusable Launch System Options which are under discussion. There remains an unresolved problem between the primary goals of the national space agencies with emphasis on new technology development/national prestige and the commercial market requirement of a simple low-cost RLV-System.

TI First-stage design variations of partially reusable launch vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Different types of reusable first stages designed for a near-term application with heavy lift launchers are investigated. The attached reference expendable space transportation system is a future Ariane 5 with cryogenic core and upper stage but skipped solid rocket boosters. The design of the so-called liquid flyback boosters is restricted to the incorporation of powerful hydrogen or hydrocarbon rocket motors already under development or in operation. The analyzed layout variants of the reusable vehicle include single- as well as dual-booster configurations. Catamaran-type double fuselage stages are investigated to evaluate the potential in reducing the unsymmetrical thrust load of one-side-mounted booster. Along with their primary use to boost heavy lift geostationary transfer-orbit missions, a second task may be covered by the same vehicle to accelerate the upper stages of small and medium launchers. The additional design requirements in such a dual-use reusable launch vehicle are studied. The investigation includes trajectory simulations and optimizations for ascent, as well as an assessment of propellant requirements and vehicle loads during return flight to the launch site. Critical flight stability aspects are evaluated by static and dynamic simulations. A comparison of size and mass is included, as well as performance data of the different liquid flyback booster configurations. The relevant rocket engine figures of performance, mass, reusability, and throttling capability are presented.

TI Optimized solutions for Kistler K-1 branching trajectories using
   multidisciplinary design optimization techniques
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle designs that incorporate branching trajectories during their ascent are of current interest in the advanced launch vehicle design community. Unlike expendable vehicle designs, the booster of a two-stage reusable system must fly to a designated landing site after staging. Because of a mutual dependence on the staging conditions, both the booster flyback branch and the orbital branch of the ascent trajectory must be simultaneously optimized to achieve an overall system objective. The optimum solution is often a compromise between the local objectives of the two branches. Current and notable designs in this class include the U.S. Air Force Space Operations Vehicle designs, the Kelly Astroliner, the Kistler K-1, and NASA's proposed liquid flyback booster designs (space shuttle booster replacement). Solution techniques are introduced that are well suited to solving this class of problem with existing single-segment trajectory optimization codes. In particular, these methods originate from the field of multidisciplinary design optimization and include optimization-based decomposition and collaborative optimization. The results of applying these techniques to the branching trajectory optimization problem for the Kistler K-I launch vehicle are given and conclusions are drawn with respect to computational efficiency and quality of the results. In general, partial optimization-based decomposition was preferred due to its superior robustness, ease of setup, fast execution time, and optimality of the results.

AB Recently, there has been an increased need for evolved space transportation and the research of reusable rocket which enable low cost and high reliability and is generating a lot of interest all over the world. In the USA, the development of reusable launch vehicle "Venture Star" which will be used instead of space shuttle is planned and its half scale model "X-33" was developed for the first flight in 1999. In Japan, there has been agreement on the main points to develop the rocket type RLV based on the technology of H-IIA, HOPE-X before developing space plane type RLV. The planned reusable rocket engine was LOX/LH2 as propellant, has 100-200 ton thrust and has a throttling capability. In addition, long life and high reliability are required for the engine system including LOX/LH2 turbopump.
   The paper introduces some key technologies for the reusable turbopump which IHI is promoting for research and development with NAL and Tohoku University. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A unique high-temperature modal test and model correlation/update program has been performed on the composite nozzle of the FASTRAC engine for the NASA X34 reusable launch vehicle. The program was required to provide an accurate high-temperature model of the nozzle for incorporation into the engine system structural dynamics model for loads calculation; this model is significantly different from the ambient case due to the large decrease in composite stiffness properties due to heating. The high-temperature modal test was performed during a hot-fire test of the nozzle. Previously, a series of high-fidelity modal tests and finite element model correlation of the nozzle in a free-free configuration had been performed. This model was then attached to a modal-test verified model of the engine hot-fire test stand, and the ambient system mode shapes were identified. A reduced set of accelerometers was then attached to the nozzle, the engine fired full duration, and the frequency peaks corresponding to the ambient nozzle modes individually isolated and tracked as they decreased during the test. To update the finite element model of the nozzle to these frequency curves, the percentage differences of the anisotropic composite moduli due to temperature variation from ambient, which had been used in the initial modeling and which were obtained by small sample coupon testing, were multiplied by an iteratively determined constant factor. These new properties were used to create high-temperature nozzle models corresponding to 10-s engine operation increments and tied into the engine system model for loads determination.

AB The ablution, mechanical and thermal properties of vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) (Pyrograf III(TM) Applied Sciences, Inc.)/phenolic resin (SC-1008, Borden Chemical, Inc.) composites were evaluated to determine the potential of using this material in solid rocket motor nozzles. Composite specimens with varying VGCF loadings (30-50% wt.) including one sample with ex-rayon carbon fiber plies were prepared and exposed to a plasma torch for 20 s with a heat flux of 16.5 MW/m(2) at approximately 1650degreesC. Low erosion rates and little char formation were observed, confirming that these materials were promising for rocket motor nozzle materials. When fiber loadings increased, mechanical properties and ablative properties improved. The VGCF composites had low thermal conductivities (approximately 0.56 W/ m-K) indicating they were good insulating materials. If a 65% fiber loading in VGCF composite could be achieved, then ablative properties are projected to be comparable to or better than the composite material currently used on the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM).

AB Four approaches are presented to configuring large, all-rocket, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicles for delivering heavy payloads to low Earth orbit. The payload capability for each configuration is 176,000 lb launched due east into a 220-n mile circular orbit. This capability was chosen so as to be comparable to the payload capability of the shuttle-derived Magnum expendable heavy lift launch vehicle concept characterized by NASA. In the first option presented, a reusable, winged stage is used to boost a parallel burn, expendable core stage to low Earth orbit. For the second option, both the booster and orbiter are winged, fully reusable stages. The third option differs from the second only in the fuel type used by the booster stage. The fourth configuration differs in that the winged, reusable orbiter utilizes an expendable payload shroud, rather than an internal payload bay. Its forward shroud is mounted to the orbiter's nose structure via a special structural attachment. Results indicate that a heavy-lift Earth-to-orbit strategy should consider using a shared reusable booster. The booster should be a common component of another two-stage-to-orbit launch system, to boost smaller core stages. This would allow recouping the boosters' initial nonrecurring costs across a larger number of missions and programs.

AB A new methodology is developed for assessing the risk associated with launching satellites in space by use of Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs). The objective is to assess the Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) for third party insurance purposes, which is a requirement for licensing of private operators. Launch industry convention has been to execute an MPL analysis for each and every flight. With the advent of commercial, reusable launch vehicle services, much higher flight rates are anticipated. Consequently a method for developing a conservative, 'once-and-for-all' MPL value is desirable. Failures during the boost, orbital vehicle, and return phases of the flight that could lead to impact of the rocket or its stages on the ground are considered. Simple geometric models are used to evaluate an upper bound to the probability that assets of various form and size on the ground will be hit by a stray rocket or vehicle stage. Models for the loss resulting from hitting an asset are also developed. The methodology is applied to a proposed launch site in Southern Australia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID HIGH-ENTHALPY; COMPRESSION CORNER; WAVE
AB Shock-wave/turbulent boundary-layer interactions in the presence of thermal and chemical nonequilibrium. phenomena are analyzed. The approach relies on a linear eddy viscosity two-equation turbulence modeling that accounts for the coupling of turbulence with chemistry and vibration, and it employs a total variation diminishing finite volume numerical methodology. The capability of the model has first been assessed for a cylinder flare configuration, and results have been compared with experiments. The model has then been applied to assess the aerodynamic performance of control surfaces of a reusable launch vehicle. In particular, the effects of wall temperature and flap deflection on the separation, aerothermal loads, and flap efficiency have been studied. The analysis shows that turbulence becomes important for flap deflection angles greater than a critical value [O (15 deg)], thus avoiding the crisis of the flap efficiency that is observed under laminar conditions and extending the operating capabilities of the control surface. The study also shows that the wall temperature affects significantly the efficiency and the operating envelope of the flap primarily under turbulent conditions.

TI Half model restrictions for linear plug nozzle testing
SO AIAA JOURNAL

DT Article
AB Linear plug nozzles have been receiving more attention since the development of the single stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle. To clarify the fundamental features of linear plug nozzle flow, experiments have been performed with half models because the design of the plug nozzle is symmetric. Experimental and numerical results are presented to investigate the usefulness of a half model design. The experiments were conducted on a half model without external flow and with an external flow at a Mach number of M(infinity) = 2. The results have been used to validate computations using Navier-Stokes equations provided with a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model and a Degani-Schiff correction. For comparison computations were performed for a full model subjected to the same conditions. For all of these conditions, the effects of increasing or decreasing pressure ratio have been taken into account.

DT Article
AB France and Russia have an ongoing fruitful cooperation to jointly develop a wide-range ramjet (WRR) able to accelerate a reusable launch vehicle from similar to Mach 3 to Mach 12. The WRR engine has a fully variable internal geometry, which enables a high performance level over the whole Mach-number range. Propulsion-oriented system studies have been conducted both on 30-tons-class experimental flight vehicle and on 500 tons-class single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable vehicles. In particular, the WRR airbreathing propulsion system has been integrated into a SSTO generic vehicle. Then, trajectory simulation, using mass, propulsion, and aerodynamic models, has allowed determining the payload as a function of total takeoff weight, confirming the utility of the variable geometry features of the WRR. Preliminary experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for several years to design the WRR prototype. The present contribution describes the synthesis of this engine and provides an overview of this common work. Consideration is given to various aspects of the project, including system studies, technology development, and analyses using contour control codes.

AB Predicted performance and features of a combined propulsion concept for a small reusable launch vehicle known as KLIN (TM) (meaning wedge in Russian) Cycle are discussed. The KLIN Cycle consists of a thermally integrated deeply cooled turbojet and a liquid rocket engine. The objective of this concept is to achieve a high-pressure ratio in a simple, lightweight turbojet engine. The proven result is an exceptional engine thrust-to-weight ratio, as well as improved specific impulse and mass fraction of the launcher. When based on the RL10 engine family, the KLIN Cycle makes a small single-stage-to-orbit and two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles feasible and very economically attractive.

AB Neutral atomic oxygen (AO)-the dominant atmospheric species at typical low Earth orbit altitudes-is responsible for the erosion, or other degradation, of many satellite materials. Therefore, AO has become an important consideration for spacecraft designers and manufacturers. The study of AO is also of interest to atmospheric physicists because it is involved in many of the chemical reactions occurring naturally in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Both these groups rely on atmospheric models for computer-based simulation and prediction of atomic oxygen concentrations. Such models require, or are enhanced by, empirical input data-that is, actual measurements of AO number densities. A review is presented of the different measurement techniques that, to date, have been used on satellites and sounding rockets to perform AO studies. Rather than reporting results from every sensor application, this article takes a more general view of the experimental methods, using example devices to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. New or promising equipment, or techniques that could be exploited for performing such measurements, are also described. We attempt some semiquantitative comparison of the techniques, although the most appropriate experimental method for any given flight opportunity depends heavily on the mission conditions and science goals. Our emphasis is on missions where the available mass and power are limited. In these situations the most suitable established device is probably that of the thin film actinometer. If more risk can be assumed then a more promising, but as yet unqualified, method is that of the fiber-optic reflectance sensor. However, since both these devices are nonreusable, it is shown that semiconducting sensors may be better for long duration, mass- and power-limited applications.

AB A high assurance on-line recovery technology for a space on-board computer that can be realized using commercial devices is proposed whereby a faulty processor node confirms its normality and then recovers without affecting the other processor nodes in operation. Also, the result of an evaluation test using the breadboard model implementing this technology is reported. Because this technology enables simple and assured recovery of a faulty processor node regardless of its degree of redundancy, it can be applied to various applications, such as a launch vehicle, a satellite, and a reusable launch vehicle. As a result, decreasing the cost of an on-board computer is possible while maintaining its high reliability.

ID DAMAGE-MITIGATING CONTROL; SYSTEMS
AB The conceptual development and a design methodology are presented for life-extending control where the objective is to achieve high performance and structural durability of complex dynamic systems. A life-extending controller is designed for a reusable rocket engine via damage mitigation in both the fuel (H-2) and oxidizer (O-2) turbine blades while satisfying the dynamic performance requirements of the combustion chamber pressure and O-2/H-2 mixture ratio. The design procedure makes use of a combination of linear and nonlinear techniques and also allows adaptation of the life-extending controller module to augment a conventional performance controller of the rocket engine. The nonlinear part of the controller is designed by optimizing selected parameters in a prescribed dynamic structure of damage compensation.

TI X-33 experimental aeroheating at Mach 6 using phosphor thermography
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
ID SHUTTLE
AB The goal of the NASA reusable launch vehicle technology program is to mature and demonstrate essential, cost-effective technologies for next-generation launch systems. The X-33 flight vehicle presently being developed by Lockheed Martin is an experimental single-stage-to-orbit demonstrator that seeks to validate critical technologies and ensure applicability to a full-scale reusable launch vehicle. As with the design of any hypersonic vehicle, the aeroheating environment is an important issue, and one of the key technologies being demonstrated on X-33 is an advanced metallic thermal protection system. As part of the development of this thermal protection system, the X-33 aeroheating environment is being defined through conceptual analysis, ground-based testing, and computational fluid dynamics. An overview of the hypersonic aeroheating wind-tunnel program conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center in support of the ground-based testing activities is provided. Global surface heat transfer images, surface streamline patterns, and shock shapes were measured on 0.013 scale (10-in.) ceramic models of the proposed X-33 configuration in Mach 6 air. The test parametrics include angles of attack from -5 to 40 deg, unit Reynolds numbers from I x 10(6) to 8 x 10(6)/ft, and body-flap deflections of 0, 10, and 20 deg. Experimental and computational results indicate the presence of shock/shock interactions that produced localized heating on the deflected flaps and boundary-layer transition on the canted fins. Comparisons of the experimental data to laminar and turbulent predictions were performed. Laminar windward heating data from the wind tunnel was extrapolated to flight surface temperatures and generally compared to within 50 degreesF of flight prediction along the centerline. When coupled with the phosphor technique, this rapid extrapolation method would serve as an invaluable thermal protection system design tool.

TI X-33 hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, under a cooperative agreement with NASA, will design, build, and fly the X-33, a half-scale prototype of a rocket-based, single-stage-to-orbit, reusable launch vehicle. A 0.007-scale model of the X-33 604B0002G configuration was tested in five supersonic/hypersonic facilities at the NASA Langley Research Center to examine vehicle aerodynamic characteristics and to establish the aerodynamic flight database for the hypersonic regime. Effects of Mach number and specific heat ratio on hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics were also studied. These results were complemented with computational aerodynamic data, experimental configuration buildup information, and various types of surface and flowfield visualizations to enhance the understanding of experimentally observed aerodynamic trends. Data at both Mach 6 and Mach 10 show the baseline configuration achieves a maximum hypersonic LID of approximately 1.2 between 20 and 30 deg angle of attack. With the center-of-gravity location at 66% of vehicle reference length, the configuration was found to be longitudinally controllable with less than half of the total body flap deflection capability across the angle of attack range at both Mach 6 and Mach 10. The vehicle also was shown to be longitudinally stable or neutrally stable for typical (greater than 20 deg) hypersonic flight attitudes. At Mach 6 and Mach 10, the baseline configuration demonstrated positive dihedral effect (roll stability) but was directionally unstable. Effects of Mach number on longitudinal aerodynamics were shown to be small relative to X-33 control authority. Effects of specific heat ratio on vehicle pitching moment characteristics were shown to be significant at higher angles of attack, but with a maximum flight Mach number of approximately 10, real-gas phenomena are not expected to occur for the X-33's suborbital flights.

TI Mars rocket vehicle using in situ propellants
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Mars In-Situ Propellants Rocket (MIPR) is a small vehicle proposed to fly autonomously on Mars, using in-situ propellant production to manufacture rocket propellant directly out of the Martian atmosphere, thus demonstrating the feasibility of using local resources to "live off the land." It is proposed as a payload on a Mars Surveyor class lander as a reusable "hopper" vehicle. The vehicle explores the Martian surface under rocket power and can repeatedly take off and land, carrying a suite of science instruments over a range of hundreds of meters to several kilometers per hop. The flight demonstration will accomplish a range of technology objectives important to both unmanned probes and to future human missions, including demonstration of a suborbital Mars launch vehicle, demonstrating storage of cryogenic propellants on the Mars surface, demonstration of a pressure-fed cryogenic propulsion system for Mars ascent vehicles, demonstration of a lightweight space engine, and use for the first time of propellants manufactured in situ on another planetary body. In addition to these technology objectives, the MIPR vehicle can carry a science payload that will advance our understanding of the surface and atmosphere of Mars.

TI Comparison of glideback and flyback boosters
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB The aim of the present study is to investigate alternative reusable launch vehicle concepts and to provide a comparison of two different vehicle configurations. The first concept vehicle uses airbreathing engines to perform a powered booster flyback mission, whereas the second concept employs only aerodynamic lift to achieve booster flyback. The optimization software employs a system parameter optimization, in conjunction with a trajectory parameter optimization, to calculate the optimal mass split and corresponding optimal trajectory, A reference mission is used to compare launch vehicle payloads for a fixed gross liftoff weight, assuming launch from Woomera Prohibited Area, South Australia. The payload for a vehicle using a powered flyback strategy is found to be considerably higher than that obtained by a vehicle employing an aerodynamic glide return flight.

AB The goal of life extending control (LEC) is to enhance structural durability of complex mechanical systems, such as aircraft, spacecraft, and energy conversion devices, without incurring any significant loss of performance. This paper presents a concept of robust life-extending controller design for reusable rocket engines, similar to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), via damage mitigation in both fuel and oxidiser turbines: while achieving the required performance for transient responses of the main combustion chamber pressure and the oxidant/fuel mixture ratio. The design procedure makes use of a combination of linear robust control synthesis and nonlinear optimisation techniques. Results of simulation experiments on the model of a reusable rocket engine are presented to this effect.

AB Advanced launch systems studies are ongoing at MAN Technologie AG, Karlsfeld, Germany, contributing to a broader European effort that is examining options for the next space transportation system to be developed there. One promising candidate that uses medium-term technologies is a vertical takeoff semireusalale launch vehicle featuring a reusable booster and an expendable core stage. The dedicated design of fully cryogenic stages enables the launch vehicle concept to bring up to geostationary transfer orbit a payload mass of up to 10 Mg and a low-Earth-orbit mass of 20 Mg. The total liftoff mass is about 520 Mg. This launch vehicle concept proposal could culminate in a fully reusable launch vehicle, a booster and an orbiter stage, for Europe in the long term. The status of the studied launch vehicle concept is summarized. The design features and trade topics leading to the semireusable launch vehicle concept are shown. The selected semireusable launch vehicle is presented as a viable interim step between existing expendable launch vehicles and fully reusable launch vehicles.

TI Space transfer-vehicle concept for deploying solar-power satellites
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB A 200-kW-class solar-electric orbital transfer-vehicle concept, Swarm, for deploying elements of future, very large solar-power satellites, has been developed. Swam is preintegrated with its payload on the ground and delivered into low Earth orbit aboard a reusable launch vehicle. The total mass initially deployed to an equatorial low Earth orbit is assumed to be 40 metric tons (mt)-divided roughly evenly between the transfer vehicle and its payload. The Swam? vehicle ferries the payload to geostationary orbit (GEO) in approximately 116 days using low-thrust Krypton thrusters powered by six large solar arrays. Once at GEO. the Swam? vehicle is disassembled to provide thrusters and propellant tanks for solar-power satellite station keeping. At an estimated mass of 20,000 mt per solar-power satellite and a nominal deployment rate of one satellite per year, over 1,000 one-way Swarm flights per year are required. Preliminary mass estimates for the Swarm transfer vehicle have been developed. A cost-estimating methodology suggests that further improvements are needed to achieve an acceptable cost for in-space transportation.

CY OCT 02-06, 2000
CL RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL
AB Perhaps the most substantial single obstacle to progress of space exploration and utilization of space for human benefit is the safety & reliability and the inherent cost of launching to, and returning from, space. The primary influence in the high costs of current launch systems (the same is true for commercial and military aircraft and most other reusable systems) is the operations, maintenance and infrastructure portion of the program's total life cycle costs. Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) maintenance and design have traditionally been two separate engineering disciplines with often conflicting objectives - maximizing ease of maintenance versus optimizing performance, size and cost. Testability analysis, an element of Informed Maintenance (IM), has been an ad hoc, manual effort, in which maintenance engineers attempt to identify an efficient method of troubleshooting for the given product, with little or no control over product design. Therefore, testability deficiencies in the design cannot be rectified. It is now widely recognized that IM must be engineered into the product at the design stage itself, so that an optimal compromise is achieved between system maintainability and performance.
   The elements of IM include testability analysis, diagnostics/prognostics, automated maintenance scheduling, automated logistics coordination, paperless documentation and data mining. IM derives its heritage from complimentary NASA science, space and aeronautic enterprises such as the on-board autonomous Remote Agent Architecture recently flown on NASA's Deep Space 1 Probe as well as commercial industries that employ quick turnaround operations. Commercial technologies and processes supporting NASA's IM initiatives include condition based maintenance technologies from Boeing's Commercial 777 Aircraft and Lockheed-Martin's F-22 Fighter, automotive computer diagnostics and autonomous controllers that enable 100,000 mile maintenance free operations, and locomotive monitoring system software.
   This paper will summarize NASA's long-term strategy, development, and implementation plans for Informed Maintenance for next generation RLVs. This will be done through a convergence into a single IM vision the work being performed throughout NASA, industry and academia. Additionally, a current status of IM development throughout NASA programs such as the Space Shuttle, X-33, X-34 and X-37 will be provided and will conclude with an overview of near-term work that is being initiated in FY00 to support NASA's 2(nd) Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle Program.

AB New robust Right control laws are developed for a reusable launch vehicle. The wide range of Right conditions, and the impossibility to obtain wind-tunnel data for most of the Right domain, requires using a robust control technique. The use of linear-adaptive control techniques to design the trajectory autopilot and to solve the inversion problem is proposed. Subspace-stabilization techniques are used to design the inner loop of control, which controls the vehicle attitude, The control is structured in two layers, The outer layer plays the role of an automatic pilot offering two operational modes: a trajectory mode and an attitude mode. In the trajectory mode the Right path and ground track are controlled, and in the attitude mode the autopilot controls attitude angles. The commands generated by the automatic pilot are inverted, by the use of a new and rather novel algorithm, to determine the required pitching, Polling, and yawing rate commands, which are then tracked by the inner loop of control. The inversion implements either bank-to-turn or skid-to-turn steering. The linear-adaptive methodology circumvents the use of difficult nonlinear control techniques and attendant analysis uncertainties through the use of linear disturbance accommodation observers to estimate and cancel the combined effects of nonlinear and/or uncertain terms. Subspace-stabilization techniques are used to steer the, system error state to a certain subspace S representing the described or specified servotracking error behavior, while controlling the motion on the subspace S to the origin in error space. Some numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the closed-loop response, with the proposed flight-control law, accurately tracks the prescribed flight and ground track trajectories.

AB It is essential to utilize carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) for main structural materials of cryogenic propellant tanks in order to realize the drastic weight reduction needed for efficient reusable space transportation systems. Recently developed toughened CFRP materials, which are expected to show good cryogenic properties, are considered promising candidates for these kinds of applications. The present study investigates cryogenic properties of candidate materials and structural elements, including Y-joint structural models. 300 turn diameter filament wound tank and 600 mm diameter lay up tanks were fabricated and tested. Based on these experimental data, the feasibility of a CFRP cryogenic tank is discussed and future research tasks are proposed. This research is being conducted under the cooperation contract between NASDA and NAL.

AB The damage process of transverse cracks in quasi-isotropic CFRP laminates under quasistatic loading is studied. It is necessary to investigate the damage process of transverse cracks in order to apply CFRP composites to cryogenic fuel tanks of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). To investigate edge and specimen configuration effects on transverse cracks, coupon specimens with a range of specimen widths and transverse ply thicknesses are tested under tensile loads. Measurements of edge crack density and detailed observations of transverse crack propagation across the specimen width are made. The results suggest that transverse cracks initiate from free-edges and transverse ply thickness has significant effect on transverse crack propagation.

AB Human space flight represents a heady mix of bravery and drama which can be inspirational to nations and to humankind but at huge economic cost. Due to the current high launch costs only a handful of people have ventured beyond low Earth orbit and walked on the Moon, propelled by aspirations related more to the Cold War than to science. Problems with reusable launch vehicle development mean that severe launch cost limitations will exist for some time. Meanwhile, cheaper robotic probes have visited all the planets except Pluto, flown by comets, landed on Mars, Venus and an asteroid, have probed Jupiter's atmosphere and studied the Universe beyond our own solar system with telescopes. Using these data we are determining mankind's place in the Universe. Public interest in the historic Eros landing eclipsed a simultaneous space walk at the fledgling International Space Station and the Mars Pathfinder landing generated hundreds of millions of website hits in a few days. Given the fact that hundreds of Mars missions could be flown for the still-escalating cost of the International Space Station, the unsuitability of human bodies for deep space exploration, and the advances in 3-d and virtual reality techniques, we discuss whether human exploration needs a place in a realistic, useful and inspirational space programme.

AB We consider angular motion in atmosphere of return reusable descent flight vehicles (DFV) of unconventional aerodynamic configurations. a return space vehicle (RSV) as a two-cone axisymmetric body of rotation with a transverse symmetry plane (manufactured by joining bottom of two cases-warhead cones of ballistic rockets being removed from armament); a transforming recoverable carrier-rocket (RCR) as two identical bottom-butted carrier-rockets (joined along generators at the active leg and during de-orbiting and soft landing by means of hinges on bottoms and a lock in the upper part of the case); the carrier-rockets take the configuration close to a two-cone axisymmetric body of rotation with the transverse symmetry plane after de-orbiting at the section of approach and motion in dense atmosphere. When the equations of motion are derived using RSV as an example we take into account displacement of its center of masses along the longitudinal axis relative to the geometric center which is introduced to control DFV.

AB A fully reusable rocket vehicle is proposed to demonstrate good operability characteristics both un the ground and in flight. For achieving technical readiness for future space transportation systems, design considerations not only for higher-performance-related issues but also those for good operability are needed. The proposed vehicle is to be used as a sounding rocket and has the capabilities of ballistic flight, returning to the launch site, and landing vertically, making use of clustered liquid-hydrogen rocket engines. Before the development of this type of reusable rocket was initiated, a small test vehicle with a liquid-hydrogen rocket engine was built and flight tested. A demonstration of vertical landing and exercise of turnaround operation for repeated flights are the major objectives of the test vehicle. Two flights were performed in succession, and the flight-test operation provided many valuable experiences for designing the fully reusable rocket vehicle.

AB A key element of the President's Vision for Space Exploration is the development of a new space transportation system to replace Shuttle that will enable manned exploration of the moon, Mars, and beyond. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has created the Constellation Program to develop this architecture, which includes the Ares launch vehicle and Orion manned spacecraft. The Orion spacecraft must carry six astronauts and its primary structure should be reusable, if practical. These requirements led the Constellation Program to consider a baseline land landing on return to earth. To assess the landing system options for Orion, a review of current operational parachute landing systems such as those used for the F-111 escape module and the Soyuz is performed. In particular, landing systems with airbags and retrorockets that would enable reusability of the Orion capsule are investigated. In addition, Apollo tests and analyses conducted in the 1960s for both water and land landings are reviewed. Finally, test data and dynamic finite-element simulations are presented to understand land landings for the Orion spacecraft.

AB At the beginning of the seventies, experimental research using short duration supersonic shock driven wind tunnel were conducted and showed the efficiency of Lorentz force action on supersonic (Mach 1.4) dense (1 bar) low magnetic Reynolds number hot (10000 K) argon flows. When working as a generator, the linear Faraday MHD converter was efficient enough, due to high electrical conductivity (3000 S/m) to create a front shock wave at the intake of the constant cross-section MHD converter. Accelerations up to 5000 m/s were obtained in 10 cm long channels. This suggested the possibility to achieve complete shock wave and turbulent wake cancellation, through MHD bypass concept. Such work gave publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentation in international MHD meetings (French Academy of Sciences 1970, Moscow 1983, Tsukuba 1986, Beijing 1992). The work was conducted both through computational simulations (based on the method of characteristics) and hydraulic simulation experiments. We present the synthesis of such studies through a project of a hypersonic vehicle based on an MHD bypass concept, landing under its own steam, using classical turbojets. Then, at Mach 3 and high altitude, MHD controlled inlets axe opened. A wall converter slows down the hypersonic incoming air flow, without excessive heating, feeding a ramjet system. The subsequent electric power provides an additional impulse to the flow in the exhaust section. Cruise Mach number: 12. Local Hall parameter regime produces high voltage that, sent to the leading edges, creates a plasma cushion which prevents too high thermal flux. Lift is provided by wave riding technique. Additional rocket propeller could transform it as a reusable space launcher.

AB This paper presents the results of the first DEIMOS Liquid Methane/Oxygen rocket engine test campaign. DEIMOS is an acronym for 'Delft Experimental Methane Oxygen propulsion System'. It is a project performed by students under the auspices of DARE (Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering). The engine provides a theoretical design thrust of 1800 N and specific impulse of 287 s at a chamber pressure of 40 bar with a total mass flow of 637 g/s. It has links to sustainable development, as the propellants used are one of the most promising so-called 'green propellants'-combinations, currently under scrutiny by the industry, and the engine is designed to be reusable. This paper reports results from the provisional tests, which had the aim of verifying the engine's ability to fire, and confirming some of the design assumptions to give confidence for further engine designs. Measurements before and after the tests are used to determine first estimates on feed pressures, propellant mass flows and achieved thrust. These results were rather disappointing from a performance point of view, with an average thrust of a mere 3.8% of the design thrust, but nonetheless were very helpful. The reliability of ignition and stability of combustion are discussed as well. An initial assessment as to the reusability, the flexibility and the adaptability of the engine was made. The data provides insight into (methane/oxygen) engine designs, leading to new ideas for a subsequent design. The ultimate goal of this project is to have all operational rocket and to attempt to set all amateur altitude record.

AB To accurately predict the overall ignition transient for the reusable solid rocket motors of the space shuttle booster with head-end fin slots, it is necessary to have the knowledge of the flame-spreading rates in the fin-slot region. This paper is the second of a two part study and deals with the development of a flame-spreading correlation in the fin-slot region. A subscale (1:10) pie-shaped fin-slot motor was designed to perform diagnostic measurements for studying the flame-spreading behavior on the exposed propellant surface. Dynamic similarity was considered in the igniter design so the impinging jet had a similar exit angle onto the propellant surface in the fin-slot section. Flame-spreading measurements were gathered using a high-speed digital camera and nonintrusive optical measurement methods through an array of 36 near-infrared fast-response photodetectors; installed perpendicular to representative regions of the propellant surface. Results showed that the flame-spreading phenomena was highly nonuniform, starting in the downstream portion of the fin-slot region before traveling back toward the igniter. A correlation was developed for the dimensionless flame-spreading time interval showing that it was inversely proportional to the pressurization rate to a power of 0.62, which depends strongly upon the flow parameters of the igniter induced flow and local propellant grain geometry.

AB Composite materials are actively being used in the aerospace industry as a means of reducing weight. In particular, polymer matrix composites (PMC) are good candidates due to their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. A fundamental step to understand how a PMC will behave in a cryotank's extreme environmental is to first understand how the constituents (namely, the polymer matrix) behave in that same environment. Therefore, both stress-based and fracture-based experiments were conducted to evaluate four candidate polymers supplied by NASA Langley Research Center. Each type of test was conducted at approximately -196 degrees C (-320 degrees F), 24 degrees C (76 degrees F), and 160 degrees C (320 degrees F). Based on the results of the four polymer systems, a recommendation as to the best candidate for polymer matrix and adhesive bonding for Reusable Launch Vehicle's (RLV's) composite cryotanks is made.

AB To accurately predict the overall ignition transient for the reusable solid rocket motor of the space shuttle booster with head-end fin slots, it is necessary to acquire detailed flowfield structure and energy transfer rates on the exposed inert fin-slot propellant surfaces. This paper is the first of a two-part study and deals with the Internal flowfield structure and heat-transfer characteristics In the fin-slot region, A subscale (1: 10) pie-shaped fin-slot motor was designed to perform diagnostic measurements. An array of 36 flush-mounted heat-flux gauges was installed to detect file local temperature-rise rates at representative regions perpendicular to the propellant surface. Flowfield visualizations were conducted by applying either a chalk-powder/kerosene mixture or many small threads taped to various locations on file inner surface or the sacrificial window or the fin-slot region for high-speed video camera recording. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for modeling the internal flowfield of the test rig. Results were used to develop it hod-transfer correlation governed by the internal flowfield structure within the fin-slot region. The theoretically calculated and experimentally observed internal flowfield patterns were similar in nature. The heat-transfer rates determined front the developed correlation matched the measured data trend within the experimental error. The flowfield structure and heat-transfer rate distribution are mainly governed by the major recirculating flow induced by the igniter jet.

TI Trajectory Analysis for Vertical Takeoff and Vertical Landing Reusable
   Launch Vehicle's Upper Stage
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English

ID ASCENT GUIDANCE; ENTRY GUIDANCE; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN
AB Reusable launch vehicles are a promising business for the future because of their flexibility, reliability, low cost, and good operability. There are two takeoff styles: the vertical takeoff and the horizontal takeoff. Compared to the horizontal takeoff vehicle, the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle has advantages, such as a shorter down-range landing, a quicker recovery system (wherein takeoff and landing happen in approximately the same location), and a lighter weight. A vertical profile is used for vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles to achieve a recovery at the launch site. However, the first stage of the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle (RLV) typically can provide a very small or even zero velocity to its second or upper stage, if the upper stage is released at the peak altitude. Therefore, primarily, this type of launch vehicle is used to achieve hundreds of seconds in a microgravity environment. The upper stage payload delivery capabilities of a vertical takeoff RLV and its potential applications are described from a trajectory point of view. A modified optimal control methodology and an intuitive method of the trajectory control, called energy for altitude and time, are used to determine the maximum throw distance, maximum flight time, and orbital insertion capabilities for certain payloads, separately. The results from this investigation show the possibilities of expanding the applications for the VTVL suborbital RLV.

ID ELLIPTIC SHAPE TRANSITION
AB Scramjet engines promise significantly higher specific impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase if low-Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difficulty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system Includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 6-12 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled final-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled In deliver approximately 100 log to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5 % with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efficient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most significant improvement to their use for space access.

AB The military is pursuing a low-cost, responsive reusable launch vehicle that can rapidly place payloads in orbit in response to national defense requirements. The reusable launch vehicle is currently in the early stages of its design phase, when it is critical to assess design alternatives in terms of their operational capabilities as well as their life cycle support requirements. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory developed the space access vehicles mission and operations simulation (SAVMOS) model suite to assist in evaluating the mission cycle of the reusable launch vehicle. Part of the functionality of SAVMOS is the maintenance, integration, and launch pad operations simulation and test (MILEPOST) model. MILEPOST allows the user to evaluate candidate designs and perform tradeoff studies for the impact of design characteristics on regeneration time and support personnel requirements. We discuss MILEPOST development and present insights on process time and workforce sizing for several design alternatives.

SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL

AB Space transportation remains in the pioneering stages. What might this century bring if we had a 'railroad to space' that embodied the characteristics of the transcontinental undertaking? The X-33 and Venture Star projects were one attempt to achieve the characteristics of that transcontinental railroad. There are others, here and in other Countries, but perhaps we need to begin with a smaller first step, a small, commercial reusable rocket with ballistic ascent to space altitude with a hypersonic glider return? Our challenge in space today is to develop vehicles that are in continuous use, maintained and operated on a fixed schedule despite weather or environmental hazards, which move payloads not only into space but back again. The X PRIZE was a $10 million prize awarded to Scaled Composites as the first privately financed spaceship that launched the equivalent of three persons to an altitude of at least 100 kilometers on two consecutive flights within two weeks. What about an analogous vehicle that flies two or three times a week, every week for a number of years? A major difference is that this challenge is to be accomplished without government support or government developed vehicles. The aerospace vehicle design (AVD) Laboratory team at the University of Texas at Arlington is developing a generic space access vehicle (SAV) design synthesis environment with focus on the conceptual design phase. The AVD Lab has applied elements of this toolbox to the study of a tourist aerospace vehicle under a grant from Rocketplane Limited, Inc. The development of a low-cost tourist vehicle based on the adaptation of a Learjet 25/35/45 series aircraft is the focus of this paper.

SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

ID LAUNCH VEHICLE; OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION
AB Data mining has been performed on the result,; of an aerodynamic design optimization of a two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle flyback-booster wing. Three data mining techniques were compared, including selforganizing map, functional analysis of variance, and the rough set theory. The optimization problem had four aerodynamic objective functions and 71 wing shape design variables. The hypothetical design database resulting from the optimization contained a total of 302 solutions which included 102 nondominated solutions. Consequently, the acquired knowledge of the design space consisted of general design characteristics, correlation between objective functions, and the effects of these design variables on the objective functions, for both nondominated as well as all solutions. The comparison also revealed the similarities and differences among the three data mining techniques used in this study. Even though all three techniques discovered detailed design knowledge and the results produced by the combination of all three methods compensated disadvantages of each method when applied individually, it was discovered that the self-organizing map produced the overall best results. Moreover, this study has also shown that the knowledge acquired from both nondominated solutions and from all solutions found was consistent despite the differences between the design spaces. Furthermore, it was shown that data mining is essential for visualizing results of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem and extracting useful design knowledge from these results.

   controller state; integrator
AB When a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) returns to earth, it flies just by gliding without thrust. In this phase, one of the most likely and important faults to occur in the airframe is a jamming of the elevon. To tolerate this failure, the flight control system must keep stability and performance during such a failure. One of the effective ways to overcome this problem is to switch the controllers based on the information of the detected failure in the plant. Generally speaking, the controller must have integrators so as to yield the zero steady-state error for the controlled Output even if there exist some perturbations in the plant dynamics. In this paper, the design of controller switching scenario is addressed especially focusing on the decision of the controller state at the instant of switching the controllers wit integrator. Then, the proposed switching scenario is applied to the control of ALFLEX (Automatic Landing FLight EXperiment), which is the automatic landing experimental vehicle being developed for RLV, considering the occurrence of the jamming fault. Some simulations are shown to verify the usefulness of the proposed idea. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A Ni-based superalloy honeycomb thermal protection system (TPS) panel has been fabricated. And a curved Ni-based superalloy honeycomb sandwich has also been fabricated. The preliminary thermal insulation results of a fabricated Ni-based superalloy honeycomb TPS panel (the areal density of this panel is 6.7 kg/m(2) and total height is 32mm) indicate that the maximum temperature of the lower surfaces of the panel is lower than 150 degrees C when the temperature of outer surface is held at 650 degrees C for 30 min. The flatwise tensile strength and compressive properties of a fabricated Ni-based superalloy honeycomb sandwich coupon was studied at room temperature. A multilayered coating has been developed on the surface of the superalloy honeycomb TIPS panel for environmental protection and thermal control. The oxidation weight-change results show that the weight change of the Ni-based superalloy honeycomb sandwich with the oxidation resistant coating is extremely small at 1100 degrees C in air for 10h. The emittance, layer of the multilayered coating imparts an emittance in excess of 0.85 during exposure at 850 degrees C, which was at least 14% greater than that of the substrate with oxidation resistant alone.

AB A computational modeling approach or method was developed for simulating 1) the release of the fuel and oxidizer from a launch vehicle, 2) the subsequent mixing of the fuel and oxidizer in the local on-pad environment of the launch vehicle, 3) the explosive potential or yield for the mixture plume, and 4) the detonation of the plume and the resulting collateral damage. The method uses a set of computer codes: specifically, a computational fluid dynamics code to predict vapor plume formation, a chemical-thermodynamic equilibrium code to predict vapor plume yield potential, and a hydrocode to predict explosion intensity and collateral damage. This method was successfully applied to the simulation of candidate reusable launch vehicles to assess crew-escape performance.

AB Schemes have been suggested for transferring energy from Earth-to-space, space-to-Earth, and space-to-space using high-power microwave (HPM) beams. All use power beaming. Microwave beams have been studied for propelling spacecraft for launch to orbit, orbit raising, launch from orbit into interplanetary and interstellar space, and deployment of large space structures. The microwave thermal rocket, called the "microwave thermal thruster," is a reusable single-stage vehicle that uses an HIM beam to provide power to a heat-exchanger propulsion system, with double the specific impulse of conventional rockets. Orbital missions include orbit raising and space solar power. Microwave-propelled sails are a new class of spacecraft that promises to revolutionize future space probes. Experiments and simulations have verified that sails riding beams can be stable on the beam for conical sail shapes. Beam-driven sail flights have now demonstrated the basic features of the beam-driven propulsion. Beams can also carry angular momentum and communicate it to a sail to help control it in flight. An early mission for microwave space propulsion is dramatically shortening the time needed for sails to escape Earth's orbit. A number of missions for beam-driven sails have been quantified for high-velocity mapping of the outer solar system, Kuiper Belt, the Heliopause, and the penultimate interstellar precursor mission. For large HIM systems at fixed effective isotropic radiated power, minimum capital cost is achieved when the cost is equally divided between antenna gain and radiated power. This is a driver when considering design of power-beaming systems such as interstellar Beacons, which the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence is searching for. Much of the technical means for these applications are already in hand. Microwave and millimeter-wave array antennas are already in use for astronomy; sources at high frequencies are being developed for fusion and the military. Development of high-power arrays is needed. A syn
