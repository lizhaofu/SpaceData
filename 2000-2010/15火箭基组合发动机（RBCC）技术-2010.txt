AB Acoustic instabilities with frequencies roughly higher than 1 kHz remain among the most harmful instabilities, able to drastically affect the operation of engines and even leading to the destruction of the combustion chamber. By Coupling with resonant transverse modes of the chamber, these pressure fluctuations can lead to a large increase of heat transfer fluctuations, as soon as fluctuations are in phase. To control engine stability, the mechanisms leading to the modulation of the local instantaneous rate of heat release must be understood. The commonly developed global approaches cannot identify the dominant mechanism(s) through which the acoustic oscillation modulates the local instantaneous rate of heat release. Local approaches are being developed based on processes that could be affected by acoustic perturbations. Liquid atomization is one of these processes. In the present paper, the effect of transverse acoustic perturbations on a coaxial air-assisted jet is studied experimentally. Here, five breakup regimes have been identified according to the flow conditions, in the absence of acoustics. The liquid Jet is placed either at a pressure anti-node or at a velocity anti-node of an acoustic field. Acoustic levels Up to 165 dB are produced. At a pressure anti-node, breakup of the liquid Jet is affected by acoustics only if it is assisted by the coaxial gas flow. Effects on the liquid core are mainly due to the unsteady modulation of the annular gas flow induced by the acoustic waves when the mean dynamic pressure of the gas flow is lower than the acoustic pressure amplitude. At a velocity anti-node, local nonlinear radiation pressure effects lead to the flattening of the jet into a liquid sheet. A new criterion, based on an acoustic radiation Bond number, is proposed to predict jet flattening. Once the sheet is formed, it is rapidly atomized by three main phenomena: intrinsic sheet instabilities, Faraday instability and membrane breakup. Globally, this process promotes atomization. The spray is also spatially organized under these conditions: large liquid Clusters and droplets with a low ejection velocity can be brought back to the velocity anti-node plane, under the action of the resulting radiation force. These results suggest that in rocket engines, because of the large number of injectors, a spatial redistribution of the spray could occur and lead to inhomogeneous combustion producing high-frequency combustion instabilities.

AB Liquid-propellant rocket engines are widely used all over the world, thanks to their high performances, in particular high thrust-to-weight ratio. The present paper presents a general panorama of liquid propulsion as a contribution of the IAF Advanced Propulsion Prospective Group.
   After a brief history of its past development in the different parts of the world, the current status of liquid propulsion, the Currently observed trends, the possible areas Of future improvement and a Summarized road map Of future developments are presented. The road map includes a Summary of the liquid propulsion status presented in the "Year in review 2007" of Aerospace America.
   Although liquid propulsion is often seen as a mature technology with few areas of potential improvement, the requirements of an active commercial market and a renewed interest for space exploration has led to the development of a family of new engines, with more design margins, simpler to use and to produce associated with a wide variety of thrust and life requirements.

AB One of the most important developers of liquid propellant rocket engines in Argentina was Polish-born Ricardo Dyrgalla. Dyrgalla immigrated to Argentina from the United Kingdom in 1946, where he had been Studying German weapons development at the end of the Second World War. A trained pilot and aeronautical engineer, lie understood the intricacies of rocket propulsion and was eager to find practical applications to his recently gained knowledge.
   Dyrgalla arrived in Argentina during Juan Peron's first presidency, a time when technicians from all over Europe were being recruited to work in various projects for the recently created Argentine Air Force.
   Shortly after immigrating, Dyrgalla proposed to develop an advanced air-launched weapon, the Tabano, based oil it rocket engine of his design, the AN-1. After a successful development program, the Tabano was tested between 1949 and 195 1; however, the project was canceled by the government shortly after. Today, the AN-1 rocket engine is recognized as the first liquid propellant rocket to be developed in South America. Besides the AN-1, Dyrgalla also developed several other rockets systems ill Argentina, including the PROSON, a solid-propellant rocket launcher developed by the Argentine Institute of Science and Technology for the Armed Forces (CITEFA). In the late 1960s, Dyrgalla and his family relocated to Brazil due mostly to the lack of continuation of rocket development in Argentina. There, he worked for the Institute of Aerospace Technology (ITA) until his untimely death in 1970. Ricardo Dyrgalla deserves to be recognized among the world's rocket pioneers and his contribution to the science and engineering of rocketry deserves a special place in the history of South America's rocketry and space Right advocacy programs.

AB This paper presents results from an investigation of unsteady combustion inside a small-scale, multi-injector liquid rocket engine. A time-accurate approach in an axisymmetric geometry is employed to capture the unsteady flow features, as well as the unsteady heat transfer to the walls of the combustion chamber. Both thermally perfect gas (TPG) and real gas (RG) formulations are evaluated for this LOX-GH(2) system. The Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state (EoS) is used to account for real gas effects associated with the injection of oxygen. Realistic transport properties are computed but simplified chemistry is used in order to achieve a reasonable turnaround time. Results show the importance of the unsteady dynamics of the flow, especially the interaction between the different injectors. The RG EoS, despite a limited zone of influence, is shown to govern the overall chamber behavior. The sensitivity of the results to changes in the system parameters is studied and some general trends are discussed. Although several features of the simulations agree well with past experimental observations, prediction of heat flux using a simplified flux boundary condition is not completely satisfactory. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed in the context of the current axisymmetric approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The coupled numerical simulation of flow field, solid temperature field, species concentration field and gas radiation transfer/energy field based on statistical narrow-band correlated-k (SNBCK) model, is employed to accurately predict aerothermodynamic characteristic of aircraft exhaust system. A series of methods to increase computational efficiency and descend computational resources make it possible to finish the calculation in PC. The parameters of narrow-band model are evaluated by HITEMP line-by-line database. Three examples have proved the accuracy of using these methods to solve flow heat transfer coupled problem and radiation transfer/energy equation, which are the calculation of temperature distribution of water-cooling nozzle in rocket engine, the calculation of carbon dioxide absorptivity at 4.3 micron band, and the gas radiation heat transfer evaluation of the cylindrical furnace. Finally, the inner flaps temperature distribution of ejecting nozzle with floating outer flaps is computed, under high-attitude, high-speed and afterburning conditions. Two completely different air-inlet schemes of ejecting channel almost achieve the same effect in cooling inner flaps.

AB The knowledge of the flow behavior inside asymmetrically heated channels is of great importance to improve design and performance of regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The modeling of the coolant flow is a challenging task because of its particular features, such as the high wall temperature gradient, the high Reynolds number, the three-dimensional geometry of the passages, and the possible supercritical conditions of the fluid. In the present work, a numerical approach to study the turbulent How of supercritical fluids is presented and validated by comparison with experimental data. Solutions of the supercritical nitrogen flowfield in an asymmetrically heated three-dimensional channel with a high-aspect ratio (channel height-to-width ratio) are presented and discussed. Emphasis is given to the analysis of the peculiar behavior and cooling performance of the supercritical fluid as compared with perfect gas. In particular, a long channel is considered, such that entrance effects are negligible, to analyze in detail wall heat-flux evolution throughout the channel.

AB The nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein RBCC protein interacting with protein kinase C1 (RBCK1) possesses transcriptional and ubiquitin ligase activities. We have recently reported that RBCC protein interacting with protein kinase C2 (RBCK2), a RING-in-between-RING fingers domain-lacking splice variant of RBCK1, lacks transcriptional activity, but rather represses the RBCK1-mediated transcriptional activity as a cytoplasmic tethering protein for RBCK1. In this study, we have found that RBCK2 overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells interacts with the polyubiquitin chain and the polyubiquitin-interacting subunit S5a, and significantly increases the intracellular amount of polyubiquitinated proteins. These results strongly suggested that RBCK2 functions as an adaptor protein for the polyubiquitinated protein and the S5a subunit in 26S proteasome through its novel zinc finger motif and ubiquitin-like domain, respectively, presumably delivering the polyubiquitinated proteins to the entrance of the 26S proteasome catalytic domain for degradation.

AB Based on the piezoelectric effect, a new type of piezoelectric thrust vector-measuring system for a rocket engine is designed, which is made up of four three-component piezoelectric force sensors, so that 12 output force signals can be generated. Using the theoretical mechanics, the reverse formulas for the thrust vector (namely, the misalignment angle and the offset) are deduced. In order to calibrate the measuring system, a special calibration platform is designed. The calibration results show that the non-linearity and cross talk of the designed piezoelectric thrust vector-measuring system are less than 1 and 5%, respectively. Finally, a practical loading experiment is performed to test the application performance of the thrust vector-measuring system, and the experimental results prove that the thrust vector-measuring system can accurately measure both the magnitude and the direction of the thrust vector.

AB In the present research, we experimentally verified the partial-fill effect in a multicycle pulse detonation rocket engine. The intermittent thrust of a pulse detonation rocket engine was measured by using a spring-damper mechanism that smoothed this intermittent thrust in the time direction. The intermittent mass flow rates were assessed by gas cylinder pressure or mass difference measurement. The maximum specific impulse was 305 +/- 9 s at an ethylene and oxygen propellant fill fraction of 0.130 +/- 0.004. When the fill fraction was greater than 0.130, the specific impulse was increased as the partial-fill fraction was decreased. When the fill fraction was less than 0.130, the specific impulse was sharply decreased as the partial-fill fraction was decreased. This decrease was due to diffusion between propellant and purge gases and the short length of the transition from deflagration to detonation. The multicycle pulse detonation rocket engine had a partial-fill effect that may have been mainly due to the suctioned air and was consistent with the single-cycle partial-fill model of Endo et al.

   Environment
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes a new, flexible, and accurate method for predicting the vibroacoustic environment, which is a driving load case in the development of panel-mounted spacecraft units. This method accounts for the physical parameters that intervene in the dynamically coupled response of units and panels to the impingement of the sound radiated by the rocket engines. Accordingly, it can simplify the costly overdevelopment imposed by testing standards relying on simple mass formulas and significant safety factors. It quickly, provides acceleration and force levels for vibration tests, can be applied during any project phase, and allows for the coupling of models with different levels of maturity, while still avoiding the lengthy processing imposed by finite and boundary element tools. It uses impedance/mobility for dynamically condensing panels and units in a compact and modular way. The acoustic load experienced by a panel is characterized by means of physical reasoning based on acoustic diffraction and joint acceptance between the mode shapes and diffuse field. Predicted levels are presented for an actual spacecraft panel coupled with several units, and are compared to detailed vibroacoustic analysis using finite and boundary element methods, test results, and ESA and NASA standards.

TI Development of the RFBB "Bargouzine" concept for Ariane-5 evolution
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the study of a concept of Ariane-5 evolution by means of replacement of two solid-propellant boosters EAP with two liquid-propellant reusable fly-back boosters (RFBBs) called "Bargouzine". The main design feature of the reference RFBB is LOX/LH2 propellant, the canard aerodynamic Configuration with delta wings and rocket engines derived from Vulcain-2 identical to that of the central core except for the nozzle length. After separation RFBBs return back by use of air breathing engines mounted in the aft part and then landing on a runway.
   The aim of the study is a more detailed investigation of critical technology issues concerning reliability, re-usability and maintenance requirements. The study was performed in three main phases: system trade-off, technical consolidation, and programmatic synthesis. The system trade-off includes comparative analysis of two systems with three and four engines on each RFBB and determination of the necessary thrust level taking into account thrust reservation for emergency Situations. Besides, this phase contains trade-off on booster aerodynamic Configurations and abort scenario analysis.
   The second phase includes studying of controllability during the ascent phase and separation, thermo-mechanical design, development of ground interfaces and attachment means, and turbojets engine analysis taking into account reusability. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A technique for computationally determining the thermophysical properties of high-energy-density matter (HEDM) propellants is presented. HEDM compounds are of interest in the liquid rocket engine industry due to their high density and high energy content relative to existing industry-standard propellants. In order to accurately model rocket engine performance, cost and weight in a conceptual design environment, several thermodynamic and physical properties are required over a range of temperatures and pressures. The approach presented here combines quantum mechanical and molecular dynamic (MD) Calculations and group additivity methods. A method for improving the force field model coefficients used in the MD is included. This approach is used to determine thermophysical properties for two HEDM compounds of interest: quadricyclane and 2-azido-N,N-dimethylethanamine (DMAZ). The modified force field approach provides results that more accurately match experimental data than the unmodified approach. Launch vehicle and Lunar lander case studies are presented to quantify the system level impact of employing quadricyclane and DMAZ rather than industry standard propellants. In both cases, the use of HEDM propellants provides reductions in vehicle mass compared to industry standard propellants. The results demonstrate that HEDM propellants can be an attractive technology for future launch vehicle and Lunar lander applications. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE Hybrid rocket engine; Solid fuel; Surface regression rate
AB The present effort is towards predicting with some accuracy hybrid rocket engine fuel regression rates under standard flow conditions. A convective heat feedback modelling approach is applied in tying the mass-flux-dependent heat flux directed into the regressing fuel surface, to the subsequent solid fuel grain regression rate. Factors such as transpiration, hydraulic port diameter, and effective fuel surface roughness are incorporated into the phenomenological surface regression rate model. A number of comparisons between the model's predicted results and corresponding experimental data are made, in illustrating the efficacy of the present approach for a classical head-end-injection engine. Where substantial differences between theory and experiment exist, this might be due to one of several identifiable factors related to non-standard flow, such as the presence of radiant heating, swirl or flow impingement in or at the boundaries of the experimental core flow.

TI VIRTUAL PROTOTYPING OF A LANDER FOR THE FAST TRANSFER OF HUMANS TO MARS
SO JBIS-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH INTERPLANETARY SOCIETY

DT Article
DE Virtual; prototyping; humans; mars; landing; aeroshell
AB This paper uses virtual prototyping as a technique to elucidate the challenging problem of landing humans on Mars. If no countermeasures are taken during the transit from Earth the capability of humans to perform effectively on the surface of Mars will be seriously compromised. Microgravity will cause atrophy of load bearing bones and muscles weakening the crew. New treatments and technologies together with a fast transfer to Mars could help mitigate these effects. A consequence of using fast interplanetary trajectories, however, is the high arrival speed at Mars and if aerocapture is used, high mechanical and heat loads on the lander. The high decelerations could be non-survivable for weakened crewmembers. It is therefore highly desirable to use a vehicle aeroshell that can reduce the g levels to a safe level. Aeroshell options in terms of g-levels were considered using computer simulations together with other mission requirements such as sufficient living space and good payload mass efficiency. The results were then used to choose an aeroshell for the lander. Some details of the lander, such as internal layout, aerodynamic control surfaces, location of rocket engines, were then further prototyped in virtual environments.

TI Practical uses of liquid methane in rocket engine applications
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Liquid methane has been considered an attractive rocket propellant for several decades. However, most rocket engine development efforts in the last 30 years have focused on using more traditional fuels such as hydrogen, kerosene, and earth storables, without any serious development or application of methane to propulsion systems.
   This paper presents a summary of recent 8701bf thrust LOX/LCH(4) (liquid oxygen/liquid methane) engine test results and recent LOX/LCH(4) torch igniter testing. Multiple test series were conducted using both radiation cooled and ablative chamber hardware. This engine testing yielded measured minimum C* efficiencies of 97% using non-optimized engine hardware, with expectations that better than 99% efficiency can readily be achieved with minor hardware optimization. The combustion process was shown to be stable in all tests and the operating transition from poor quality methane (two-phase fluid) at startup to liquid-liquid, sub-cooled, steady state operation was demonstrated. Engine test results showed chamber wall compatibility with high propellant mixture ratios and excellent boundary layer performance of methane as a chamber film coolant. The Aerojet work on methane propulsion and energy applications is also briefly summarized. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper is concerned with the response of confined low-Reynolds-number jets to external modulations of large amplitudes. The jet formed inside a duct by an orifice plate is submitted to flow perturbations impinging on the constriction from the upstream side. Vortices are generated in the downstream region, giving rise to conversion from acoustic oscillation to convective modes. Experiments and simulations are carried out to characterize this important mode conversion process. It is shown that the convective perturbation phase is a linear function of the distance from the orifice plate and of the operating frequency. Data can be collapsed into a single curve with some scatter providing a scaling rule for the phase. Numerical simulations are carried out and a method is developed to decompose the local velocity perturbations into acoustic and convective components. This is used to determine the amplitudes of upstream and downstream acoustic velocities and of the convective perturbations on the downstream side of the orifice. It is shown that the acoustic velocity approximated by a bulk oscillation in the orifice vicinity is reduced at the constriction and that this is simultaneously compensated by the generation of convective perturbations. The conversion efficiency of this process is characterized. Results obtained can be used to design How control devices; they provide insight into the generation of vortices in orifice plate systems submitted to large pressure oscillations and could be useful to the analysis of vortex instabilities in segmented solid rocket engines.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center's E-3 test facility.

TI Experiments on cavitation instability of a two-bladed turbopump inducer

DT Article
DE Turbopump; Inducer; Cavitation; Instability
AB The turbopump is a pressurizing system that supplies liquid propellants to the combustion chamber of a rocket engine at high pressure. As an integral component of a high-speed pumping system, the inducer used in a turbopump is forward-attached to an impeller to improve suction performance. This paper describes an experimental investigation on the flow instabilities of a two-bladed axial inducer due to cavitation. Cavitation development and its instabilities were analyzed. Asymmetric cavitation and cavitation surge were observed, and characterized by measuring the inlet pressure fluctuation for various cavitation numbers and flow coefficients. As flow coefficient decreases, the increased intensity of asymmetric cavitation was observed with an increased inception number of asymmetric cavitation. The frequency of the detected cavitation surge in the 4-10Hz range varied depending on the cavitation number. The instantaneous transition to cavitation surge appeared at the end of asymmetric cavitation as the cavitation number decreased. However, a further decrease in cavitation number resulted in the stable operation of the inducer with low values of pressure fluctuation. Finally, an intensive cavitation surge appeared after a significant amount of head loss.

TI Simulation of Combustion Instabilities in Liquid Rocket Engines with

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID FINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEMES; FLOW; GAS
AB The authors present a new method for predicting combustion instabilities in liquid rocket engines. This method is based on the solution of the linearized governing equations for a three-dimensional combustor geometry in the time domain. The aim of this paper is to show the general feasibility of the approach and to explain the general behavior of the model. The computational domain comprises the combustion chamber itself and the convergent part of the nozzle. The heat release is included via a source term in the linearized energy equation. In the example of the European Aestus engine, it is shown that the model is able to predict the different oscillation modes without any preliminary assumptions about them. An analysis of the influence of the nozzle illustrates that its behavior is automatically included in the approach by design. In comparison to the solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations, the method has the advantage of a much lower numerical cost.

AB Turbopumps which pressurize fuels and oxidizers are generally used to operate liquid rocket engine for space launch vehicles. It is considered very important to predict fatigue properties at elevated temperatures for the design and manufacturing of reliable turbopump systems. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is one of the most promising manufacturing methods for gas turbine rotors. In this research, five kinds of Ni-based superalloys (Inconel 718 HIP, Inconel 718 HIP and heat treated, MAR-M-247 HIP. MAR-M-247 HIP and heat treated and Rene 95 HIP) were investigated at elevated temperatures. Original universal slopes method, modified universal slopes method, Mitchell's method, Baumel and Seeger's method, and Ong's method have been used for predicting the high temperature low-cycle fatigue performance. Among these methods, Mitchell's method showed the best adaptation results for the life prediction of Ni-based HIP superalloys. A novel equation was suggested by modification of Mitchell's method to predict Ni-based HIP superalloys at elevated temperature more accurately. The equation predicted well the low-cycle fatigue of HIP superalloys as well as of cast Rene 80 at elevated temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RADIATIVE HEAT-TRANSFER
AB Investigation of the infrared characteristics of a rocket nozzle is very important for the study of infrared initiating technology. The Narrow-Band Zone model is developed for that purpose. The spectral transmission and absorption factors are introduced, and the equations between radiative heat flux and the temperature of wall surfaces and gas are developed. The radiative heat transfer in one axisymmetric cylindrical enclosure filled with homogeneous radiative participating medium is computed with the Narrow-Band Zone model and compared with those in the reference documents. The comparison shows good agreement. The radiative heat transfer to the nozzle of one rocket engine is also calculated with the Narrow-Band Zone model, and the outgoing radiative energy flux and energy rate integrated in a mid-wave infrared band 2 similar to 6 mu m, a long-wave infrared band 8 similar to 14 mu m and the full wave band are analyzed. The following conclusions can be derived: the spectral radiation from the inlet and outlet of the nozzle show apparent spectral discontinuity, which appears greater in the 2.7 similar to 2.95 mu m than in the neighboring wave band. The spectral outgoing radiative energy flux of nozzle wall is similar to that of gray body, which decreases with wavelength in 2 similar to 14 mu m. The outgoing radiative energy flux on the nozzle wall is greater in the cylindrical and contracting section of nozzle, but smaller in the divergent section, which is determined by temperature. The nozzle of the rocket engine radiates most energy in the mid-wave surfaces by absorption. The most important feature of gas radiation is the strong selection of the waveband, so the detailed study of the infrared characteristics of nozzle of the rocket engine should be carried out on narrow-band computation.

AB This paper describes the experimental strategy developed to improve the modeling of liquid-vapor flows during the chill down of rocket engines by cryogenic fluid in microgravity. A similarity analysis is performed to determine the relevant dimensionless numbers for the design of an experiment similar to engine flows. A literature review on reduced gravity quenching experiments, and on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer shows the lack of validated models for microgravity. Experimental results obtained with the quenching of a glass tube by FC72 during parabolic flight are presented. Especially the impact of gravity and subcooling on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer is investigated. Results show an increase in rewetting temperature, and a decrease in film boiling heat transfer under reduced gravity in agreement with the literature. The comparison of 0 g flow pattern with corresponding tests on ground points out a behavior at 0 g closest to 1 g upflow than 1 g downflow.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Computational and experimental studies on a forward-sweep inducer for Liquid Rocket Engine (LRE) turbopumps were conducted to evaluate the effects of forward-sweep of the leading edge on the performance of an inducer in comparison with a conventional backward-sweep inducer. Computational results show that backflows at the inlet decrease in the case of the forward-sweep inducer by inhibiting pre-rotation of the inflow and the low pressure region at backflow also diminishes, which is presumed to improve the suction performance of the inducer. Experimental results show that the suction performance of the forward-sweep inducer is almost the same as that of the backward-sweep inducer although it has a smaller inlet tip diameter and shorter axial length. The efficiency of the forward-type inducer is found better than that of the backward-sweep inducer due to the small size of backflows. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Creep feed grinding is widely used in manufacturing supperalloy materials. These materials are usually used in aircrafts, gas turbines, rocket engines, petrochemical equipments and other high temperature applications. The objective of this paper is to model and predict the grinding forces of the creep feed grinding of these materials using the neural network. This model is then used to select the working conditions (such as depth of cut, the wheel speed and workpiece speeds) to prevent the surface burning and to maximize the material removal rate. The results show that the combined neural network and an optimization system are capable of generating optimal process parameters. The outcomes of the paper are now used to apply the optimal working conditions for grinding the turbine blades.

SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB High-frequency instabilities in liquid propellant rocket engines are experimentally investigated in a model scale research facility. Liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are injected in the combustion chamber at 0.9 MPa through three coaxial injectors vertically aligned. High-amplitude transverse pressure fluctuations are generated in the chamber at frequencies above 1 kHz by a rotating toothed wheel actuator which periodically blocks an auxiliary lateral nozzle. The chamber eigenmodes are identified in a first stage by examining the response of the system to a linear frequency sweep. In a second stage the chamber is excited at the frequency corresponding to the first transverse (1T) mode. The effect of the pressure mode on combustion is observed with intensified and high-speed cameras. Photo-multipliers and pressure sensors are also used to characterize the system behavior and examine phase relations between the corresponding signals. Flame structure modifications observed for specific injection conditions correspond to a strong coupling between acoustics and combustion which notably modifies the flow dynamics, augments the flame expansion rate and enhances heat transfer to the wall.

ID FLAME STABILIZATION
AB A hydrogen gas chiller was designed and fabricated in order to simulate the hydrogen temperature ramping test for liquid rocket engines in a single-element gaseous hydrogen/liquid oxygen combustion chamber. Hot fire PDPA measurements of droplet sizes and velocities as a function of the gaseous hydrogen temperature for a fixed mass flow and shear coaxial injector configuration were obtained as the hydrogen temperature was varied from 130 to 290 K, resulting in a doubling of the hydrogen/oxygen velocity and momentum flux ratios. Measured droplet Sauter and arithmetic mean diameters decreased as the hydrogen temperature increased. However, even though the hydrogen temperature change resulted in a doubling of the velocity and momentum flux ratios, the droplet Sauter mean diameter only decreased by 12.5%. These results indicate that the increase in droplet size as the injected hydrogen temperature is decreased may not be a significant contributor to the resulting combustion instability for liquid rocket engines operating at the conditions examined in this study.

TI Numerical Investigation on Multi-cycle Operation of Pulse Detonation

LA English
DT Article
AB In order to investigate the multi-cycle operation process of pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE), estimate the propulsion performance and obtain the regulation of the control parameters for performance optimization, a one-dimensional unsteady performance analysis model of PDRE is established and a CFD code is developed. The AUSM scheme and the third-order TVD Runge-Kutta method are used for spatial and temporal discretization, respectively. Chemical kinetics is modelled by a one-progress-variable scheme. The stiffness is dealt with by using the Strang-splitting method and fully implicit method. Through the simulation of the PDRE utilizing stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen as the detonative mixture and nitrogen as purge gas, it can be found that the flow field in the detonation tube is much more complicated in multi-cycle operation due to the coupling of each cycle, compared with in single-cycle operation. The effects of the duty cycle of the filling period on flow characteristics and propulsion performance are also investigated here. As the duty cycle of the filling period decreases, the average thrust reduces too, but all filled mixture based specific impulse and detonative mixture based specific impulse increase. However, if the duty cycle of filling is too small, the gas temperature at the exit of PDRE will significantly increase. The results suggest that appropriately reducing the valve duty cycle of filling to decrease detonative mixture filling length can improve the propulsion performance and make PDRE run in an economical way.

The rocket thrust optimal control is investigated with the use of Pontryagin maximum principle. It is shown, that accounting for real peculiarities of the regulation characteristic of considered engine system allows one to draw a conclusion on insignificance of decrease in efficiency under replacement of the variable thrust engine by much more simple rocket engine with constant in magnitude thrust.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Understanding the cooling efficiency of supercritical hydrogen is crucial to the development of high-pressure thrust chambers for regeneratively cooled liquid-oxygen/liquid-hydrogen rocket engines. Available Nusselt number correlations are compared with an extensive data set of local heat transfer coefficients to determine the domains of validity for each correlation. The data set was compiled from previous heated straight-tube experiments with supercritical hydrogen. Results indicate that particular correlations perform better than others for certain regimes of fluid properties, with the accuracy of heat transfer coefficient predictions ranging from +/- 23 to over +/- 100%. Correlation uncertainty due to inherent uncertainties in the equation-of-state and transport properties of supercritical hydrogen is also evaluated. The property dependent uncertainty was found to range from 2 to 10%, and therefore is not the main contributor to the larger errors in the correlation predictions. A number of published correlations for nonhydrogen supercritical fluids are shown to achieve comparable performance with hydrogen.

For both stages, four 745,000 lbf thrust, RS-68 oxygen/hydrogen rocket engines, presently used on the Delta-IV launch vehicle, are used. The booster, which does not require reentry thermal protection, ascends to a Mach 2.4,81,000 ft altitude condition, separates from the core stage, and glides back to a runway landing. Sixty-five metric tons in orbit would be enabling to a variety of exploration missions, including very large telescope emplacement missions, robust outer planet missions, and others requiring large payload masses or volumes. Use of a reusable booster, designed for maintainability and affordability, would, in combination with an expendable core using common propulsion, allow for significant reductions in recurring costs compared with a totally expendable vehicle with similar payload capabilities.

AB To suppress the cavitation in the impellers and to make the turbo-pump lives longer, the inducer was separated from the main impeller and both impellers were driven independently. The performance of the pump and the flow conditions around the impellers were investigated experimentally and the following results were obtained. (1)The main impeller contributes to the flow interaction between the inducer and the main impeller. (2)The rotational speeds of both impellers can be controlled independently in order to suppress simultaneously the cavitation not only in the main impeller, but also in the inducer.

AB In this paper, the theory based on multi-sensor information fusion is studied, which is used to evaluate the health condition of liquid-propellant rocket engine ground-testing bed. The concept of health degree is defined. It is used as a quantitative index for evaluating the health condition of the ground-testing bed. In order to evaluate the health condition of the ground-testing bed on different levels, health degrees of a single parameter, of a sub-system and of a system are defined. They accordingly measure the health conditions of single parameter, sub-system and system of the ground-testing bed. The method of fuzzy data fusion is used to calculate the health degree. In this method the weight of each monitoring sensor is calculated by analytic hierarchy process (AHP), then, the multi-sensor data are fused by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, next, the sequence data are fused by two-grade index evaluation method, finally, the health degree is calculated by defuzzification method. Based on these, the health condition evaluation system of ground-testing bed is set up, which can evaluate the health condition of the ground-testing bed properly and quantitatively. At last, the application of the health evaluation system in fault detection and health evaluation of the ground-testing bed are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hypersonics technology development has faced many obstacles, not all of them technical. But interest in the field has increased following successful ground tests of the new NASA/DARPA/Air Force X-51A engine. Officials say the program's short-term purpose is only to prove the practically of hypersonic scramjet propulsion. But they also note that this is an essential first step toward development of a high-speed, long-range missile and, ultimately, of an operationally responsive hypersonic space launch vehicle.

TI Flow choking by drag and combustion in supersonic engine-testing
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Breakdown of diffuser flow in the engine wind tunnel has often been observed during scramjet engine tests conducted in the Ramjet Engine Test Facility in Japan. The unstable and precipitant nature of the breakdown phenomena may result in serious damage to the engine wind tunnel and should therefore be prevented. A one-dimensional analysis was applied to the diffuser flow to identify the causes of the How breakdown. All the losses and gains by the engine were represented by point sources of mass, momentum, and energy. The duct friction term was integrated along the diffuser, assuming that the normal shock was located at the exit of the duct. The thermal choking condition was calculated by incorporating results of a chemical equilibrium numerical code. The fuel rates causing the flow choking were successfully reproduced and matched with the limit of fuel rates observed in our tests. Inlet unstart of the engine caused the loss of the ejector-pumping effect in the diffuser system, which triggered flow choking. Choking was also promoted by the drag of the gas sampling rakes. The choking in diffuser flow and the engine unstart may be coupled, resulting in hysteresis in the diffuser breakdown, which was also experienced in our tests. As the rocket-based, combined-cycle engine is scheduled to be tested under the Mach 4 condition in 2007, the safety of the experiment is now a primary issue. The current analysis showed that the new engine would easily cause choking of diffuser because of the larger propellant supply rates and the relatively low specific impulse. Reasonable operation of the wind tunnel to control the flow choking in future tests was examined.

AB An archival paper is presented on the development and production by the Reaction Motors Division of Thiokol Chemical Corporation of the LR44-RM-4, LR58-RM-4, and LR62-RM-2 packaged liquid rocket engines. These factory-filled units were the only significant use by the United States of liquid propellant technology for airborne tactical missiles. The LR58 and LR62 were in worldwide use by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force in the 1960s and 1970s, with some 50,000 having been produced. Total program costs in 1965 dollars were $120 million. These robust units were used without restrictions on flight-carrying cycles, catapult launchings, or carrier landings, with a recorded functional reliability of the LR58 at 90% confidence level of 0.9978. Commencing with early work in 1957 a review is made of the sequential programs and the technical and operational hurdles overcome in such novel designs. Brief insights are provided into the events that prevented further development of the family.

AB Future launchers will use rocket propulsion systems burning CH4/LO2 at high chamber pressure, and so it is useful to analyze the thermophysical properties of these species and their combustion products at these conditions. High-pressure (real-gas) effects significantly modify combustion regimes, for instance, the propellants Re injected near the critical temperature, and so to simulate mixing and combustion processes in subtranscritical regimes highpressure effects must be described. This paper analyzes the compressibility factors of CH4, O-2, CO2, and H2O at a pressure of 15 MPa and calculates the difference between ideal- and real-gas thermophysical properties for these species in the range of temperature in which experimental data are available. Finally, the paper describes thermophysical properties at typical liquid rocket engine combustion chamber conditions (100 < T < 6000 K, 15 MPa) by polynomial fits. As there are no experimental data at high temperatures, theories are necessary to predict properties at temperatures different from the experimental ones: thus, low-temperature experimental data (National Institute of Standards and Technology tables) are used in conjunction with predictions obtained with the Lee-Kesler equation of state (for density and isobaric specific heat) and with the Chung et al. method (for viscosity and thermal conductivity). This paper will try to clarify the impact of subtrans-supercritical parameters on mixing and combustion in future liquid rocket engines.

AB NiCrAlY top coats are currently being considered as environmental protective coatings for copper alloy liners in rocket engine combustion chambers of reusable launch vehicles. The microstructure and mechanical properties of this top coat sprayed on GRCop-84 have been characterized as a function of thermal cycling between 298 and 873 K and no obvious degradation was observed. Interfacial microsample tensile tests developed to measure coating adhesion to the substrate revealed that the interfaces were stronger than the substrate in both the as-received and thermal cycled conditions. Finite element modeling was used to analyze the stresses in the microsamples and verify the strength of the interfaces. The formation of depleted zones, devoid of Cr2Nb particles, was associated with plasma arc cleaning in a minority of the samples prepared for this study, and the presence of these depleted zones has been found to significantly decrease the adhesion of the NiCrAlY coating and to change the failure mode in thermal cycled specimens.

AB Gas generator is the device to produce high enthalpy gases needed to drive turbo-pump system in liquid rocket engine. And, the combustion temperature in gas generator should be controlled below around 1,000K to avoid any possible thermal damages to turbine blade by using either fuel rich combustion or oxidizer rich combustion. Thus, nonequilibrium chemical reaction dominates in fuel-rich combustion of gas generator. Meanwhile, kerosene is a compounded fuel with various types of hydrocarbon elements and difficult to model the chemical kinetics. This study focuses on the prediction of the non-equilibrium reaction of fuel rich kerosene/LOX combustion with detailed kinetics developed by Dagaut using PSR (Perfectly Stirred Reactor) assumption. In Dagaut's surrogate model for kerosene, chemical kinetics of kerosene consists of 1,592 reaction steps with 207 chemical species. Also, droplet evaporation time is taken into account in the PSR calculation by changing the residence time of droplet in the gas generator. Frenklach's soot model was implemented along with detailed kinetics to calculate the gas properties of fuel rich combustion efflux. The results could provide very reliable and accurate numbers in the prediction of combustion gas temperature, species fraction and material properties.

AB The KRAB domain is a 75 amino acid transcriptional repression module that is encoded by more than 400 zinc finger protein genes, making it the most abundant repression domain in the human proteome. KRAB-mediated gene silencing requires a direct high affinity interaction with the RBCC domain of KAP-1 co-repressor. The structures of the free KRAB domain or the KRAB-RBCC complex are unknown. To address this, we have performed a systematic biophysical analysis of all KRAB isoforms using purified recombinant proteins. All KRAB domains are predominantly monomeric either alone or in a complex with KAP-1-RBCC protein, while a KRAB-SCAN isoform. exists as a stable dimer. The KRAB:KAP-1-RBCC interaction requires only the A box in the context of the KRAB(Ab) or KRAB(AC) but both A and B boxes in the context of KRAB(AB). All isoforms, bind the KAP-1-RBCC in a stable, zinc dependent fashion with a stoichiometry of KRAB1:3 RBCC with a zinc content of four atoms per RBCC monomer. Limited proteolysis, mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analyses suggest that a core complex comprises the entire RBCC domain of KAP-1 and the AB box of the KRAB domain rendering it resistant to proteolysis. NMR spectroscopy showed that unbound KRAB domain does not exist as a well-folded globular protein in solution but may fold into an ordered structure upon binding to the KAP-1-RBCC protein. This is the first example of a structurally disordered repressor domain that is the most widely conserved silencing domain in tetrapods. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB GRCop-84 is a copper-chromium-niobium alloy developed for liquid rocket engine combustion chamber liners. GRCop-84 exhibits superior properties over conventional copper-based alloys in a liquid hydrogen-oxygen operating environment. A program to demonstrate scale-up production capabilities of GRCop-84 to levels suitable for main combustion chamber production for the prototype rocket engine was undertaken. This paper describes a novel method of manufacturing the main combustion chamber liner. The process consists of several steps: extrude the GRCop-84 powder into billets, roll the billets into plates, bump form the plates into cylinder halves, and friction stir weld the halves into a cylinder. The cylinder is then metal spun formed to near net liner dimensions, followed by finish machining to the final configuration. This paper describes the friction stir weld process development, including tooling and nondestructive inspection techniques, culminating in the successful production of a liner preform completed through spin forming.

AB This paper will describe the history, technology and design features of the XP spaceplane being developed by Rocketplane Ltd. in Oklahoma. The XP is a four seat fighter-sized spaceplane that uses turbojets for takeoff and landing and a liquid oxygen/kerosene rocket engine for main propulsion during its ascent to a 100km apogee suborbital space flight.
   The XP is intended to serve a variety of markets including suborbital tourist flights, intermediate duration microgravity research, remote sensing, astronomy, and microsatellite launch missions. Changes in vehicle configuration and flight profile for serving each of these markets will be described.
   The prototype XP will have its rollout ceremony at the end of 2007 and will begin test flights in early 2008. Commercial space flight operations are expected to begin in fall 2008 with tourist flights and microgravity research flights being the early customer base.
   The spaceplane's flight systems, safety systems, and operating procedures will be reviewed. In addition, key elements of the Rocketplane business and financial model will be discussed. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Fiber optic Raman sensor to monitor the concentration ratio of nitrogen

SO APPLIED OPTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A spontaneous Raman scattering optical fiber sensor was developed for a specific need of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for long-term detection and monitoring of the purity of liquid oxygen (LO2) in the oxidizer feed line during ground testing of rocket engines. The Raman peak intensity ratios for liquid nitrogen (LN2) and LO2 with varied weight ratios (LN2/LO2) were analyzed for their applicability to impurity sensing. The study of the sensor performance with different excitation light sources has helped to design a miniaturized, cost-effective system for this application. The optimal system response time of this miniaturized sensor for LN2/LO2 measurement was found to be in the range of a few seconds. It will need to be further reduced to the millisecond range for real-time, quantitative monitoring of the quality of cryogenic fluids in a harsh envioronment. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB The B-box type 2 domain is a prominent feature of a large and growing family of RING, B-box, coiled-coil (RBCC) domain-containing proteins and is also present in more than 1500 additional proteins. Most proteins usually contain a single B-box2 domain, although some proteins contain tandem domains consisting of both type I and type 2 B-boxes, which actually share little sequence similarity. Recently, we determined the solution structure of B-box1 from MID1, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in X-finked o Opitz G/BBB syndrome, and showed that it adopted a beta beta alpha RING-like fold. Here, we report the tertiary structure of the B-box2 (CHC(D/C)C2H2) domain from MIDI using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. This MIDI B-box2 domain consists of a short alpha-helix and a structured loop with two short anti-parallel beta-strands and adopts a tertiary structure similar to the B-box1 and RING structures, even though there is minimal primary sequence similarity between these domains. By mutagenesis, ESI-FTICF, and ICP mass spectrometry, we show that the B-box2 domain coordinates two zinc atoms with a 'cross-brace' pattern: one by Cys175, His178, Cys195 and Cys198 and the other by Cys187, Asp190, His204, and His207. Interestingly, this is the first case that an aspartic acid is involved in zinc atom coordination in a zinc-finger domain, although aspartic acid has been shown to coordinate non-catalytic zinc in matrix metalloproteinases. In addition, the finding of a Cys195Phe substitution identified in a patient with X-linked Opitz GBB13 syndrome supports the importance of proper zinc coordination for the function of the MID1 B-box2 domain. Notably, however, our structure differs from the only other published B-box2 structure, that from XNF7, which was shown to coordinate one zinc atom. Finally, the similarity in tertiary structures of the B-box2, B-box1 and RING domains suggests these domains have evolved from a common ancestor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of several overlay coatings on Cu-8 at. %Cr4%Nb alloy (GRCop-84) thermally cycled in a high heat flux hydrogen-oxygen combustion flame are reported. Finite element analyses (FEA) were conducted to evaluate the expected performances of coatings with different thermal conductivities as well as to determine a suitable thickness for coating deposition. Top coats consisting of Cu-26%Cr, NiAl and NiCrAlY along with a Cu-8%Cr bond coat were vacuum plasma sprayed on GRCop-84 thin sheet specimens. It was observed that the Cu-26%Cr coating formed blisters whereas the NiAl and NiCrAlY coatings showed no significant differences between the exposed and unexposed specimens. Water-cooled rectangular specimens specially designed to simulate a rocket engine liner were coated with a NiCrAlY-top coat using either a Cu-8%Cr or a Cu-8%Cr-1%Al bond coat. Preliminary tests conducted on these specimens showed no visible evidence of coating spallation after 40 cycles. The measured temperatures and heat fluxes were used in FEA models to estimate the stresses, strains and temperatures across the coating interfaces in these specimens. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The main task of this paper is to compare two types of low thrust rocket engines: constant thrust vs. variable-thrust engines. We will be concerned with efficiency, where efficiency is evaluated in the case of the orbit-to-orbit transfer with maximum payload mass in the central Newtonian gravity field. The launch mass of the space vehicle is supposed to be fixed. The traditional solution is the decomposition of the problem into parametric and dynamical parts. The corresponding variational problems differ for two rocket thruster types under consideration. We propose change of variables, which makes it possible to reduce averaged equations of optimal motion of a spacecraft with the mentioned engines to the unified form. Using this unified form comparison of the performance of constant- and variable-thrust engines is conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All Rights reserved.

ID MISSILE
AB The thrust vector control (TVC) of rocket engines is used when the aerodynamic surfaces are inadequate to control vehicles or when a greater agility may be required of a missile. Traditionally, in all spacecraft to date actuators used to gimbal the engine have been hydraulic. The subject of this paper is the TVC with gimballed nozzle assembly controlled by an electrohydraulic servosystem, where two linear hydraulic servoactuators gimbal the engine. Each servoactuator is controlled by an electrohydraulic servovalve. The thrust vector direction is a result of the motion of both servoactuators. In this paper the TVC system is treated as a robotic system that allows developing the procedure of solving an inverse kinematics problem as well as the control of the robotic system in the output space instead of in the space of internal dynamics. The position feedback is provided by measuring the direction of the thrust vector, instead of measuring the displacements of the servoactuators. A linear model of the servosystem has been developed and simulated. The proposed control concept has experimentally been validated in the TVC test bench. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The issues relevant to propulsion design for Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) vehicles are considered. In particular two air-breathing engine concepts involving precooling are compared; SABRE (Synergetic Air-Breathing and Rocket Engine) as designed for the Skylon SSTO launch vehicle, and a LACE (Liquid Air Cycle Engine) considered in the 1960's by the Americans for an early generation spaceplane. It is shown that through entropy minimisation the SABRE has made substantial gains in performance over the traditional LACE precooled engine concept, and has shown itself as the basis of a viable means of realising a SSTO vehicle. Further, it is demonstrated that the precooler is a major source of thermodynamic irreversibility within the engine cycle and that further reduction in entropy can be realised by increasing the heat transfer coefficient on the air side of the precooler. If this were to be achieved, it would improve the payload mass delivered to orbit by the Skylon launch vehicle by between 5 and 10%.

TI Heat flux measurements for a GO(2)/GH(2) single-element, shear injector
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB A new, high-pressure facility was used to investigate GO(2)/GH(2) single-element, shear, coaxial injectors with operating conditions typical of rocket engines. Oxygen-to-hydrogen mass flow ratios of 4 and 6 at operational chamber pressures of 6.2, 4.9, 4.5, and 2.8 MPa were investigated by 1) keeping the propellant mass flow rates constant while changing the exhaust nozzle diameter, and 2) by keeping the exhaust nozzle diameter constant and changing the propellant mass flow rates to change the chamber pressure. Axial heat fluxes, injector face temperature, and exit nozzle temperature were measured. The injector's outer diameter was 2.7 mm and the chamber cross section was square with a side L = 2.5 cm. Maximum heat release occurred at 2.4 L from the injector face. The injector face temperatures showed little to no dependence on chamber pressure except for high mass flow ratios. A clear dependence exists, however, on the chamber length. The profiles of heat flux and chamber wall temperatures indicated no pressure dependence and only a slight dependence on propellant injection velocities when the mass flows were kept constant. A scaling of heat flux values based on fuel mass flow rate, instead of chamber pressure, is, therefore, suggested. The lack of pressure dependence and only slight dependence on the propellant injection velocities suggested that the basic dynamic structures of the combusting flow were mainly dominated by the chamber geometry.

AB A series of heat-insulating and ablating simulation tests were carried out using oxyacetylene flame to simulate the rocket engine exhaust flame, which was aiming at seeking for solution to the overheating and erosion- and ablation-induced failure of small scientific supersonic craft actuator caused by the engine exhaust flame. Thus the flowing fields of the rocket engine exhaust flame were analyzed by means of numerical simulation. The effectiveness of various organic resin coatings and ceramic coating in preventing the ablation of the actuator was investigated based on the simulation tests. rocket engine bench test, and field trial launch test. The temperature changes of the inner wall of the coated actuator during the field launch test were monitored using a data remote-sensing system and compared to that by numerical calculation. It was found that the flowing fields of the rocket engine exhaust flame could be readily analyzed using the numerical simulation method. The phenolic resin and silicone coatings had excellent ability to prevent the actuator from overheating and ablation. Specifically, the silicone coating of a thickness about 0.5 rum was able to keep the temperature on the inner wall of the actuator during the field launch test below 70 degrees C and hence could be suggested as the first choice to acquire satisfactory ablation and erosion protection of the actuator.

TI The adenovirus E4 ORF3 protein binds and reorganizes the TRIM family

AB One of the most interesting functions attributed to the adenovirus early region 4 open reading frame 3 (E4 ORF3) protein is its reorganization of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein nuclear bodies. These normally punctate structures are reorganized by E4 ORF3 into tracks that eventually surround viral replication centers. PML rearrangement is an evolutionarily conserved function of E4 ORF3, yet its cause and functional relevance remain mysteries. The E4 ORF3 protein coimmunoprecipitates with the PML protein, yet E4 ORF3 still forms tracks in cells that lack PML. The PML protein is a member of a larger protein family termed tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins. TRIM proteins contain a tripartite domain structure in proximity to their N termini that consists of a RING finger domain, followed by one or two B box domains and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (collectively termed the RBCC domain). The order and spacing of these domains are evolutionarily conserved and thought to mediate protein-protein interactions and other functions. We implemented a proteomic approach to isolate cellular proteins that bind to E4 ORF3. We identified a novel interaction between E4 ORF3 and another TRIM family member, transcriptional intermediary factor 1 alpha (TIF1 alpha). TIF1 alpha functions by recruiting coactivators and/or corepressors to modulate transcription. The interaction between E4 ORF3 and TIF1 alpha was validated by coimmunoprecipitation and binding of recombinant proteins. Indirect immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that TIF1 alpha is reorganized into track structures that contain PML upon E4 ORF3 expression. The RBCC domain of TIF1 alpha is sufficient for E4 ORF3-induced rearrangement, and TIF1 alpha reorganization is conserved across adenovirus serotypes.

AB The E3 ubiquitin ligase neuregulin receptor degrading protein 1 (Nrdp1) mediates the ligand-independent degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor family member ErbB3/HER3. By regulating cellular levels of ErbB3, Nrdp1 influences ErbB3-mediated signaling, which is essential for normal vertebrate development. Nrdp1 belongs to the tripartite or RBCC (RING, B-box, coiled-coil) family of ubiquitin ligases in which the RING domain is responsible for ubiquitin ligation and a variable C-terminal region mediates substrate recognition. We report here the 1.95 angstrom crystal structure of the\ C-terminal domain of Nrdp1 and show that this domain is sufficient to mediate ErbB3 binding. Furthermore, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to map regions of the Nrdp1 surface that are important for interacting with ErbB3 and mediating its degradation in transfected cells. The ErbB3-binding site localizes to a region of Nrdp1 that is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, in contrast to ErbB3, which is only found in vertebrates. This observation suggests that Nrdp1 uses a common binding site to recognize its targets in different species.

DE flows in nozzles
ID FLOWS; MODEL
AB The plug nozzle is one of the advanced expansion devices proposed to improve the overall performance of launcher liquid rocket engines. The present work investigates the three-dimensional flow field generated on this kind of nozzle by partitioning the primary nozzle into modules. A linear plug nozzle has been designed together with modules having two different geometries: a rectangular cross section and round-to-square module. Numerical simulations have been carried out considering the case where all modules of the primary nozzle are active and the case where one module is turned off. The solutions are compared and specific three-dimensional flow structures taking place inside the modules and on the plug are identified. The relationship between these structures and the skin friction distribution within the module and along the plug surface is investigated. Finally, the effect on performance of these three-dimensional flow features is emphasized. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS
AB An optimization approach, based on computational fluid dynamics methodology, is investigated for the performance prediction and optimization of liquid rocket engine nozzle. The CFD code employs implicit Lower-Upper decomposition (LU) scheme for solving the two-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and species transport equations in an efficient manner. The validity of the code is demonstrated by comparing the numerical calculations with both the experimental data and previous calculations. Then the code, called by three optimization algorithms (i.e. successive quadratic programming method, genetic algorithm and interdigitation strategy) respectively, is used to design axisymmetric Optimum-thrust nozzle. Results show that improvement on nozzle thrust can be obtained over that of the baseline case. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Numerical parametric analysis of dual-bell nozzle flows
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Dual-bell nozzles permit two different operating modes, which provide higher performance than conventional bell nozzles when applied to rocket engines operating from sea level. During the low-altitude mode, the flow is separated and the separation line is located near the inflection of the nozzle wall, in a region characterized by a negative value of the wall pressure gradient, as in conventional nozzles, and in which side loads may occur. The characteristics of this region in hot full-scale applications are addressed by means of numerical simulations, and scaling laws are sought for cold subscale side-load experiments. Moreover, the flow behavior during the transition between the two operating modes is analyzed by time-accurate simulations.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Operating conditions of a rocket-ramjet combined-cycle engine for a single-stage-to-orbit aerospace plane were studied. The engine was composed of an ejector-jet mode, a ramjet mode, a scramjet mode, and a rocket mode. Characteristics of the engine operating conditions were studied analytically. The thrust augmentation effect of the ejector-jet mode was found to be small at low subsonic speed and to increase with an increase of the flight Mach number. Study of the effective impulse function clarified that higher specific impulse was preferable in supersonic flight, whereas greater thrust coefficient was preferable in hypersonic flight. The mentioned characteristics were examined by simulation of engine operating in an aerospace plane flight. Transportation of a mass into orbit was compared among several engines with different combinations of thrust and specific impulse. The mass which could be carried into orbit was larger with a ramjet mode of higher specific impulse and with a scramjet mode of greater thrust.

AB This paper compares the performance of the scramjet-powered stages of two different launch systems: one using a hydrogen-fueled scramjet stage and one using a hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet stage. The two launch systems are optimized with respect to payload delivery capability and then compared, assuming a fixed launch mass. A rocket-powered booster is used to achieve the required scramjet ignition conditions, and a rocket-powered orbital stage is used to accelerate the payload from scramjet shutdown to low Earth orbit. The trajectory simulator includes a full spheroidal, rotating Earth model, a fourth-order gravitation model, and an MSISE93 atm model. A gradient projection optimization routine is used to achieve an optimal solution using a set of time-referenced vertical accelerations as optimization parameters. Hypersonic engine performance is determined using a quasi-one-dimensional scramjet model. Results show that a hydrogen-powered scramjet launch system outperforms a hydrocarbon-powered system, due to its higher specific impulse and peak Mach number. Although payload mass fractions are shown to be favorable, the high structural requirements of the scramjet imply that reusability is a key characteristic to make them financially viable. Trajectories were found to be dominated by their lift requirements, which outweighed any performance advantage for hydrocarbon fuels in terms of their better storage capability.

AB Compressible turbulent flows are an important element of high-speed flight. Boundary layers developing along fuselage and wings of an aircraft and along engine compressor and turbine blades are compressible and mostly turbulent. The high-speed flow around rockets and through rocket nozzles involves compressible turbulence and flow separation. Turbulent mixing and combustion in scramjet engines is another example where compressibility dominates the flow physics. Although compressible turbulent flows have attracted researchers since the fifties of the last century, they are not completely understood. Especially interactions between compressible turbulence and combustion lead to challenging, yet unsolved problems. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) represent modern powerful research tools which allow to mimic such flows in great detail and to analyze underlying physical mechanisms, even those which cannot be accessed by the experiment.
   The present lecture provides a short description of these tools and some of their numerical characteristics. It then describes DNS and LES results of fully-developed channel and pipe flow and highlights effects of compressibility on the turbulence structure. The analysis of pressure fluctuations in such flows with isothermal cooled walls leads to the conclusion that the pressure-strain correlation tensor decreases in the wall layer and that the turbulence anisotropy increases, since the mean density falls off relative to the incompressible flow case. Similar increases in turbulence anisotropy due to compressibility are observed in inert and reacting temporal mixing layers. The nature of the pressure fluctuations is however two-facetted. While inert compressible mixing layers reveal wave-propagation effects in the pressure and density fluctuations, compressible reacting mixing layers seem to generate pressure fluctuations that. are controlled by the time-rate of change of heat release and mean density variation as sources in the pressure Poisson equation rather than wave propagation phenomena. This opens new challenges to turbulence modellers and underlines the need to treat compressibility effects via the full Reynolds stress equations. (c) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Weinheim.

AB The bidirectional vortex refers to the bipolar, coaxial swirling motion that can be triggered, for example, in cyclone separators and some liquid rocket engines with tangential aft-end injectors. In this study, we present an exact solution to describe the corresponding bulk motion in spherical coordinates. To do so, we examine both linear and nonlinear solutions of the momentum and vorticity transport equations in spherical coordinates. The assumption will be that of steady, incompressible, inviscid, rotational, and axisymmetric flow. We further relate the vorticity to some power of the stream function. At the outset, three possible types of similarity solutions are shown to fulfill the momentum equation. While the first type is incapable of satisfying the conditions for the bidirectional vortex, it can be used to accommodate other physical settings such as Hill's vortex. This case is illustrated in the context of inviscid flow over a sphere. The second leads to a closed-form analytical expression that satisfies the boundary conditions for the bidirectional vortex in a straight cylinder. The third type is more general and provides multiple solutions. The spherical bidirectional vortex is derived using separation of variables and the method of variation of parameters. The three-pronged analysis presented here increases our repertoire of general mean flow solutions that rarely appear in spherical geometry. It is hoped that these special forms will permit extending the current approach to other complex fluid motions that are easier to capture using spherical coordinates.

AB A numerical analysis was carried out in order to investigate the combustion and heat transfer characteristics in a liquid rocket engine in terms of non-gray thermal radiation and soot formation. Governing gas and droplet phase equations with PSIC model, turbulent combustion model with liquid kerosene fuel, soot formation, and non-gray thermal radiative equations are introduced. A radiation model was implemented in a compressible flow solver in order to investigate the effects of thermal radiation. The finite-volume method (FVM) was employed to solve the radiative transfer equation, and the weighted-sum-of-gray-gases model (WSGGM) was applied to model the radiation effect by a mixture of non-gray gases and gray soot particulates. After confirming the two-phase combustion behavior with soot distribution, the effects of the O/F ratio, wall temperature, and wall emissivity on the wall heat flux were investigated. It was found that the effects of soot formation and radiation are significant; as the O/F ratio increases, the wall temperature decreases. In addition, as the wall emissivity increases, the radiative heat flux on the wall increases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SIMULATION
AB The cavitation behavior of a four-blade rocket engine turbopump inducer is simulated. A two-dimensional numerical model of unsteady cavitation was applied to a blade cascade drawn from an inducer geometry. The physical model is based on a homogeneous approach of cavitation, coupled with a barotropic state law for the liquid/vapor mixture. The numerical resolution uses a pressure-correction method derived from the SIMPLE algorithm and a finite volume discretization. Unsteady behavior of sheet cavities attached to the blade suction side depends on the flow rate and cavitation number Two different unstable configurations of cavitation are identified. The mechanisms that are responsible for these unstable behaviors are discussed, and the stress fluctuations induced on the blade by cavitation instabilities are estimated.

AB The near injector combustion zone has been investigated in a coaxially injected liquid rocket engine (LRE) thrust chamber at steady state, high-pressure conditions. Liquid oxygen (LOx) and hydrogen (H-2) are injected via various coaxial injector elements providing a range of representative LRE operating conditions in terms of non-dimensional values. Propellant flow rates are regulated at constant R-OF to achieve combustion pressures below, near and above the thermodynamic critical point of oxygen.
   Optical accessibility is achieved via quartz glass windows which enables the application of high temporal resolution optical diagnostics. Spontaneous OH chemiluminescence presents an indication of the combustion zone whilst shadowgraph imaging provides a visual representation of the core and coaxial flow field.
   Results from an extensive test series highlight that reduced pressure (P-r) has a significant influence on propellant flow field evolution and the entire combustion process in a LRE thrust chamber. Strong qualitative trends previously observed at elevated pressure are further validated through detailed analysis of measurement data and the application of various image-processing techniques. The influence of reduced pressure is quantified based on LOx-spray evolution, assessment of flame emission intensity measurements and the efficiency and roughness of combustion.

AB Coaxial injection is a very common system in industrial burners or rocket engines. Theoretical studies involving different hypotheses have been devoted to this subject. Experimental studies have been performed in several individual configurations. Subsequently, many correlations are proposed in the literature. All these expressions do not take into account the same basic quantities, which may be troublesome for injector designers. In the present work, we have performed experiments in a system where both geometry and liquid characteristics could be varied over a wide range. Changes in atomization regimes, liquid core length, and spray angle are especially examined in the present paper. They were estimated using fast shadowgraphy. We show that the momentum flux ratio plays a key role in all these quantities in the dense core zone. Gas flow Reynolds number is also important for disintegration mode classification. Empirical correlations show that liquid's physical properties (viscosity or surface tension) have little influence on the atomization process in the range studied. The Rayleigh instability growth rate model, based on the existence of a shear layer at the interface, seems to be the most suitable in predicting the dense core zone properties, showing that primary atomization in coaxial injectors is essentially ruled by aerodynamic effects.

AB Coaxial injectors find many applications in industrial burners or rocket engines. Scaling these devices is therefore an important challenge for burner designers. Theoretical scaling relations for spray properties have been proposed by several authors. Systematic experimental study of gaseous flow properties is already available in the literature. We have found it useful to perform a systematic experimental study of liquid physical properties and injector dimensions, which are typical scaling parameters for applications. The experimental setup used in the present work enables nine different geometrical configurations and a set of various liquid mixtures. Averaged droplets' size and velocities were measured using phase Doppler anemometry. Our experimental results confirm the scaling rules based on the capillary instability theory for the primary atomization zone. Different results are found for the two main atomization regimes: fiber and superpulsating modes. The characteristics of the spray produced it? the fiber mode are strongly linked to primary atomization. The superpulsating mode provides a better quality spray, in terms of averaged droplets diameter, but is more dependent on secondary atomization phenomena. Finally, correlations involving momentum flux ratio, Weber number, gaseous flow Reynolds number, and diameter ratio are proposed. They complete the correlations of the literature involving liquid and gaseous flow densities.

AB In a liquid rocket engine, acoustic damping induced by gas-liquid scheme injectors is studied experimentally for combustion stability by adopting linear acoustic test. In the previous work, it has been found that gas-liquid scheme injector can play a significant role in acoustic damping or absorption when it is tuned finely. Based on this finding, acoustic-damping characteristics of multi-injectors are intensively investigated. From the experimental data, it is found that acoustic oscillations are almost damped out by multi-injectors when they have the tuning length proposed in the previous study. The length corresponds to a half wavelength of the first longitudinal overtone mode traveling inside the injector with the acoustic frequency intended for damping in the chamber. But, new injector-coupled acoustic modes show up in the chamber with the injectors of the tuning length although the target mode is nearly damped out. And, appreciable frequency shift is always observed except for the case of the worst tuned injector. Accordingly, it is proposed that the tuning length is adjusted to have the shorter length than a half wavelength when these phenomena are considered.

AB Anecdotal examples that illustrate the contributions that basic studies have made to aircraft and rocket ignition and combustion behavior are recalled. Some almost forgotten experimental supersonic combustion studies done in the 1950s by a small group at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory are recalled and described. Those studies anticipated the hypersonic, nearly Mach 10, flight that was achieved 50-some years later by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration aircraft in November 2004. A suggestion for further work related to combustion in the scramjet aircraft is made. Consideration of the use of hydrocarbon fuel spiked,with a pyrophoric ignition and combustion enhancer, rather than hydrogen, is suggested.

AB Combustion stability boundaries are investigated experimentally using a subscale chamber for screening the split-triplet impinging jet injectors of a liquid propellant rocket engine. Geometrical dimensions and operating conditions of the subscale chamber are determined using the scaling methods proposed in the previous works. From the experimental tests, two major instability regions are identified by the parameters of combustion-chamber pressure and mixture (oxidizer/fuel) ratio. A key instability mechanism can be explained by the correlation between the characteristic burning or mixing time and the characteristic acoustic time. In each instability region, the dynamic behavior of the flame is investigated to verify the characteristic lengths of the jet injectors derived from hydrodynamic-theory. It is found that pressure oscillations with large amplitude are generated by lifted-off flames. Stability margins are evaluated as a function of the impingement angle and thereby, the optimum angle is identified.

AB The performance of a conceptual, missile-class, hypersonic vehicle was modeled using a 2-degree-of-freedom dynamics model. The vehicle was assumed to be air launched, accelerated to a Mach number of 3 using a solid propellant rocket, and subsequently propelled using a dual-mode scramjet engine to cruise at Mach numbers between 4 and 9. Modeling results show that fuel storage capacity and dynamic pressure have a significant effect on vehicle range and average speed. A perturbation analysis was also performed that ranked the sensitivity of missile range to small changes in 14 design parameters. The kinetic energy efficiency (total pressure loss) of the scramjet has the highest effect on performance at high cruise Mach numbers (6.7-9), followed by structural mass, combustion efficiency, and aerodynamics parameters. At low cruise Mach numbers (4-6.7), structural concerns dominate performance, followed by the aerodynamics and scramjet operating parameters.

AB Numerical study of coupled heat transfer of gas flow with film cooling, chamber wall conduction, and regeneration coolant cooling in the thrust chamber of a liquid rocket engine was performed. A one-dimensional model was adopted for regeneration cooling to couple two-dimensional model simulation in the thrust camber. Numerical results show that the method adopted can simulate the gas flow field well, and can calculate the heat flux through the wall, the wall temperature, and the temperature increase of the coolant quickly. In addition, liquid film cooling can reduce the wall temperature greatly, and decrease the heat flux transferred from the hot gas to the chamber wall.

AB Liquid rocket engines for launch vehicles and space crafts as well as their subsystems need to be verified and qualified during hot-runs. A high test cadence combined with a flexible test team helps to reduce the cost for test verification during development/qualification as well as during acceptance testing for production. Test facility intelligence allows to test subsystems in the same manner as during complete engine system tests and will therefore reduce development time and cost.
   This paper gives an overview of the maturing of test engineering know how for rocket engine test stands as well as high altitude test stands for small propulsion thrusters at EADS-ST in Ottobrunn and Lampoldshausen and is split into two parts:
   Part 1 gives a historical overview of the EADS-ST test stands at Ottobrunn and Lampoldshausen since the beginning of Rocket propulsion activities in the 1960s.
   Part 2 gives an overview of the actual test capabilities and the test engineering know-how for test stand construction/adaptation and their use during running programs.
   Examples of actual realised facility concepts are given to demonstrate cost saving potential for test programs in both cases for development/qualification issues as well as for production purposes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The characteristics of propellant mixing near the injector have a profound effect on liquid rocket engine performance. Injector element geometry and propellant momentum are the only parameters available to control such mixing. A multiphase flow combustion model utilizing propellant real-fluid properties was developed to predict the mixing and thermal environment created by element configurations. The multiphase model was incorporated into a mature computational fluid dynamics code that can be used, to simulate the flowfield near the injector and to analyze the combustion chamber and nozzle, wall heating. The validity of the present model and code was investigated by comparing predictions to test data for two liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen unielement shear coaxial injector and two cryogenic nitrogen jet injection experiments. These simulations and those of several other investigators were critically compared at the 2nd International Workshop on Rocket Combustion Modeling. Based on these comparisons, it appears that the present model is a good, computationally efficient approximation of liquid rocket injector flows for both subcritical and supercritical spray combustion.

AB The paper explores the feasibility of using ballistic hopper vehicles with CO2/metal rocket engines instead of rovers in Mars missions. The hopper mission scenario involves several ballistic flights and hence visiting several sites on Mars surface. The Martian CO2 is acquired before every takeoff; the liquid CO2 is used directly as oxidiser for powdered magnesium fuel transported from Earth. The mission analysis takes into account the power and time required for CO2 acquisition. The mathematical simulation shows possibilities to fulfil the exploration programme typically assigned for a rover. It is also shown that the CO2/metal propulsion promises much longer hops as compared with engines using conventional bipropellant transported from Earth. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the frame of National Program "Acrospatial" The National Institute of Turbomachinery-COMOTI, Bucharest, Romania proposes a project of launching with minimum cost of microsatellites using the national territory. The geographical position of Romania is optimum for satellites launching due to the presence of the Black Sea in the eastern part of the country and due to its elongated shape, West-East, offering a launching surface of 1500 km (W-E) x 250 km (N-S). Two modes of launching were analyzed: vertical, from the soil and horizontal, from a carrier aircraft. The second mode of launching doubtless has some advantages, particularly from the point of view of costs. It was analyzed the launching of a LEO satellite as a payload of a 'single stage rocket with solid propellant, launched from a fighter aircraft. The aerodynamic coefficients of the rocket, the equation of movement on the trajectory and the rocket engine thrust were calculated using a FORTRAN program-LSCS (language for the simulation the continuous systems). The shape of the trajectory was imposed (not optimized), finally resulting the performances, the main geometrical dimensions of the rocket and the mass of the satellite. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

LA English
DT Article
DE launch vehicle design; air-breathing vehicle sizing; trajectory design
   sizing program; launch vehicle performance
AB The overall sizing of launch vehicles is of interest, especially when air-breathing is also included. The sizing of a launch vehicle is dictated by the State of Art technologies present and the need to match the challenging demands of high-payload fraction, low cost, and also ensure reliability. This paper presents some of the important design requirements. An ideal velocity approach, which assumes various velocity losses, is generally followed for initial vehicle sizing. However, as this approach is approximate and sometimes incorrect, a new concept of accounting the drag and thrust losses during the atmospheric phase for conventional rockets and air-breathing launch vehicles using scramjet propulsion is evolved complementing the ideal velocity sizing approach. A simplistic two-dimensional trajectory simulation program with graphics for quick interactive design was developed for this purpose. The air-breathing launch vehicle trajectory is split into three flight phases. The sizing of the vehicle considering, especially, the intermediate air-breathing regime is also dealt with. A method to determine the maximum-load envelope expressed in terms of the product of flight dynamic pressure and angle of attack, namely Q-alpha, for all weather launches useful for initial design purposes is also suggested. The design program meant for initial design sizing purposes gives a quick insight on the vehicle performance prior to detailed design with minimum basic vehicle data for conventional rockets and also for air-breathing scramjet vehicles. The various design factors, such as optimum velocity requirement for two stage to orbit vehicles and the sizing requirement of the orbital stage after end of air-breathing phase, are also discussed through representative typical values highlighting the design sensitivities.

TI German rocket engineers in Britain - Their influence revisited
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The technical aspects of the arrival and work of the German rocket engineers or scientists (referred to as engineers from now on) who came to Britain after World War 2 have been covered in a previous work [J. Becklake, German engineers: their contribution to British rocket technology after World War 11, AAS History Series 22 (1998) 157-172; in: P. Jung (Ed.), 27th History Symposium of the IAA, Graz, Austria, October, 1993]. This paper considers the origins and work of these Germans while in Germany, where they were employed in Britain, their interaction with British colleagues both at work and at play and finally looks at their overall influence on British rocket technology. The final destinations of the British Germans will be covered. Although many stayed for only a short time before moving on to, e.g. the USA or back to Germany, a number stayed in England for the rest of their lives and their descendants are still there.

AB Recent studies have revealed the contribution of TRIM alpha to retrovirus restriction in cells from a variety of primate species. TRIM5 alpha consists of a tripartite motif (the RBCC domain) followed by a B30.2 domain. The B30.2 domain is thought to be involved in determination of restriction specificity and contains three variable regions. To investigate the relationship between the phylogeny of primate TRIM5 alpha and retrovirus restriction specificity, a series of chimeric TRIM5 alpha consisting of the human RBCC domain followed by the B30.2 domain from various primates was constructed. These constructs showed restriction profiles largely consistent with the origin of the B30.2 domain. Restriction specificity was further investigated with a variety of TRIM5 alpha s containing mixed or mutated B30.2 domains. This study revealed the importance of all three variable regions for determining restriction specificity. Based on the molecular structures of other PRYSPRY domains solved recently, a model for the molecular structure of the B30.2 domain of TRIM5 alpha was developed. The model revealed that the variable regions of the B30.2 domain are present as loops located on one side of the B30.2 core structure. It is hypothesized that these three loops form a binding surface for virus and that evolutionary changes in any one of the loops can alter restriction specificity.

ID CERAMIC COMPOSITES; FABRICATION; CARBON
AB A two-dimensional model was developed according to infiltration-induced structural changes in C/SiC composites and physicochemical phenomena involved in isothermal chemical vapour infiltration (ICVI) process. The mathematical model was implemented to simulate the densification behaviour of the C/SiC component of a small-scale thruster liner for rocket engine. The calculated results show that infiltration efficiency is high at first and then decreases dramatically, which is in agreement with the corresponding experimental results. The correspondence between calculated results and experimental data implied that this mathematical model is reasonable and feasible for characterizing the densification behaviour of C/SiC composites in the ICVI process. The dependence of densification behaviour of C/SiC composites on infiltration temperature has also been investigated. Calculation results show that the densification rate increases while density uniformity of overall composites decreases evidently with elevated temperature.

AB A two-dimensional axisymmetric viscous flow analysis of a rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engine inlet is performed using a time-marching numerical scheme to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The flow configuration is a subscale model of the engine inlet which was previously tested in the 1X1 supersonic wind tunnel at NASA Glenn Research Center. The computed results are compared with the experimental data which include static pressure profiles along the centerbody and the cowl surface of the inlet. The computational results show a reasonably good agreement with the experimental data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For the quantitative measurement in an optically dense spray, the intensity of the attenuated signal should be corrected. Therefore, the optical line patternator was applied to get the original distribution of the dense spray injected from a swirl injector at high ambient pressure up to 4.0 MPa. The optical line patternator is a combined technique of laser extinction measurement and image processing for the spray characterization. The spray was scanned with the laser beam and the line image of Mie scattering was captured simultaneously in the path of each laser beam by using a CCD camera. A photo-diode was used to obtain the transmission data that was the amount of the incident laser beam passing through the spray region. The distribution of the attenuation coefficients in the spray was obtained by processing the transmission data and Mie-scattering distribution data by an algebraic reconstruction technique. From the distribution of attenuation coefficients, we can obtain the accurate surface distribution from the Mie-scattering signal. Because the optical line patternator uses a laser beam instead of a laser sheet to scan the spray, the effect of multiple scattering, due to the increased number density of droplets in a high pressure environment is reduced significantly. The optical line patternator is suitable for investigating the characteristics of a relatively large spray under high pressure environments such as liquid rocket engines.

AB The effect of vacuum heat treatment on the microstructure and microhardness of the cold-sprayed Cu-4 at.%Cr-2 at.%Nb alloy was investigated. After heat treatment, a Cr2Nb phase formed in the gas-atomized powder was uniformly distributed in the matrix. Minimal grain growth of the Cr2Nb phase was observed accompanying the healing-up of the incomplete interfaces between the deposited particles at the elevated treatment temperatures. The microstructure and microhardness of the annealed cold-sprayed Cu-4 at.%Cr-2 at.%Nb alloy were comparable with those of the deposits fabricated by vacuum plasma spraying, which makes it a promising material for regeneratively cooled rocket engine applications.

AB Aerojet used the patented thrust augmented nozzle (TAN) concept to validate a unique means of increasing sea-level thrust in a liquid rocket booster engine. We have used knowledge gained from hypersonic Scramjet research to inject propellants into the supersonic region of the rocket engine nozzle to significantly increase sea-level thrust without significantly impacting specific impulse. The TAN concept overcomes conventional engine limitations by injecting propellants and combusting in an annular region in the divergent section of the nozzle. This injection of propellants at moderate pressures. allows for obtaining high thrust at takeoff without overexpansion thrust losses. The main chamber is operated at a constant pressure while maintaining a constant head rise and flow rate of the main propellant pumps. Recent hot-fire tests have validated the design approach and thrust augmentation ratios. Calculations of nozzle performance and wall pressures were made using computational fluid dynamics analyses with and without thrust augmentation flow, resulting in good agreement between calculated and measured quantities including augmentation thrust. This paper describes the TAN concept, the test setup, test results, and calculation results. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ret finger protein(RFP) is a member of the tripartite motif family, which is characterized by a conserved RING finger of motif, a B-box, and a coiled-coil domain(they are called RBCC generally). Although RFP was known to be an oncogene when its RBCC moiety was connected with a tyrosine kinase domain by DNA rearrangement, its biological function was not well defined. In this study, by using real-time RT-PCR, the RFP expressions in human and mouse normal tissues, and in the cervical squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and brain cancer tissues were analyzed. The re suit of the study proved that the highest level of mRNA reverse transcription appeared in the normal testical tissue, whereas that in other normal tissues of human and mice were low. The mRNA reverse transcription level of RFP was higher in the endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue than in the cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissue; the mRNA reverse transcription level of RFP in the gastric adenocarcinoma tissue was significantly higher than that in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissue. It was also found that the mRNA reverse transcription level of RFP in the brain cancer tissue was higher than that in the normal brain tissue. These results suggested that RFP could possibly be a useful molecular target for the development of new therapeutics for malignant tumors.

TI Multi-element unstructured analyses of complex valve systems
SO JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB The safe and reliable operation of high-pressure test stands for rocket engine and component testing places an increased emphasis on the performance of control valves and flow metering devices. In this paper we will present a series of high-fidelity computational analyses of systems ranging from cryogenic control valves and pressure regulator systems to cavitating venturis that are used to support rocket engine and component testing at NASA Stennis Space Center. A generalized multi-element framework with sub-models for grid adaption, grid movement, and multi-phase flow dynamics has been used to carry out the simulations. Such a framework provides the flexibility of resolving the structural and functional complexities that are typically associated with valve-based high-pressure feed systems and have been difficult to deal with using traditional computational fluid dynamics methods. Our simulations revealed a rich variety of flow phenomena such as secondary flow patterns, hydrodynamic instabilities, fluctuating vapor pockets, etc. In the paper we will discuss performance losses related to cryogenic control valves and provide insight into the physics of the dominant multi-phase fluid transport phenomena that are responsible for the "choking-like" behavior in cryogenic control elements. Additionally, we will provide detailed analyses of the modal instability that is observed in the operation of a pressure regulator valve. Such instabilities are usually not localized and manifest themselves as a system-wide phenomena leading to an undesirable chatter at high flow conditions.

AB An active diagnostic system using built-in piezoelectric actuator/sensor networks was developed for monitoring crack growth in a rocket engine pipe. The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A(0) mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S-0 mode in plates) to crack growth.

TI High-frequency transverse acoustic coupling in a multiple-injector
   cryogenic combustor
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID ROCKET ENGINE; DYNAMICS; JET; CHALLENGES; PROGRESS; FLAMES
AB High-frequency combustion oscillations are investigated experimentally. The combustor fed by cryogenic propellants operates under elevated pressure conditions (p(c) = 0.9 MPa) and is equipped with three coaxial injectors fed by liquid oxygen and gaseous methane. Injection parameters are in the typical range used in rocket engines. This experiment simulates on a model scale conditions prevailing in such systems, but full similarity is not achieved. The chamber exhibits a set of resonant modes with eigenfrequencies above 1 kHz. The study focuses on high-frequency dynamics resulting from a strong coupling between one of the transverse modes and combustion. The combustor is forced with an external actuator. The eigenmodes are identified with a linear frequency sweep, and then the system is modulated at the first transverse resonant frequency. The flame motion and response are observed with a high speed and two intensified charge-coupled-device cameras recording phase-conditioned images. In a set of experiments carried out on the multiple-injector combustor, operating conditions were changed systematically to determine parameter ranges leading to combustion sensitivity to transverse excitation. Strong coupling is observed in this way with a spectacular modification of the flame spread. Emission from the three flames is notably intensified when this coupling occurs, whereas thermocouples placed on the lateral walls detect a rapid increase in temperature. The OH* emission intensity that can be linked to the heat-release rate is increased. A phase analysis indicates that the pressure and OH* emission oscillate transversally and in phase at the modulation frequency. This behavior is also observed with the high-speed camera, which also features enhanced reactive vortices convected in the downstream direction at a lower frequency.

DE combustion stability; stability boundary; hot-fire test; model chamber;
   triplet impinging-jet injectors
AB Combustion stability characteristics in actual full-scale combustion chamber of a rocket engine are investigated by experimental tests with the model (sub-scale) chamber. The present hot-fire tests adopt the combustion chamber with three configurations of triplet impinging-jet injectors such as F-O-O-F, F-O-F, and O-F-O configurations. Combustion stability boundaries are obtained and presented by the parameters of combustion-chamber pressure and mixture (oxidizer/fuel) ratio. From the experimental tests, two instability regions are observed and the pressure oscillations have the similar patterns irrespective of injector configuration. But, the O-F-O injector configuration shows broader upper-instability region than the other configurations. To verify the instability mechanism for the lower and upper instability regions, air-purge acoustic test is conducted and the photograph of the flames is taken. As a result, it is found that the pressure oscillations in the two regions can be characterized by the first impinging point of hydraulic jets and pre-blowout combustion, respectively.

DE combustion stability; rocket combustor; injector; acoustic test;
   acoustic damping
ID INSTABILITIES
AB In a liquid rocket engine, the role of gas-liquid scheme injector as an acoustic resonator or absorber is studied experimentally for combustion stability by adopting linear acoustic test. The acoustic-pressure signals or responses from the chamber are monitored by acoustic amplitude. Acoustic behavior in a rocket combustor with a single injector is investigated and the acoustic-damping effect of the injector is evaluated for cold condition by the quantitative parameter of damping factor as a function of injector length. From the experimental data, it is found that the injector can play a significant role in acoustic damping when it is tuned finely. The optimum tuning-length of the injector to maximize the damping capacity is near half of a full wavelength of the first longitudinal overtone mode traveling in the injector with the acoustic frequency intended for damping in the chamber. When the injector has large diameter, the phenomenon of the mode split is observed near the optimum injector length and thereby, the acoustic-damping effect of the tuned injectors can be degraded.

AB This paper describes the development and flight testing ora new air-launch method for safely launching personnel and cargo into low Earth orbit (LEO). A new rocket is also being designed that will be,carried by and launched using the new air-launch method from a modified 747 airliner. This new air-launch method, called trapeze-lanyard air drop (t/LAD) launch, will greatly improve simplicity, safety, cost, and reliability of launching personnel into LEO. A t/LAD launch eliminates the need for wings or fins on the launch vehicle; greatly reduces ascent,dynamic pressure, sideways accelerations and bending forces, and rocket engine thrust vectoring control; and allows the use of a simple and very safe vapor pressurization (Vapak) engine cycle for the launch vehicle. This paper reports on the flight-test results of dropping three,23%-scale drop test articles using,the t/LAD launch method.

TI Linear stability analysis of the effects of camber and blade thickness
   on cavitation instabilities in inducers
SO JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB It has been shown by experimental and numerical studies that various cavitation instabilities occur in inducers for rocket engines when the cavity length exceeds about 65% of the blade spacing. On the other hand, it has been pointed out by an experimental study that the cavitation instabilities occur when the pressure gradient near the throat becomes small to some degree. The present study is motivated to examine the latter criterion based on pressure gradient for cavitation instabilities from the viewpoint of theoretical analysis. For this purpose, analyses of steady flow and its stability were carried out for cavitating flow in cascades with circular arc and plano-convex blades by a singularity method based on closed cavity model. It was found that the criterion based on the cavity length for the occurrence of cavitation instabilities is more adequate than the criterion based on the pressure gradient. It was also found that the steady cavity length and the stability of the flow in bot cascades can be practically correlated with a parameter sigma [2(alpha- alpha(o))], where sigma is a cavitation number, alpha is an angle of attack, and an is a shockless angle of attack.

TI Effects of orifice internal flow on breakup characteristics of

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPINGING JETS; LIQUID JETS; ATOMIZATION; SPRAYS
AB Under cold-flow and atmospheric ambient pressure conditions, the breakup characteristics of liquid sheets formed by a like-doublet injector were investigated. The sheet breakup wavelength, which induces the sheet to be broken into ligaments, and the sheet breakup length, which is important for finding the flame location, were measured using stroboscopic light. After sheet breakup, liquid ligaments are formed intermittently, and their wavelengths are believed to be related to the combustion instability of liquid-rocket engine. Therefore, the wavelength and the breakup length. of ligaments broken into fine drops were also measured. Because these spray characteristics are affected by the flow characteristics of the two liquid jets before they impinge on each other, the focus was on the effects of orifice internal flow, such as the cavitation phenomenon that occurs inside a sharp-edged orifice. From the experimental results, it was found that liquid jet turbulence delays sheet breakup and shortens the wavelengths of both sheets and ligaments. Because the turbulence strength of a sharp-edged orifice is stronger than that of a round-edged orifice, the shape of orifice entrance gives large differences in the spray characteristics. With these results, empirical models of the spray characteristics of a like-doublet injector were proposed, and these models can provide useful and practical data for use in designing liquid-rocket combustors.

AB A conceptual design study was performed to assess and compare the parameters of two-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch-vehicle systems in an effort to identify optimal configurations for improved access to space. The following vehicle configuration categories were considered: horizontal takeoff ramjet-scramjet boosters with upper-stage reusable rockets, horizontal takeoff turbine boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages, and vertical takeoff rocket boosters with ramjet-scramjet upper stages. Ramjet-scramjet upper stages utilize integrated rockets for final orbital ascent. Ramjet-scramjet booster stages make use of either integrated turbines or rockets for takeoff and acceleration to ramjet start. The payload requirement for each vehicle system is 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile low Earth orbit. The vehicle solutions were-evaluated utilizing several figures of merit including empty weight, wetted area, actively cooled area, gross weight, staging considerations, and design and technology traceability to future development of single-stage-to-orbit hypersonic airbreathing vehicles. The application of these criteria to the closed vehicle solutions reveals that the vertically launched rocket booster with an upper-stage ramjet-scramjet is the best two-stage airbreathing launch vehicle configuration. Of all of the two-stage vehicles investigated, those which place the hypersonic propulsion elements as part of the upper stage surpass those with first-stage placement and exhibit more design traceability with single-stage-to-orbit airbreathing launch vehicles.

TI Solution structure of the RBCC/TRIM B-box1 domain of human MlDl: B-box
   with a RING

AB B-box domains are a defining feature of the tripartite RBCC (RING, B-box, coiled-coil) or TRIM proteins, many of which are E3 ubiquitin ligases. However, little is known about the biological function of B-boxes. In some RBCC/TRIM proteins there is only a single B-box (type 2) domain, while others have both type 1 and type 2 B-box domains in tandem adjacent to their RING domain. These two types of B-boxes share little sequence similarity; except the presence of cysteine and histidine residues: eight in most B-box1 domains and seven in B-box2 domains. We report here the high-resolution solution structure of the first B-box1 domain (from the human RBCC protein, MIDI) based on 670 nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)-derived distance restraints, 12 hydrogen bonds, and 44 dihedral angles. The domain consists of a three-turn cc-helix, two short beta-strands, and three beta-turns, encompassing Val117 to Pro164, which binds two zinc atoms. One zinc atom is coordinated by cysteine residues 119, 122, 142, 145, while cysteine 134, 137 and histidine 150, 159 coordinate the other. This topology is markedly different from the only other B-box structure reported; that of a type 2 B-box from Xenopus XNF7, which binds a single zinc atom. Of note, the B-box1 structure closely resembles the folds of the RING, ZZ and U-box domains of E3 and E4 ubiquitin enzymes, raising the possibility that the B-box1 domain either has E3 activity itself or enhances the activity of RING type E3 ligases (i.e. confers E4 enzyme activity). The structure of the MIDI B-box1 also reveals two potential protein interaction surfaces. One of these is likely to provide the binding interface for Alpha 4 that is required for the localized turnover of the catalytic subunit of PP2A, the major Ser/Thr phosphatase. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In a companion liquid rocket engine development project, due to the overall weight constraint of the propulsion system, a cavitating venturi is selected to control the liquid fuel and liquid oxidizer mass flow rates. Two cavitating venturis, one for the fuel and the other for the oxidizer, are designed to deliver the desired mass flow rates for a specified operating inlet pressure, temperature, and inlet cross-sectional area. The converging and diverging angles of the venturis are selected from the literature for minimum pressure losses. An experimental setup is designed to verify that the cavitating venturis can deliver the specified flow rates. Two different techniques are used to pressurize the system: in the first method, pressurized nitrogen as is used, and in the second method, high pressure combustion gases generated from a solid propellant gas generator are used. Transient mass flow rates could not be measured using standard methods due to the short duration of the water tests; instead, average mass flow rates are calculated. The results verify that the designed cavitating venturis can indeed provide the desired mass flow rates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Trim5 alpha protein from several primates restricts retroviruses in a capsid (CA)-dependent manner. In owl monkeys, the B30.2 domain of Trim5 has been replaced by cyclophilin A (CypA) following a retrotransposition. Restriction of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) by the resulting Trim5-CypA fusion protein depends on CA binding to CypA, suggesting both that the B30.2 domain might be involved in CA binding and that the tripartite RING motif, B-BOX, and coiled coil (RBCC) motif domain can function independently of the B30.2 domain in restriction. To investigate the potential of RBCCs from other Trims to participate in restricting HIV-1, CypA was fused to the RBCC of Trim1, Trim18, and Trim19 and tested for restriction. Despite low identity within the RBCC domain, all fusion proteins were found to restrict HIV-1 but not the nonbinding G89V mutant, indicating that the overall structure of RBCC and not its primary sequence was important for the restriction function. The critical interaction between CA and Trim-CypA appears to take place soon after viral entry. Quantitative PCR analysis of viral reverse transcriptase products revealed that the different fusion proteins block HIV-1 at two distinct stages of its life cycle, either prior to reverse transcription or just before integration. With Trim1 and Trim18, this timing is dependent on the length of the Trim component of the fusion protein. These observations suggest that restriction factor binding can have different mechanistic consequences.

AB The biological significance of RBCC (N-terminal (R) under bar ING finger/ (B) under bar -box/(c) under bar oiled (c) under bar oil) proteins is increasingly being appreciated following demonstrated roles in disease pathogenesis, tumorigenesis, and retroviral protective activity. Found in all multicellular eukaryotes, RBCC proteins are involved in a vast array of intracellular functions; but as a general rule, they appear to function as part of large protein complexes and possess ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity. Those members characterized to date have diverse C-terminal domain compositions and equally diverse subcellular localizations and functions. Using a bioinformatics approach, we have identified some new RBCC proteins that help define a subfamily that shares an identical domain arrangement (MID1, MID2, TRIM9, TNL, TRIM36, and TRIFIC). Significantly, we show that all analyzed members of this subfamily associate with the microtubule cytoskeleton, suggesting that subcellular compartmentalization is determined by the unique domain architecture, which may in turn reflect basic functional similarities. We also report a new motif called the COS box, which is found within these proteins, the MURF family, and a distantly related non-RBCC microtubule-binding protein. Notably, we demonstrate that mutations in the COS box abolish microtubule binding ability, whereas its incorporation into a non-microtubule-binding RBCC protein redirects it to microtubule structures. Further bioinformatics investigation permitted subclassification of the entire human RBCC complement into nine subfamilies based on their varied C-terminal domain compositions. This classification schema may aid the understanding of the molecular function of members of each subgroup and their potential involvement in both basic cellular processes and human disease.

AB In order to evaluate the tribological properties of ball bearings used in high-speed cryo-turbopumps of liquid rocket engines, a tribometer to operate at high sliding speed in cryogenic environment is required. In order to meet the above requirements, a new high-speed cryo-tribometer has been designed. With this new tribometer, the evaluation of friction and wear mechanisms of various self-mated materials and solid lubricant coatings under high sliding speeds (> 0.5-45 m/s) with high Hertzian contact stresses (up to 2.5 GPa) in cryogenic fluid is now possible. Two additional features available with this new cryo-tribometer are: (a) a mono-ball rolling-on-disk tester under the above conditions for the analysis of rolling friction and (b) the testing of unlubricated and lubricated ball bearing (10 mm diameter bore) submerged in liquid nitrogen or liquid helium under very high-speed (36,000 rpm). An additional provision has been made for the continuous measurement of bearing frictional torque at a maximum axial load of 50N. The design details of the new tribometer are the major focus of discussion in this paper. This paper also reports the results of a very first set of experiments conducted on self-mated 440C steel and AISI 304 steel under liquid nitrogen (LN2) immersed condition with selected testing parameters. Testing of ball bearings with Pb-IP coating at 36,000 rpm under liquid nitrogen also has been carried out. Additionally, the wear mechanisms for self-mated steel in cryogenic liquid are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article deals with the application of OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) to the study of high-pressure cryogenic flames (p = 6.3 MPa). It is shown that this optical diagnostic provides good-quality data and can be used to examine the flame structure in the injector near-field. High-pressure conditions require a careful choice of excitation wavelength based on a detailed analysis of the absorption coefficient dependence on pressure and temperature. It is particularly important to consider line-broadening and central-frequency-shifting effects induced by high-pressure operation. PLIF is used to examine jet flames formed by a single coaxial injector fed by liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen (LOx/GH(2)) in subcritical and transcritical regimes. In the latter case, the liquid oxygen temperature is below its critical value while its pressure is above critical (T-LOx = 85 K < TC (02) = 150 K, PLO, = 6.3 MPa > Pc(02) = 5.04 MPa). Such transcritical conditions prevail in many high-performance devices such as liquid-propellant rocket engines. A detailed understanding of this type of combustion is necessary to the development of improved and more reliable propulsion systems. PLIF provides images that may be considered to represent instantaneous distributions of OH radicals and may be used to infer the structure and position of the flame. An optical multichannel analyzer is also used in the experiments to ensure that the detected signals have the expected spectral features. Fluorescence spectra are also compared with emission spectra synthesized with Lifbase in terms of line positions and broadening. Mean flame positions deduced from PLIF images are shown to nearly match those deduced from the Abel transformed average OH* light-emission distributions. The difference is related to a biased estimate of the flame position resulting from the Abel transformed emission data. PLIF is also used to examine the flame edge. It is known from a previous analysis of the flame-holding mechanism that the low-speed wake established just behind the oxygen injector lip and generated by the two propellants must be thicker than the flame-edge thickness to ensure stable anchoring. PLIF images indicate that the flame thickness is on the order of the wake transverse size. When the thickness exceeds this transverse dimension it is found that the flame becomes sensitive to the high-speed hydrogen stream. Finally, the instantaneous PLIF images of OH included in this article may serve as a guide to current efforts directed at the large-eddy simulation of transcritical combustion.

AB This paper summarizes and compares the results of systematic research programs at two independent laboratories regarding the injection of cryogenic liquids at subcritical and supercritical pressures, with application to liquid rocket engines. Both single jets and coaxial jets have been studied. Cold flow studies provided valuable information without introducing the complexities of combustion. Initial studies utilized a single jet of cryogenic nitrogen injected into a quiescent room temperature nitrogen environment with pressures below and above the thermodynamic critical pressure of the nitrogen. Later, the work was extended to investigate the effects of a co-flowing gas. Parallel to this work, combustion studies with cryogenic propellants were introduced to understand high pressure coaxial injection phenomena with the influence of chemical reaction. Shadowgraphy and spontaneous Raman scattering were used to measure quantities such as growth rates, core lengths, turbulent length scales, fractal dimensions, and jet breakup regimes. It is found that jets injected at supercritical pressures do not atomize as they do at subcritical pressures. Rather, they behave in many respects like variable density turbulent gas jets.

AB This paper extends past analyses of liquid-oxygen-hydrogen flames at supercritical pressure by providing quantitative results that characterize multicomponent diffusion processes in the flame zone of a shear-coaxial injector element. High-fidelity simulations, using both the large-eddy-simulation and direct-numerical-simulation techniques, have been performed using detailed treatments of thermodynamic, transport and chemical kinetics. Results are presented for a condition where oxygen is injected in a cryogenic state, at a subcritical temperature and supercritical pressure, and hydrogen is injected in a supercritical state. This condition has significant technical relevance in liquid-rocket engines but is not well understood. For this situation a diffusion dominated mode of combustion occurs in the presence of exceedingly large thermo-physical property gradients. The flame anchors itself in the interfacial region of high shear that exists between the liquid-oxygen core and the annular hydrogen jet. Intense property gradients approach the behavior of a contact discontinuity in this region. Significant real-gas effects and transport anomalies coexist locally in colder regions of the flow, with ideal gas and transport processes occurring within the flame zone. The current work provides a detailed analysis focused on the effects and relative contributions of various diffusion mechanisms and the net coupled effect of these processes on the observed mode of combustion.

AB Purpose - To find the optimal number of channels of rocket engine thrust chamber, it was found that the optimal channel number is 335, at which the cooling effect of the thrust chamber cooling channel reaches the best, which can be helpful to design rocket engine thrust chamber.
   Design/methodology/approach - The commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT with standard k-epsilon; turbulent model was used. The CFD method was validated via comparing with the available experimental data.
   Findings - It was found that both the highest temperature and the maximal heat flux through the wall on the hot-gas side occurs about the throat region at the symmetrical center of the cooling channel. Owing to the strong curvature of the cooling channel geometry, the secondary flow reached its strongest level around the throat region. The typical values of pressure drop and temperature difference between the inlet and exit of cooling channel were 2.7 MPa and 67.38 K (standard case), respectively. Besides an optimal number of channels exist, and it is approximately 335, which can make the effect of heat transfer of cooling channels best with acceptable pressure drop. As a whole, the present study gives some useful information to the thermal design of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber.
   Research limitations/implications - More detailed computation and optimization should be performed for the fluid flow and heat transfer of cooling channel.
   Practical implications - A very useful optimization on heat transfer and fluid flow in cooling channel of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber.
   Originality/value - This paper provides the performance of optimization on heat transfer and fluid flow in cooling channel of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber, which can make the effect of heat transfer of cooling channels best with acceptable pressure drop. As a whole, the present study gives some useful information to the thermal design of liquid rocket engine thrust chamber.

   cycle; mixing; experimental investigation
AB The duty cycle for C10H19/oxygen injection and time sequence for injection, mixing and ignition to produce two-phase, fully-developed detonations are investigated in a pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE) model. The The PDRE test model is 25mm in inner diameter and 1.1m long. The solenoid valves are employed to control intermittent supplies of propellants and purge gas. The spark igniter has ignition energy of around 50mJ. The solenoid valves and igniter are controlled by a control system. Under some given supply conditions, the detonability limits in terms of injection duty cycle and the controlling method are obtained. From fundamental analysis, these factors influence the operation of PDRE essentially by appropriate equivalence ratio and mixing. The experimental results show that to gain reliable detonations, first of all, the injection duty cycles for C10H19 and oxygen should ensure sufficient filling and then the injection time phases and duty cycles should be kept as close as possible to attain effective mixing.

AB Performance analyses of pulse detonation rocket engines (PDREs) were numerically studied, focusing on partial-fill effects at ground tests. The initial detonable mixture, inert gas, fuel-fill fraction, equivalence ratio, and initial temperature of inert gas were changed as governing parameters. The simulation results were compared against those of previous-studies and agreed well with them. The simulation results indicated that the initial mass fraction of the detonable mixture to total mass of the gas was the predominant factor for the specific impulse of partially filled PDREs. Based on the numerical results, a new, simple empirical formula is proposed to predict the specific impulse of partially filled PDREs.

AB A design study was performed to define and compare the parameters of horizontal- and vertical-takeoff reusable launch-vehicle systems to identify promising configurations for further developmental emphasis. The investigation considered both two-stage rockets and single-stage airbreathing ramjet/scramjet-powered vehicles, thus representing next-generation and third-generation configurations, respectively. The payload requirement for each vehicle was 20,000 lb delivered to a 100-n mile circular Earth orbit launched easterly from Kennedy Space Center. All vehicles were first analyzed using liquid hydrogen for the entire trajectory and then reanalyzed with liquid hydrocarbon fuel for the first stage, if a rocket, or for the low-speed trajectory segment to ramjet start for the airbreathers. The vertical-takeoff airbreathing vehicles were found to have the lowest empty weights and gross takeoff weights of all of the vehicle configurations, with three-dimensional inward-turning inlets outperforming two-dimensional inlets, and the use of hydrocarbon fuel outperforming hydrogen fuel for the launch propulsive segment to ramjet start. The best horizontal takeoff vehicle is the all-hydrogen inward-turning airbreather. For the two-stage rockets, the lightest empty weight was achieved with the use of hydrocarbon fuel in the booster and hydrogen fuel in the orbiter.

AB The RBCC (RING finger, B-box type zinc finger, coiled-coil domain) motif family contains a large number of proteins implicated in many cellular processes, including vesicle exocytosis. The acrosome reaction, the sperm exocytotic event that is required for fertilization, involves essentially the same process of intracellular membrane fusions as vesicular exocytosis in somatic cells. We have previously isolated a haploid-germ-cell-specific gene designated haprin, which encodes a RBCC motif protein that plays a role in the acrosome reaction of sperm by mediating protein complex formation via the RBCC motif. In this review, we describe the potential role of Haprin in the molecular mechanisms of acrosome reaction, as compared with some other RBCC proteins. The conserved structure and localization of the Haprin protein in human and mouse suggest an indispensable role for Haprin in the functioning of mammalian sperm.

TI A Blowdown Cryogenic Cavitation Tunnel and CFD Treatment for Flow
   Visualization around a Foil
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE cavitation; tunnel; cryogen; CFD; visualization; simulation; foil
AB Cavitation is one of the major problems in the development of rocket engines. There have been few experimental studies to visualize cryogenic foil cavitation. Therefore a new cryogenic cavitation tunnel of blowdown type was built. The foil shape is "piano-convex". This profile was chosen because of simplicity, but also of being similar to the one for a rocket inducer impeller. Working fluids were water at room temperature, hot water and liquid nitrogen. In case of Angle of Attack (AOA)= 8 degrees, periodical cavity departure was observed in the experiments of both water at 90 degrees C and nitrogen at -190 degrees C under the same velocity 10 m/sec and the same cavitation number 0.7. The frequencies were observed to be 110 and 90 Hz, respectively, and almost coincided with those of vortex shedding from the foil. Temperature depression due to the thermodynamic effect was confirmed in both experiment and simulation especially in the cryogenic cavitation.

AB The friction and wear properties of the prevailing different solid lubricant coatings (Ion-plated Au, Ion-plated Ag and RF-sputtered PTFE on SUS440C stainless steel) used in the bearings of high-speed cryogenic-turbo-pumps of liquid rocket engines were experimentally evaluated in liquid nitrogen immersed conditions. Also the above experiments were carried out with two newly proposed solid lubricant coatings of sputter-ion-plated MoSTi and a new ion-plated Pb on SUS440C stainless steel. The friction coefficient and wear rates of the coatings of ion-plated Au, ion-plated Ag, RF-sputtered PTFE, the new ion-plated Pb and MoS2Ti-SIP (with coating thickness of 0.7 +/- 0.1 mu m) on SUS440C steel against SUS440C stainless steel ball in liquid nitrogen were compared. Worn surfaces were examined microscopically with a microscope and a profilometer for understanding the mechanisms of friction and wear and transfer film lubrication in liquid nitrogen. It is found that the newly proposed solid lubricant coatings are showing promising results for their use in liquid nitrogen immersed conditions. The sputter-ion-plated MoSTi coating on SUS 440C steel shows a minimum value of friction coefficient (mu=0.015) and wear rate (w(c)=0.56 x 10(-6) mm(3)/N m ) in liquid nitrogen.

AB A numerical approach for the aeroelastical stability of an over-expanded rocket engine is proposed in this paper. The main idea is to offer a better understanding of the repercussions likely to appear from the aeroelastic coupling in terms of side loads that may be responsible for damage effects on the engine. After a brief description of the stability model issued from previous works (Pekkari's team) and details upon a numerical fluid-structure coupling code, comparative calculations are conducted. The stability model is then called into question and a finer analysis is proposed to explain its major tendency to over-predict the aeroclastic frequency shift in comparison with numerical Coupling results.

AB In some liquid-propellant rocket engines, the liquid-oxygen (LOX) boost pump is driven by a turbine that is powered by high-pressure gaseous oxygen. Once it exits the turbine, this gaseous oxygen can be salvaged by injecting it into the subcooled LOX exiting the boost pump. If the main LOX pump is to function correctly under these circumstances, complete condensation of the gaseous oxygen must quickly follow its injection into the boost-pump discharge. The current investigation uses steam and water in a simple rig that allows the condensation process to be visualized and quantified. This paper offers dimensionless-parameter correlations of the data and trends observed.

AB During the brazing process of the rocket engine's nozzle skirt assembly made from Fe-Ni based super alloy pipes with Pd based brazing filler, the erosion corrosion pits were sometimes engraved on those pipes' surface. The corrosion is considered to be assisted by the dynamic flow of the molten brazing filler. In order to estimate the amount of erosion corrosion and to prevent it, the solubility and the dissolution rate of Ni to the molten Ag-Cu-Pd brazing filler are measured experimentally. The Ni crucible poured with the Ag-Cu-Pd brazing filler was heated up to 1320 K and quenched after the various keeping time. The microstructure of the solidified brazing filler part's cross sections was observed, and the amount of the dissolved Ni was estimated using the image processing technique. The solubility was about 5.53 mass% and the initial dissolution rate was 6.28 x 10(-3) mass%/s. Using these data, more elaborate dynamic flow simulation will be able to conduct.

AB Ro52 is one of the major autoantigens targeted in the autoimmune disease Sjogren syndrome. By sequence similarity, Ro52 belongs to the RING-B-box-coiled-coil (RBCC) protein family. Disease-related antibodies bind Ro52 in a conformation-dependent way both in the coiled-coil region and in the Zn2+-binding Ring-B-box region. Primarily associated with Sjogren syndrome, Ro52 autoantibodies directed to a specific, partially structured epitope in the coiled-coil region may also induce a congenital heart block in the fetus of pregnant Ro52-positive mothers. To improve our understanding of the pathogenic effects of autoantibody binding to the Zn2+-binding region, a multianalytical mapping of its structural, biophysical, and antigenic properties is presented. Structure content and ligand binding of subregions, dissected by peptide synthesis and subcloning, were analyzed by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. A novel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry strategy for time-resolved proteolysis experiments of large protein domains was developed to facilitate analysis and to help resolve the tertiary arrangement of the entire RBCC subregion. The linker region between the RING and B-box motifs is crucial for full folding, and Zn2+ affinity of the RING-B-box region is further protected in the entire RBCC region and appears to interact with the coiled-coil region. Murine monoclonal antibodies raised toward the RING-B-box region were primarily directed toward the linker, further supporting a highly functional role for the linker in a cellular environment. Taken together with our previous analysis of autoantigenic epitopes in the coiled-coil region, localization of autoantigenic epitopes in Ro52 appears closely related to molecular functionalities.

   boundaries using model chamber
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE combustion instability; stability boundary; hot-fire injector test;
   model combustion chamber
AB This study realizes the conceptual method to predict combustion instability in actual full-scale combustion chamber of rocket engines by experimental tests with model (sub-scale) chamber. The model chamber was designed based on the methodologies proposed in the previous work regarding geometrical dimensions and operating conditions, and hot-fire test procedures were followed to obtain stability boundaries. From the experimental tests, two instability regions are presented by the parameters of combustion-chamber pressure and mixture (oxidizer/fuel) ratio, which are customary for combustor designers. It is found that instability characteristics in the chamber with the adopted jet injectors can be explained by the correlation between the characteristic burning or mixing time and the characteristic acoustic time. In each instability region, dynamic behaviors of flames are investigated to verify the hydrodynamically-derived characteristic lengths of the jet injectors. Large-amplitude pressure oscillation observed in upper instability region is found to be generated by lifted-off flames.

AB From October 1987 until 1993, the US Department of Defense conducted the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion program. This program's objective was to design and develop a high specific impulse, high thrust-to-weight nuclear thermal rocket engine for upper stage applications. The author was the program manager for this program until 1992. Numerous analytical, programmatic and experimental results were generated during this period of time. This paper reviews the accomplishments of the program and highlights the importance of prototypic testing for all aspects of a space nuclear program so that a reliable and safe system compliant with all regulatory requirements can be effectively engineered. Specifically, the paper will recount how many non-prototypic tests we performed only to have more representative tests consistently generate different results. This was particularly true in area of direct nuclear heat generation. As nuclear tests are generally much more expensive than non-nuclear tests, programs attempt to avoid such tests in favor of less expensive non-nuclear tests. Each time this approach was followed, the SNTP program found these tests to not be verified by nuclear heated testing. Hence the author recommends that wherever possible, a spiral development approach that includes exploratory and confirmatory experimental testing be employed to ensure a viable design.

These cells control heat exchanges, They induce ejections and sweeps close to the convex wall when it is heated. In this case the Nusselt number undergoes strong transverse fluctuations which might induce material alterations.

AB The spectral radiant characteristics of plume particles of a solid rocket engine are important in the design of the engine specific impulse, ablative material, and plume flame hiding. These parameters are measured from tests of the engine. Some equipment has been established to realize particle heating, uniform particle distribution, and measurements based on an FTIR spectral instrument. The equipment is based on SiC heating and is divided into a warm-up chamber and a measurement chamber to improve the particle temperature stability. A special design of uniform particle distribution combined with an acoustic levitation device is used to determine the particle falling speed. The spectral characteristics and the transmission rate of the particles have been measured by using the system including a standard blackbody, an assembled optical system, and an FTIR spectrometer. The measurements of particle concentration and temperature are given in detail. The instrument specifications are as follows: temperature range - 60-1500 degrees C; spectral range - 0.60-25 mu m; and particle dimension range - 10-500 mu m.

AB The processing of multi-wavelength pyrometer data is a problem that needs further improvements. The solutions developed in earlier decades generally assumed one particular mathematical relation for emissivity versus wavelength in the wavelength range of the measurements. Sometimes this assumption worked and produced acceptable results, but in many other cases this approach provided erroneous results. Individual results were strongly dependent on the assumed mathematical relation that often needed some prior knowledge of the emissivity behavior in the wavelength range. A new data processing method for a multi-wavelength pyrometer for continuous temperature measurements is presented. A linear relation between emissivity and true temperature at different wavelengths is assumed. Based on this assumption, the true temperatures and spectral emissivities at the two continuous temperature measurement points can be simultaneously calculated. Some experimental results for the practical data processing of measurements performed on a solid propellant rocket engine show that the difference between the calculated true temperature and the theoretical true temperature indicated by the rocket engine designer is within +/- 20 K.

AB The acrosome reaction in sperm is an exocytotic event required for fertilization. Previously, we isolated a novel haploid-germ-cell-specific gene in the mouse; this gene, named haprin, encodes the RING-finger, B-box-type zinc finger and coiled-coil domain (RBCC) motif protein and may be involved in the acrosome reaction. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a human haprin ortholog. The deduced amino acid sequence of human HAPRIN had 91% identity with the mouse ortholog. Transcripts of human HAPRIN were detected exclusively in the testes. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses detected HAPRIN protein in the testes and sperm. The protein was localized in the acrosomal region of sperm and disappeared after the acrosome reaction. Our results indicate that the function of HAPRIN is highly conserved in humans and mice and that the protein could play an important role in the regulation of the acrosome reaction.

TI Role of injection in hybrid rockets regression rate behavior
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
ID SOLID-FUEL RAMJET; HEAT-TRANSFER; COMBUSTION
AB A series of firing tests was carried out to investigate the influence of the oxidizer injection on the solid fuel regression rate behavior in a hybrid rocket engine. For this purpose, a conical subsonic nozzle as the injector of the gaseous oxidizer was selected to generate nonuniform conditions at the entrance of the fuel port. Gaseous oxygen and polyethylene fuel cylindrical grains were used. When the oxygen was fed by this kind of injector, the fuel regression in the region of the oxygen impingement on the grain's surface was increased several times, which led to irregular fuel consumption with the characteristic afterburn port shape typical of solid fuel ramjets having a rearward-facing step at the air inlet. The local instantaneous regression rates, measured by means of the ultrasound pulse-echo technique, showed regression rate-time profiles strongly dependent on the geometric configuration and helped to explain the complex regression phenomenon deriving from the impingement zone displacement during the time. Empirical correlations for the prediction of the average regression rate were developed taking into account the influence of mass flux, pressure, and port diameter. Finally, a nondimensional semi-empirical correlation involving the effect of the blowing number yielded improved accuracy.

AB The results of optimizing some of the geometric design variables of the inletlejector section of a rocket-based combined-cycle (RBCC) engine and the study of its performance trends are presented. A two-dimensional rocket-ejector system was studied over a matrix of engine design variables. Bypass ratio, ejector compression ratio, and ejector/mixer thrust efficiency were used to analyze RBCC internal flowpath physics. The primary thruster exit How properties were calculated with the reacting and multiphase program, which was used as fixed inlet conditions for the ejector/mixer analysis. The computational fluid dynamics simulations of the inlet/ejector system were carried out with a finite difference Navier-Stokes code. The GO(2)/GH(2) combustion physics were solved for finite rate conditions with a system of seven species and nine reactions. Neural networks techniques were used to generate the response surface. The desirability function approach of optimization, tied with the response surface, was used for inlet/ejector optimization. This approach gives the designers the freedom to set up their own priorities on the response values to be built into the optimization procedure. Optimum values of primary thruster size, duct length-to-diameter ratio and ramjet burner to ejector/mixer inlet area ratio were obtained. Engine performance trends as functions of geometric variables were also studied.

AB The results of a study of several rocket-based combined cycle engine ejector flowfield configurations, those using a single rocket located along the axisymmetric axis and those incorporating an additional annular rocket located along the outer wall of the ejector are detailed. Steady-state solutions of the axisymmetric Favre averaged Navier-Stokes equations closed by the Wilcox k-w turbulence model (including the Wilcox dilatational dissipation correction) are obtained using WARP, a finite difference flow solver using the Yee-Roe flux limiting scheme. It is shown that by having 75% of the rocket exhaust enter the ejector through the annular rocket a compression ratio of nearly 2.5 can be achieved for the case where both the air and rocket exhaust mass flows are equal. It is also shown that the effectively mixed area using this configuration extends over the outer 95% of the ejector exit area. A grid convergence analysis shows the resulting total pressure increase to be conservative by approximately 10%. In addition, WARP's ability to simulate mixed subsonic/supersonic shear layers accurately with high convective Mach numbers is demonstrated through comparison with experimental data.

TI Three-dimensional flow simulations in the recessed region of a coaxial

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB A three-dimensional, two-phase, unsteady Navier-Stokes solver has been developed to investigate fluid dynamic instabilities within the recessed region of a shear coaxial injector element. Here, the main emphasis is to study applications related to liquid rocket engine injectors using the gas/liquid shear-coaxial element in which the inner liquid cylindrical post is submerged slightly with respect to the overall exit plane of the device. Because most of the previous works focus on spray structure outside of the injector, this study provides readers with insight into unsteadiness resulting from hydrodynamic instabilities within the internal nozzle flow upstream of the combustion chamber. The present study focuses on unsteady "self-oscillations," which have been theorized by various researchers. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism as a result of velocity discontinuity between gas and liquid phase is investigated as a source of unsteadiness that could contribute to combustion roughness or instabilities. For existing liquid-rocket-engine injectors, mass-flow variations of the order of 30-40% are shown to exist as a result of this highly nonlinear process. Fundamental frequencies are also identified for a range of conditions.

AB Test results are presented for short floating ring seals (D = 53.0 mm, L/D = 0.15) using a smooth surface and a round-hole pattern defined as a damper floating ring seal (h/C-r = 3, gamma = 0.34: the ratio of hole area to surface area) for supplied pressures of 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0 MPa, respectively, with the shaft operating speed up to 24,800 rpm. The measured data includes leakage, attitude angle, eccentricity ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness. damping, and inertia. When the floating ring seals are locked up, the eccentricity ratio of the smooth surface floating ring seal is lower than that of the damper floating ring seal. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds. The damping coefficients of the damper floating ring seal are higher than those of the floating ring seal. Whirl frequency ratios of the floating ring seal are lower than the damper floating ring seal with high eccentricity ratio at low operating speed range. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used for high-pressure and high-speed turbopump seals in a liquid rocket engine system.

AB A new method is described for the simple and straight-forward evaluation of a materials resistance to blanching, a mode of degradation that limits the life and performance of rocket engine thrust-cell liners. The method is based on cyclic exposure to oxidation and reduction with continuous monitoring of weight changes. Results obtained so far are in excellent agreement with known and expected blanching behavior of available Cu alloys, showing that this method provides an effective screening test for blanching susceptibility.

AB Turbulent flows in rectangular cooling ducts of rocket engine thrust chambers are characterized by secondary motions of Prandtl's first and second kinds. These secondary currents play a prominent part in heat transfer between the thrust chamber and the cooling gas conveyed in the duct. Previous numerical and experimental works reveal that attaching ridges on the walls of the duct causes the formation of new secondary flows of Prandtl's second kind. These new structures are likely to increase the heat transfer. The present study has investigated numerically, through large eddy simulations, the effect of different forms of ridges on heat transfer in straight square duct flows. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

ID GAS-DYNAMIC TRAP; FLUTE INSTABILITY
AB The gasdynamic mirror has been proposed as a concept that could form the basis of a highly efficient fusion rocket engine. Gasdynamic mirrors differ from most other mirror-type plasma confinement schemes in that they have much larger aspect ratios and operate at somewhat higher plasma densities. To evaluate whether a gasdynamic mirror could indeed confine plasmas in a stable manner for long periods of time, a small-scale experimental gasdynamic mirror was built and tested. The objective of this experiment was to determine ranges of mirror ratios and plasma densities over which a gasdynamic mirror could maintain stable plasmas. Theoretical analyses indicated that plasma magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities were likely to occur during subsonic to supersonic flow transitions in the throat region of the gasdynamic mirror. The experimental evidence, based on data derived from langmuir probe measurements, seems to confirm this analysis. The assumption that a gasdynamic mirror using a simple mirror geometry could be used as a propulsion system, therefore, appears questionable. Modifications to the simple mirror concept are presented that could mitigate these MHD instabilities.

ID DISTRIBUTIONS; SPRAYS
AB Mixing characteristics of an unlike split triplet fuel-oxidizer-oxidizer-fuel (F-O-O-F) injector, which separates the single oxidizer hole of an unlike triplet fuel-oxidizer-fuel (F-O-F) injector for liquid-rocket engines, were investigated under cold-flow conditions. The spray mass distributions of the fuel and oxidizer were measured using an optical patternator based on the planar liquid laser-induced fluorescence technique, and the mixing mechanism and the mixing efficiency of the F-O-O-F injector were compared with those of the F-O-F injector. Results showed that the mixing efficiency of the F-O-O-F injector is less sensitive to the changes of the momentum ratio or impingement angle than that of the F-O-F injector because the mixing of the F-O-O-F injector is determined by the coalescing process of two liquid sheets, whose impinging momentum is weak. Therefore, the F-O-O-F injector has an advantage in starting injection wherein the momentum ratio is usually different from the operating condition.

ID IMPULSE; FLOWS; SIMULATIONS; PROPULSION
AB Pulse detonation rocket engines (PDREs) offer potential performance improvements over conventional designs but represent a challenging modeling task. A quasi-one-dimensional, finite rate chemistry computational fluid dynamics model for PDREs is described and implemented. Four different PDRE geometries are evaluated in this work: a baseline detonation tube, a detonation tube with a straight extension, and a detonation tube with two types of converging/diverging (CD) nozzles. The effect of extension length and CD nozzle area ratio on the single-pulse gasdynamics and performance of a PDRE is studied over a wide range of blowdown pressure ratios (1-1000). The results indicate that a CD nozzle is generally more effective than a straight extension in improving PDRE performance, particularly at higher pressure ratios. Additionally, the results show that the blowdown process of the CD nozzle systems could be beneficially cut off well before the pressure at the endwall reaches the ambient value. The single-pulse performance results are also compared to some recent experimental measurements as well as a steady-state rocket system using similar modeling assumptions.

AB A transpiration cooling model that uses high-pressure real gas properties has been developed to determine transpiration cooling performance of methane in the throat region of a high-thrust, high-pressure LOX/LCH4 liquid-fuel rocket engine, such as those currently being investigated in the European Union. The model is a series of nonlinear one-dimensional ordinary differential equations for the conduction-convection of heat between the coolant and the porous material and neglects vapor formation for simplicity. This last assumption occurs, in fact, only with low thermal conductivity materials (k(wall) = 20 W/mK) and at low coolant-injection temperature (T-cool_in = 140 K), these conditions being present in only 3 of the 21 cases examined in the parametric analysis. Only steady-state results are presented; comparisons to test data were not made, because experiments to this purpose are still in the planning process. Temperature profiles along the liner wall have been numerically obtained by varying liner porosity (epsilon = 15-17%), conductivity (k(wall) = 20 and 100 W/mK), and coolant injection temperature (T-cool_in = 140 and 300 K). Results indicate that profiles of temperature, pressure, and density tend to have sharp gradients near the hot gas-porous wall interface. They also show that very low surface temperatures (T-max = 5009 600, and 700 K) are possible with a methane transpiration flowrate corresponding to about 5%, or less, of that injected into the combustion chamber. The associated specific impulse loss due to the flowrate of injected coolant may be at least partially recovered by the increase of turbopump efficiency, because pressure losses in the cooling circuit are substantially reduced; furthermore, based on predicted wall temperature, reusability appears potentially higher than that obtainable with other regenerative cooling systems.

DE evolutionary computation; data mining; optimization
AB This paper focuses on integration of computational methods for design optimization based on data mining and knowledge discovery. We propose to use radial basis function neural networks to analyze the large database generated from evolutionary algorithms and to extract the cause-effect relationship, between the objective functions and the input design variables. The aim is to improve the optimization process by either reducing the computation cost or improving the optimal. Also, it is hoped to provide designers with the salient design pattern about the problem under consideration, from the physics-based simulations. The proposed technique is applied to both academic problems and real-world problems, including optimization of an airfoil and the turbopump of a cryogenic rocket engine. Our results demonstrate that these techniques can further improve the design already achieved by the evolutionary algorithms with a slightly additional cost.

AB Dual-bell nozzles represent a possible solution to improve the performance of large liquid rocket engines for launcher first stages. The present paper studies the role of the second bell shape on the side loads that can occur during the transition between the two main operating modes of the nozzle. In particular, the design of the second bell profile is critically discussed on the basis of results obtained from suitable test cases. The analysis of performance and behavior during the transition is carried out by a.validated turbulent Navier-Stokes solver. Geometries were generated by the method of characteristics. Results show that slightly different geometries designed by the method of characteristics yield modest: performance changes but severe differences in behavior during the transition phase.

AB Protein ubiquitinylation plays a key role in many important cellular processes. Ubiquitinylation requires the Ell ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and, frequently, a substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. In one class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the catalytic domain contains a zinc-binding RING finger motif. ARD1 (ADP-ribosylation factor domain protein 1), with a RING finger domain in the N-terminal region, two predicted B-Boxes, and a coiled-coil protein interaction motif immediately preceding an ADP-ribosylation factor domain at the C terminus, belongs to the TRIM (Tripartite motif) or RBCC (RING, B-Box, coiled-coil) family. The region containing the B-Boxes and the coiled-coil motif acts as a GTPase-activating protein for the ADP-ribosylation factor domain of ARD1. We report here that full-length ARD1 or the RING finger domain (residues 1-110) produced polyubiquitinylated proteins in vitro in the presence of mammalian El, an E2 enzyme (UbcH6 or UbcH5a, -5b, or -5c), ATP, and ubiquitin. Deletion of the RING region or point mutations within the RING sequence abolished ARD1 E3 ligase activity. All data are consistent with a potential function for ARD1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in cells.

TI Modelling and validation of a propellant mixer for controller design
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
ID TRACKING
AB A mixing chamber used in rocket engine testing at the NASA Stennis Space Center is modelled by a system of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The mixer is used to condition the thermodynamic properties of cryogenic liquid propellant by controlled injection of the same substance in the gaseous phase. The three inputs of the mixer are the positions of the valves regulating the liquid and gas flows at the inlets, and the position of the exit valve regulating the flow of conditioned propellant. Mixer operation during a test requires the regulation of its internal pressure, exit mass flow, and exit temperature. A mathematical model is developed to facilitate subsequent controller designs. The model must be simple enough to lend itself to subsequent feedback controller design, yet its accuracy must be tested against real data. For this reason, the model includes function calls to thermodynamic property data. Some structural properties of the resulting model that pertain to controller design, such as uniqueness of the equilibrium point, feedback linearizability and local stability are shown to hold under conditions having direct physical interpretation. The existence of fixed valve positions that attain a desired operating condition is also shown. Validation of the model against real data is likewise provided. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Two potential sources for engine complications with methyl-hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide rocket engines were examined. The products formed during a cold pre-reaction before the actual ignition of the rocket engine and their later behavior were investigated with Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that methyldiazene is the main product of the cold pre-reaction. As a side product, especially in the presence of an excess of methylhydrazine, dimethyltetrazanes are formed. These may be responsible for violent side reactions.
   We also examined possible plume deposits, which are mainly formed in pulsed mode operation, for their influence upon the operation of a rocket engine. We synthesized methylhydrazinium and dimethylhydrazinium nitrate as well as methylhydrazinium azide and determined their crystal structure and sensitivity.

AB Compared with the conventional ground rocket launching, air-launching has many advantages. However, comprehensive and integrated system design approach is required because the physical geometry of air launch vehicle is quite dependent on the installation limitation of the mother plane. Given mission objective is to launch 7.5kg nano-satellite to the target orbit of 700km x 700kni using the mother plane, F-4E Phantom. The launching altitude and velocity are 12km, Mach number 1.5, respectively. As the propulsion system, a hybrid rocket engine is used for the first stage, and the solid rocket motors are used for the second and third stages. The total mass, length and diameter constraints of the rocket are imposed by the mother plane. The system design has been performed using the sequential optimization method. Gradient based SQP(Sequential Quadratic Programming) algorithm is employed. Analysis modules include mission analysis, staging, propulsion analysis, configuration, weight analysis, aerodynamics analysis and trajectory analysis. As a result of system optimization, a supersonic air launching rocket with total mass of 1272.61kg, total length of 6.43m, outer diameter of 0.60 m and the payload mass of 7.5kg has been successfully designed.

AB The present work is concerned with numerical simulation of turbulent cold flow in a dump combustor using Fluent commercial code. The understanding of complex flow field in this kind of combustor is very useful for designing and developing the Ramjet engine, rocket engine, and gas turbine engine. The present computations were based on numerical solution of time averaged Navier-Stokes equations with an eddy-viscosity turbulence closure using two equation models. Results were compared with experimental data for the validation of the code. The effects of various flow, parameters such as inlet Reynolds number, inlet turbulence intensity and expansion on important flow quantities like axial velocity, radial velocity, static pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate have been studied extensively. Inlet turbulence intensity is found to be the dominant parameter determining the flow field. However this effect diminishes with increase in the expansion ratio. Increase in turbulence intensity enhances the level of turbulence and in turn increases the magnitude of axial and radial velocities inside the recirculation region. This helps in reducing the reattachment length, which facilitates in attaining uniform flow at a shorter axial distance. The increase of turbulence level decreases the reattachment length due to the energy supply to the separating shear layer, which is a major factor determining the reattachment length. It has been found out that for same expansion ratio, the reattachment length attains a minimum value for low Reynolds number, increases with increase in Reynolds number, and reaches, a maximum limit. It is also observed from axial velocity results that inlet Reynolds number is not an important parameter governing the flow field. From static pressure data, it is clear that maximum pressure recovery occurs only for downstream of the reattachment point.

TI Optimal design of two-stage-to-orbit space planes with airbreathing
   engines
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS

DT Article
AB Many candidate concepts of reusable space transportation vehicles have been proposed around the world. Our aim in this study is to apply an optimization method for conceptual designs of two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) space planes with airbreathing engines on the first-stage boosters and to obtain necessary vehicle sizes and their optimal flight trajectories. First, we integrate analysis methods into the optimization problem, the solution of which yield the minimized total dry mass of the first-stage booster and the second-stage orbiter. This information allows us to determine the optimal vehicle configuration and flight trajectory for a highly feasible TSTO space plane. The optimal solutions show that TSTO space planes with boosters powered by rocket engines added to the airbreathing engines are lighter in total dry mass than vehicles with boosters propelled by only airbreathing engines. However, it is necessary to lighten and miniaturize vehicle components to achieve greater feasibility. In addition, the trajectory optimizations enable the booster to glide back to a launch site using little propellant, despite the long downrange path from the staging point of the ascent trajectory. This study confirms that the analysis and optimization method proposed are effective.

AB Niobium and niobium-based alloys are used in a variety of high temperature applications ranging from light bulbs to rocket engines. Niobium has excellent formability and the lowest specific weight among refractory metals (Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and Re). Powder injection molding of niobium powder was investigated for efficiency of the process. The sintering of injection molded bars was conducted up to 2000 degrees C in vacuum and low oxygen partial pressure atmosphere. This paper investigates the effect of sintering time, temperature and atmosphere on processing of pure niobium.

AB Injection of liquid fluid initially at subcritical temperature into an environment in which the temperature and pressure exceed the thermodynamic critical conditions is an important phenomenon in many high performance devices like liquid propellant rocket engines. This is found, for example, in the Space Shuttle main engines or in the Ariane 5 Vulcain engine both operating with liquid oxygen (LOx) and gaseous hydrogen (GH(2)). This article is concerned with the less standard situation where both reactants are in a transcritical state. One case of current interest in propulsion, that of combustion of cryogenic oxygen and methane injected at high pressure, is investigated experimentally. A coaxial injector delivers oxygen at a temperature of 85 K and methane at 120 or 288 K. The pressure in the chamber takes values between 4.5 and 6 MPa. Emission images from excited state OH (A(2)Sigma, denoted OH*) and CH (A(2)Delta, denoted CH*) are recorded and averaged. The Abel transform is used to determine the mean flame structure from these average images. Data indicate that the flame is stabilized in the vicinity of the injector. When both propellants are transcritical, the flame features two conical regions of light emission, one spreading close to the liquid oxygen boundary and the other located further away from the axis near the liquid methane boundary. The outer flame boundary is also conical with a relatively large expansion angle. This flame structure notably differs from that observed when one of the propellants is injected in a suberitical or transcritical state while the other is gaseous. An analysis of the relevant characteristic times suggests that under transcritical conditions the rate of combustion is mainly controlled by turbulent energy transfer to the propellants. This determines the mass fluxes from the dense regions to the lighter gaseous streams governing the rate of conversion into products. (c) 2004 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The thermophysical characteristics of a liquid-oxygen-hydrogen flame at supercritical pressure are investigated, with emphasis placed on the near-field region just downstream of a shear-coaxial injector element. Results are presented from a series of hierarchical high-fidelity simulations for a condition where oxygen is injected in a cryogenic state, at a subcritical temperature and supercritical pressure, and hydrogen is injected in a supercritical state. This condition has significant technical relevance in liquid-rocket engines, but is not well understood and has not been well quantified to date. For this situation, a diffusion dominated mode of combustion occurs in the presence of exceedingly large thermophysical property gradients. The flame anchors itself in the interfacial region of high shear that exists between the liquid-oxygen core and the annular hydrogen jet, and intensifies the respective property gradients such that they approach the behavior of a contact discontinuity. Significant real-gas effects and transport anomalies coexist locally in colder regions of the flow, with ideal gas and transport characteristics occurring within the flame zone. The current analysis provides one of the first quantitative characterizations of the flame structure and associated property variations in liquid-oxygen-hydrogen flames at supercritical pressure.

AB The recycling of carbon fibers from carbon/epoxy composites was attempted with a solvent method in nitric acid solutions. Gel permeation chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the epoxy resin could entirely decompose into low-molecular-weight compounds, and the main components of the dissoluble decomposed compounds were 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2-nitro-4-carboxylphenol. Electron probe microscopy showed no damage to the recycled carbon fibers. The single-fiber tension strength loss of the recycled carbon fibers was 1.1% under the following conditions: a decomposition temperature of 90degreesC, a nitric acid solution concentration of 8M, and a ratio of the sample weight to the nitric acid solution volume of 6 g:100 mL. Through orthogonal experimentation, the recycling conditions for the carbon/epoxy composites were examined. The best combination was a decomposition temperature of 90degreesC, a nitric acid solution concentration of 8M, and a ratio of the sample weight to the nitric acid solution volume of 4 g:100 mL. This method could liquefy raw materials for rocket engine shells reinforced with carbon fibers. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DT Article
AB Irene Bredt (b.1911 at Bonn) obtained her Doctorate in Physics in 1937; in the same year she became a scientific researcher at the German Research Center for Aviation at Trauen, led by Prof Dr. Eugen Sanger. Soon, the young but efficient Dr. Irene Bredt became the first assistant of Dr. Sanger, who married her (1951). During 1973-1978, Dr. Bredt was in correspondence with Prof Dr. Nikolae-Florin Zaganescu and helped him to familiarize the Romanian readers with Prof. Sanger's life and achievements. As for Dr. Bredt's life, she specified three main periods of her activity: 1937-1942, when she was researcher in charge of thermodynamic problems of liquid-fuelled rocket engines at Trauen 1942-1945, when she was Senior Researcher in charge of Ramjet in flight performances at Ainring, and also coauthored the Top Secret Technical report entitled 'A Rocket Engine for a Long-Range Bomber', which was finished in 1941 but edited only in 1944 the post world war II period, when she was Scientific Advisor or Director at various civil and military research institutes, universities, etc. Dr. Irene Sanger-Bredt helped her husband to develop many scientific theories like Ramjet thermodynamic theory, and photon rocket theory and also in establishing IAF and IAA. In 1970, Dr. Irene Sanger-Bredt was honored with 'Hermann Oberth Gold Medal' for her impressive scientific activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scramjet is an essential mode of operation for airbreathing rocket propulsion systems. Both fully and loosely coupled iterative methods, in conjunction with Gauss-Seidel relaxation, have been compared for supersonic combustion calculations. The effect of the Jacobian of source terms on stability and convergence has been investigated. Convergence rates have been compared for loosely and fully coupled implicit schemes. Results include the effects of chemical reaction and Mach numbers on convergence. Robustness of the numerical method has been demonstrated for a test case with staged fuel injection.

TI TIF1 delta, a novel HP1-interacting member of the transcriptional

AB TIF1 (transcriptional intermediary factor 1) proteins are encoded by an expanding family of developmental and physiological control genes that are conserved from flies to man. These proteins are characterized by an N-terminal RING-B box-coiled-coil (RBCC) motif and a C-terminal PHD finger/bromodomain unit, and have been implicated in epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional repression involving histone modifiers and heterochromatin-binding proteins. We describe here the isolation and functional characterization of a fourth murine TIF1 gene, TIF1delta. The predicted TIF1delta protein displays all the structural hallmarks of a bona fide TIF1 family member and resembles the other TIF1s in that it can exert a deacetylase-dependent silencing effect when tethered to a promoter region. Moreover, like TIF1alpha and TIF1beta, TIF1delta can homodimerize and contains a PXVXL motif necessary and sufficient for HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) binding. Although TIF1alpha and TIF1beta also bind nuclear receptors and Kruppel-associated boxes specifically and respectively, TIF1delta appears to lack nuclear receptor- and Kruppel-associated box binding activity. Furthermore, TIF1delta is unique among the TIF1 family proteins in that its expression is largely restricted to the testis and confined to haploid elongating spermatids, where it associates preferentially with HP1 isotype gamma (HP1gamma) and forms discrete foci dispersed within the centromeric chromocenter and the surrounding nucleoplasm. Collectively, these data are consistent with specific, nonredundant functions for the TIF1 family members in vivo and suggest a role for TIF1delta in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing during postmeiotic phases of spermatogenesis.

AB [1] Rockets using unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (N(CH3)(2)NH2) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) propellants account for about one third of all stratospheric rocket engine emissions, comparable to the solid-fueled rocket emissions. We use plume and global atmosphere models to provide the first estimate of the local and global ozone depletion caused by NO and H2O emissions from the Proton rocket, the largest hydrazine-fueled launcher in use. NO and H2O emission indices are assumed to be 20 and 350 g/kg ( propellant), respectively. Predicted maximum ozone loss in the plume of the Proton rocket is 21% at 44 km altitude. Plume ozone loss at 20 km equals 8% just after launch and steadily declines to 2% by model sunset. Predicted steady state global ozone loss from ten Proton launches annually is 1.2 x 10(-4)%, with nearly all of the loss due to the NO component of the emission. Normalized by stratospheric propellant consumption, the global ozone depletion efficiency of the Proton is approximately 66 - 90 times less than that of solid-fueled rockets. In situ Proton plume measurements are required to validate assumed emission indices and to assess the role of rocket emissions not considered in these calculations. Such future studies would help to establish a formalism to evaluate the relative ozone depletion caused by different rocket engines using different propellants.

AB With regard to the development of a liquid-fuel rocket engine, knowledge of unsteady characteristics of turbopumps is essential in attempts to increase rocket reliability. Numerical simulation is very advantageous in determining the unsteady characteristics of turbopumps, and knowledge thus obtained can contribute to decreasing the cost and the number of experiments. In the present study, the effect of compressibility of cryogenic propellants, such as liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX), and the effect of nonlinearity of flow on the dynamic response of a high-pressure turbopump were considered. The results of calculation were compared with a nonlinear incompressible mathematical model. The effects of dynamic characteristics of a cavitating inducer, such as cavitation compliance and mass flow gain factor, as well as the effect of pipe elasticity and that of an accumulator for the POGO suppressor, were also analyzed.

ID ROCKET NOZZLES; BASE-PRESSURE; FLOW; FLOWFIELD
AB While expansion deflection (ED) nozzles have traditionally been considered primarily for use as altitude compensating devices to improve the performance of single stage to orbit vehicles, they also offer the potential for enhancing high altitude propulsion systems. If intended to only operate in near vacuum conditions, the complexity of analysis and inherent risks involved in the ED concept are greatly reduced. An integrated approach to the design and performance analysis of such nozzles is presented, comprising a mixture of computational fluid dynamics, the method of characteristics, and a semi-empirical model to allow full analysis of the closed wake flow-field of an ED nozzle. While it is demonstrated that the influence of the parameters used to define the throat region is critical to the successful application of the ED nozzle, it is also shown that with careful design the weight savings possible are significant. The analysis method itself is flexible and rapid, and lends itself well to incremental improvements in accuracy as the flow under consideration becomes better understood.

AB Numerical simulations have been performed to assess the nonlinear, unsteady behavior of fuel jets emanating from an injector in the presence of a transverse (tangential) acoustic wave. Conditions for the simulations have been set to pertain to injector designs used during the development of the F-1 liquid rocket engine. Results indicate that injector designs which were unstable have substantial coupling between the acoustic wave and the natural frequency of oscillation of the fuel column emanating from the orifice. This instability scenario is discussed in the context of other theories offered as explanation for F-1 instabilities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current rocket engines, due to their method of construction, the materials used and the extreme loads to which they are subjected, feature a limited number of load cycles.
   Various technology programmes in Europe are concerned, besides developing reliable and rugged, low cost, throwaway equipment, with preparing for future reusable propulsion technologies. One of the key roles for realizing reusable engine components is the use of modem and innovative materials. One of the key technologies which concern various engine manufacturers worldwide is the development of fibre-reinforced ceramics-ceramic matrix composites. The advantages for the developers are obvious-the low specific weight, the high specific strength over a large temperature range, and their great damage tolerance compared to monolithic ceramics make this material class extremely interesting as a construction material.
   Over the past years, the Astrium company (formerly DASA) has, together with various partners, worked intensively on developing components for hypersonic engines and liquid rocket propulsion systems. In the year 2000, various hot-firing tests with subscale (scale 1:5) and full-scale nozzle extensions were conducted. In this year, a further decisive milestone was achieved in the sector of small thrusters, and long-term tests served to demonstrate the extraordinary stability of the C/SiC material.
   Besides developing and testing radiation-cooled nozzle components and small-thruster combustion chambers, Astrium worked on the preliminary development of actively cooled structures for future reusable propulsion systems. In order to get one step nearer to this objective, the development of a new fibre composite was commenced within the framework of a regionally sponsored programme. The objective here is to create multidirectional (3D) textile structures combined with a cost-effective infiltration process. Besides material and process development, the project also encompasses the development of special metal/ceramic and ceramic/ceramic joining techniques as well as studying and verifying non destructive investigation processes for the purpose of testing components. @ 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The temperature depression of liquids due to latent heat of vaporization causes vapor pressure depression and suppresses cavity growth. This phenomenon is called "thermodynamic effect of cavitation." This effect is especially significant in cryogenic fluids such as LOX and LH2. Due to this effect, the performance of hydraulic equipment for cryogenic fluids, such as turbopumps of rocket engines, is not as bad as predicted. In this paper, the size of the cavity in cryogenic fluid is estimated numerically taking the thermodynamic effect of cavitation into consideration. A cavity is assumed to be a sheet cavity. From the results, the effects of the properties of liquid and Reynolds number on the thermodynamic effect of cavitation are investigated.

ID ENTRAINMENT; EJECTORS
AB A theory of the ideal jet thrust augmentor is presented. The conditions of optimal outflow of the active (primary) and passive (secondary) jets from the device under consideration are obtained by solving the variational problem of maximum average thrust realization. The inlet values of the mass and total enthalpy fluxes for both flows, their entropies, and the inlet value of the passive-gas momentum component parallel to the flight velocity are preassigned. These conditions correspond to the use of jet engines, including a bypass turbojet gas generator, operating in steady mode, as well as a pulsed detonation rocket engine, as the high-pressure gas source. Along with the work done by the high-pressure gas on the low-pressure one, the gases may exchange heat. The possibility of heat transfer results in an appreciable increase in ideal thrust augmentor performance.

AB Hot section components in high-performance aircraft and rocket engines are increasingly being made of single crystal nickel superalloys such as PWA1480, PWA1484, CMSX-4, and Rene N-4 as these materials provide superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance, and thermomechanical fatigue capabilities over their polycrystalline counterparts. Fatigue-failures in PWA1480 single crystal nickel-base superalloy turbine blades used in the space shuttle main engine fuel turbopump are discussed. During testing many turbine blades experienced stage II noncrystallographic fatigue cracks with multiple origins at the core leading edge radius and extending down the airfoil span along the core surface. The longer cracks transitioned from stage II fatigue to crystallographic stage I fatigue propagation, on octahedral planes. An investigation of crack depths on the population of blades as a function of secondary crystallographic orientation (beta) revealed that for beta=45 +/- 15 deg tip cracks arrested after some growth or did not initiate at all. Finite element analysis of stress response at the blade tip, as a function of primary and secondary crystal orientation, revealed that there are preferential beta orientations for which crack growth is minimized at the blade tip. To assess blade fatigue life and durability extensive testing of uniaxial single crystal specimens with different orientations has been tested over a wide temperature range in air and hydrogen. A detailed analysis of the experimentally determined low cycle fatigue properties for PWA1480 and SC 7-14-6 single crystal materials as a function of specimen crystallographic orientation is presented at high temperature (75degreesF-1800degreesF) in high-pressure hydrogen and air Fatigue failure parameters are investigated for low cycle fatigue data of single crystal material based on the shear stress amplitudes on the 24 octahedral and 6 cube slip systems for FCC single crystals. The max shear stress amplitude [Deltatau(max)] on the slip planes reduces the scatter in the low cycle fatigue data and is found to be a good fatigue damage parameter, especially at elevated temperatures. The parameter Delta tau(max) did not characterize the room temperature low cycle fatigue data in high-pressure hydrogen well because of the noncrystallographic eutectic failure mechanism activated by hydrogen at room temperature. Fatigue life equations are developed for various temperature ranges and environmental conditions based on power-law curve fits of the failure parameter with low cycle fatigue test data. These curve fits can be used for assessing blade fatigue life.

ID BOUNDARY-LAYER; PRESSURE
AB The operation of rocket engines in the overexpanded mode, that is, with the ambient pressure considerably higher than the nozzle exit wall pressure, can result in dangerous lateral loads acting on the nozzle. These loads occur as the boundary layer separates from the nozzle wall and the pressure distribution deviates from its usual axisymmetric shape. Different aerodynamic or even coupled aerodynamic/structural mechanic reasons can cause an asymmetric pressure distribution. A number of subscale tests have been performed, and three potential origins of side loads were observed and investigated, namely, the pressure fluctuations in the separation and recirculation zone due to the unsteadiness of the separation location, the transition of separation pattern between free-shock separation and restricted-shock separation, and aeroelastic coupling, which indeed cannot cause but do amply existing side loads to significant levels. All three mechanisms are described in detail, and methods are presented to calculate their magnitude and pressure ratio at which they occur.

AB The results of research into the optical phenomena produced by rocket exhaust products in the upper atmosphere are presented. The data were obtained during routine observations of auroras by all-sky cameras from 1975 to 1990 from the Kola peninsula and Arckchangelsk region. The observed rocket launches were carried out from the Plesetsk and White Sea launch sites during both nighttime and twilight periods. The observed phenomena can be divided into two main types: local phenomena with long development times and relatively short-lived large-scale ones. The characteristic properties of both types are determined, in the first instance, by the type of rocket engines used (solid or liquid propellant) and their operating mode. The most intense, large-scale and dynamic phenomena are caused by separation of rocket stages and shutoff of solid-fuel rocket engines.

AB In most cryogenic liquid rocket engines, liquid oxygen manifold and injector are not thermally insulated from room temperature environment for the purpose of reducing system complexity and weight. This feature of cryogenic liquid supply system results in the situation that liquid oxygen flow is vaporized especially in the vicinity of the manifold and the injector wall. The transient two-phase flow tendency is severe for low combustion pressure rocket engine Without using turbo-pump. This paper focuses on the two-phase flow phenomena of liquid oxygen in low combustion pressure rocket engine. The KSR-III (Korea Sounding Rocket) engine test data is thoroughly analyzed to estimate the vapor fraction of liquid oxygen flow near the engine manifold and the injector. During the cold flow and the combustion tests of the KSR-III Engine, the static and dynamic pressures are measured at the engine inlet, the liquid oxygen manifold and the combustion chamber. The manifold outer wall and the inner wall temperatures are also measured. In this paper, we present the experimental investigation on the vapor generation, the vapor mass fraction, and the boiling characteristics of the liquid oxygen flow in the engine manifold and injector.

AB A direct non-parametric method was used to calculate reference (physiological) haematology values for farmed 10-12-month rainbow trout of the Kamloops strain (mean weight: 330+/-131 g) with respect to red blood cell counts (RBCc), haematocrit values (Hct), haemoglobin concentrations (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentrations (MCHC). The fish in the selected reference group (n=798) were given dry pelleted diets that contained 37-47% crude protein, 7-18% crude fat and 108-300-mg vitamin E, 1.08-5-mg folic acid, 0.018-0.05-mg vitamin B-12, 48-64.5-mg iron, 4.5-8.4-mg copper and 0.18-0.24-mg selenium supplied per kg of diet. Ethoxyquin and butylhydroxytoluol were used to protect the fat component against oxidation. The fish were kept at a stocking density of 50kg per cubic metre in tanks provided with running freshwater (dissolved oxygen 8.4-11.5 mg L-1, with O-2 saturation of 77-98%) at an ambient temperature of 0.2-16degreesC. Blood was sampled between September and November at a photoperiod of 9-13 h:11-15 h (light:dark). Reference ranges for the preceding haematological indices were as follows in immature females (males): RBCc, 0.77-1.42T L-1 (T - tera, 10(12)) (0.98-1.55T L-1); Hct, 0.304-0.502 (0.34-0.546); Hb, 54-93 g L-1 (59-97 g L-1); MCV, 282-469 fL (279-434 fL); MCH, 51-86 pg (47-78 pg); MCHC, 0.15-0.22 (0.15-0.2). In males, values for RBCc, Hct and Hb were significantly higher (P=0.01 and 0.0000 respectively) and those for MCV, MCH and MCHC were significantly lower (P=0.01 and 0.0002 respectively) than in immature females. Nutritional and environmental factors affecting erythropoiesis in trout and some correlations between haematological (RBCc, Hb, Hct) and biochemical indices of the blood plasma (total protein, cholesterol) are discussed.

DE spaceplane design; SKYLON; CFRP space frame; fuselage structure
AB A reusable SSTO spaceplane employing dual mode airbreathing/rocket engines, such as SKYLON, has a voluminous fuselage in order to accommodate the considerable quantities of hydrogen fuel needed for the ascent. The loading intensity which this fuselage has to withstand is relatively low due to the modest in-flight inertial accelerations coupled with the very low density of liquid hydrogen. Also the requirement to accommodate considerable temperature differentials between the internal cryogenic tankage and the aerodynamically heated outer skin of the vehicle imposes an additional design constraint that results in an optimum fuselage structural concept very different to conventional aircraft or rocket practice. Several different structural concepts exist for the primary loadbearing structure. This paper explores the design possibilities of the various types and explains why an independent near ambient temperature CFRP truss structure was selected for the SKYLON vehicle. The construction of such a truss structure, at a scale not witnessed since the days of the airship, poses a number of manufacturing and design difficulties. In particular the construction of the nodes and their attachment to the struts is considered to be a key issue. This paper describes the current design status of the overall truss geometry, strut construction and manufacturing route, and the final method of assembly. The results of a preliminary strut and node test programme are presented which give confidence that the design targets will eventually be met.

DT Article
AB This paper presents a study of a fully reusable earth-to-orbit launch vehicle concept with horizontal take-off and landing, employing a turbojet engine for low speed, and a rocket for high-speed acceleration and space operations. This concept uses existing technology to the maximum possible extent, thereby reducing development time, cost and effort. It uses the experience in aerial filling of military aircrafts for propellant filling at an altitude of 13 km at a flight speed of M = 0.85. Aerial filling of propellant reduces the take-off weight significantly thereby minimizing the structural weight of the vehicles The vehicle takes off horizontally and uses turbojet engines till the end of the propellant filling operation. The rocket engines provide thrust for the next phase till the injection of a satellite at LEO. A sensitivity analysis of the mission with respect to rocket engine specific impulse and overall vehicle structural factor is also presented in this paper. A conceptual design of space plane with a payload capability of 10 ton to LEO is carried out. The study shows that the realization of an aerial propellant transfer space plane is possible with limited development of new technology thus reducing the demands on the finances required for achieving the objectives.

AB We present in this paper numerical simulations of coupled radiative transfer and turbulent flows at high temperature and pressure, typical of multiphase flows encountered in aluminised solid propellant rocket engines. The radiating medium is constituted of gases and of liquid or solid particles of oxidised aluminum. The turbulent flow of the gaseous phase is treated by using a four equation, low Reynolds number, boundary-layer-type turbulence model. The distributions of concentrations, temperatures, and temperature fluctuation variances of particles are calculated from a Lagrangian approach and a turbulence dispersion model. Thermal and mechanical non-equilibrium between the gas and different classes of particles is allowed. A locally one dimensional, iteratively based, radiative transfer solver is developed to compute wall fluxes and radiative source terms. It is shown that the thermal boundary layer attenuates significantly the radiative fluxes coming from the outer regions. Particle radiation is found to be much more important than gas radiation. Turbulent dispersion of particles in the boundary layer induces a decrease of particle concentration in the region of maximum turbulent kinetic energy, and then, decreases the attenuation effect of wall fluxes due to the boundary layer. The effects of turbulent temperature fluctuations are found to be small in the problem under consideration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A one-dimensional mathematical model is presented for flows in a rocket engine that has a regenerative cooling system. The problem involves the flow of a gas in a converging-diverging nozzle, the flow of a coolant in channels distributed around the engine, and the heat conduction through a wall between the gas and the coolant. The numerical model adopted is based on the finite-volume method with a second-order scheme. It was noted that it is important to use variable properties in order to predict the maximum wall temperature in the rocket engine and the drop in pressure of the coolant as it moves along the channels, whereas the thrust of the engine can be calculated with constant properties.

AB This article reviews the study of Raman line shapes of molecular species involved in reactive media, such flames or engines, at high temperature and high pressure. This study is of interest from a fundamental as well as from a practical point of view with regards to the CARS temperature diagnostic of GH(2)-LOX combustion systems. We will particularly draw attention to recent investigations by means of Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy (SRS) in H-2-H2O mixtures at temperature up to 1800 K. Whereas H-2-X systems usually exhibit large inhomogeneous effects, due to the speed dependence of the collisional parameters, the absence of such apparent inhomogeneous signatures in the H-2-H2O system allowed us to model the broadening coefficients with simple polynomial laws. These laws permit extrapolations with a narrow confidence interval, as required for temperature measurements. The applications of these results to the temperature diagnostic on the small-scale facility MASCOTTE at ONERA will be described. To cite this article: E Chaussard et al., C. R. Physique 5 (2004).

AB Performance figures are presented for reusable, winged rocket stages launched from several large transport aircraft, including the Boeing 747, the Russian Anotonov An-226, a large supersonic aircraft comparable to the XB-70 aircraft, which achieved Mach 3.1 flight with conventional turbojet propulsion in 1964, and a Mach 6 conceptual aircraft based on the MA145-XAB ramjet demonstrated in 1968. Advantages of air launch include a reduced ascent-to-orbit delta-velocity, reduced drag, the capability to launch at any latitude, and simplified abort modes. Launch from the XB-70 flight condition would allow a 22% reduction in delta-velocity required of the rocket and a significant reduction in drag incurred by rocket flight beginning at an atmospheric density 1/20th that of sea level. Launch from a Mach 6, 85,000-ft altitude condition would allow a 33% reduction in delta-velocity; a reusable rocket of 262,000 lb launched at this condition could deliver a 23,500-lb payload to orbit utilizing a 523-s vacuum specific impulse advanced rocket engine. Fluorine/lithium-hydrogen engines achieved 523 s in U.S. Air Force and NASA development programs of the 1960s and 1970s. Comparisons to ground-launched, all-rocket vehicles delivering equivalent payloads to orbit are presented. Fluorine propellant reactivity and engine development history are also discussed.

AB Hemopoietic cells, apparently committed to one lineage, can be reprogrammed to display the phenotype of another lineage. The J2E erythroleukemic cell line has on rare occasions developed the features of monocytic cells. Subtractive hybridization was used in an attempt to identify genes that were up-regulated during this erythroid to myeloid transition. We report here on the isolation of hemopoietic lineage switch 5 (Hls5), a gene expressed by the monocytoid variant cells, but not the parental J2E cells. Hls5 is a novel member of the RBCC (Ring finger, B box, coiled-coil) family of genes, which includes Pml, Herf1, Tif-1alpha, and Rfp. Hls5 was expressed in a wide range of adult tissues; however, at different stages during embryogenesis, Hls5 was detected in the branchial arches, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, limb buds, and brain. The protein was present in cytoplasmic granules and punctate nuclear bodies. Isolation of the human cDNA and genomic DNA revealed that the gene was located on chromosome 8p21, a region implicated in numerous leukemias and solid tumors. Enforced expression of Hls5 in HeLa cells inhibited cell growth, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity. It is conceivable that HLS5 is one of the tumor suppressor genes thought to reside at the 8p21 locus.

AB Boron was chosen as fuel in view of its excellent thermodynamic values for combustion, as compared to traditional fuels. The problem of the boron in combustion is the formation of a surface layer of oxide, which delays the ignition process, reducing the performance of the rocket engine. This paper presents a high-energy fuel for rocket engines. It is composed of sintered boron (borides and carbides and vitreous compounds) with a reducing chemical agent. Borides and boron carbide were prepared since the combustion heat of the latter is similar to that of the amorphous boron (in: K.K. Kuo (Ed.), Boron-Based Solid Propellant and Solid Fuel, Vol. 427, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1993). Several chemical reducing elements were used, such as aluminum, magnesium, and coke. As the raw material for boron, different compounds were used: amorphous boron, boric acid and boron oxide. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB "Microscale light sails" (MLS) are simultaneously manufactured and launched as a matter-beam from a proposed Lunar facility. Lunar aluminum would be refined for the feedstock of this "thin film beam generator". A battery of linear, aluminum-vapor, rocket engines make up the first stage of a "laser cooled thermal beam". After a supersonic expansion, the condensing sheets of All atoms undergo light-force mediated cooling, guidance, and compression. The individual, partly condensed sheets are brought together at sufficiently low energy to form the core of the thin film. MLS-swarms can become either the reaction-mass for a deep space, beam-propulsion transportation network, the constituents of an orbital space-mirror or an interstellar, laser-driven probe, or simply be used as raw building material for outer space structures. An articulation of the beam generator may manufacture solar cells and other kinds of thin-films from space resources.

AB Selected gel propellants and simulants were formulated, prepared, rheologically characterized, and tested in the first phase of a program to develop gel-propulsion technology infrastructure. Hydrazine-based fuels, gelled with polysaccharides, were characterized as shear-thinning pseudoplastic fluids with low-shear yield stress (tau(yeild)), whereas inhibited red-fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) and hydrogen peroxide oxidizers, gelled with silica, were characterized as yield thixotropic fluids with significant tau(yield). Safe storage and handling procedures were established. A laboratory-scale experimental setup was used to hot fire successfully a small 100-N nominal thrust rocket engine with selected hypergolic neat-liquid and gelled bipropellant combinations. One-element pentad-type injectors were utilized in the tests to inject the propellants into the combustion chamber. Continuous tests of up to 25-s firing duration and multipulse operations of up to 20 cycles of 0.1-s on/0.5-s off were successfully conducted with gelled-hydrazine/IRFNA bipropellants. Neat-liquid and gelled mono-methyl hydrazine/IRFNA bipropellants were also tested. The combustion pressure ranged between 20 and 35 bars. Experimental characteristic velocity, c(exp)*, was determined as a function of the oxidizer-to-fuel (O/F) mass flow rate ratio. Maximum c* efficiency of more than 95 and about 90% was obtained in continuous firings for the neat-liquid and gelled hydrazine/IRFNA, respectively. In both cases, the maximum c(exp)* values were obtained at higher O/F ratios than those that yield maximum theoretical c*.

AB To increase performance and durability of high-temperature composites for potential rocket engine components, it is necessary to optimize wetting and interfacial bonding between high-modulus carbon fibers and high-temperature polyimide resins. Sizings commercially supplied on most carbon fibers are not compatible with polyimides. In this study, the chemistry of sizings on two high-modulus carbon fibers (M40J and M60J, Toray) was characterized as was the chemistry of PMR-11-50 fluorinated polyimide resin. The carbon fibers were characterized using single filament wetting, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements. The polyimide matrix resins were coated onto glass filaments for characterization by wetting measurements. Surface energy components were obtained by wetting with nondispersive (methylene iodide), acidic (ethylene glycol), and basic (formamide) probes. A continuous desizing system that uses an environmentally friendly chemical-mechanical process was developed for tow level fiber. Composites were fabricated with fibers containing the manufacturer's sizing, desized, and further treated with a reactive finish. Results of room temperature tests after thermal aging show that the reactive finish produces a higher strength and more durable interface compared to the manufacturer's sizing. When exposed to moisture blistering tests, however, the better-bonded composite displayed a tendency to delaminate, presumably due to trapping of volatiles.

AB The acrosome reaction (i.e. the exocytosis of the sperm vesicle) is a prerequisite for fertilization, but its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. We have identified a cDNA clone for a gene named haprin, which encodes a haploid germ cell-specific RING finger protein. This protein is a novel member of the RBCC (RING finger, B-box type zinc finger, and coiled-coil domain) motif family that has roles in several cellular processes, such as exocytosis. It is transcribed exclusively in testicular germ cells after meiotic division. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed the molecular weight of Haprin protein to be M(r) similar to 82,000. It was localized in the acrosomal region of elongated spermatids and mature sperm and was not present in acrosome-reacted sperm. The specific antibody against the RING finger domain of Haprin inhibited the acrosome reaction in permeabilized sperm. These results indicated that the novel RBCC protein Haprin plays a key role in the acrosome reaction and fertilization.

SO AIAA JOURNAL

ID RING-DOWN SPECTROSCOPY; SPECTROMETRY; AEROSOLS
AB Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) of metal-seeded aerosols and a hydrocarbon flame were studied to determine the proper experimental condition for rocket motor application. LIBS and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) were also performed in the rocket motor simulator to evaluate both technologies for the health monitoring of the rocket engine. The LIBS signal of the seeded element goes down drastically in the presence of the flame in comparison to the signal obtained from the aerosols of the elements. Similarly the LIBS signal of the trace elements was very weak in the luminous flame and the simulator plume in comparison to the measurement outside it. The intensity of the LIBS signal from the trace elements present in the plume/flame was found to be dependent on the process of seeding, the transition probability, and the decay time of the background emission. Ultimately LIBS was found to be more sensitive than AES in detecting the trace elements in the simulator plume. This study establishes LIBS as an improved health-monitoring system over AES for the plume studied.

AB The flow field, that develops when a moving shock wave hits a two-phase medium of gas and particles, has a practical application to industrial accidents such as explosions at coal mine and in grain elevator and furthermore to solid propellant combustion in rocket engine. Therefore, a successful prediction of the thermo-fluid mechanical characteristics development of gas and particles is very crucial and imperative for the successful design and operation of rocket nozzles and energy conversion systems. This paper describes an interaction phenomenon when a moving shock wave hits a two-phase medium of gas and particles with/without chemical reaction. A particle-laden gas is considered to be located along a ramp so that numerical integration is accomplished from the tip of ramp for a finite period. For the numerical solution, a fully conservative unsteady implicit second order time-accurate sub-iteration method and the second order Total Variation Diminishing scheme are used with the finite volume method for gas phase. For particle phase, the Monotonic Upstream Schemes for Conservation Laws as well as the solution of the Riemann problem for the particle motion equations is also used together with the schemes above. Transient development of thermo-fluid mechanical characteristics is calculated and discussed by changing the particle mass density and particle specific heat. For the case of the reacting particle-laden gas flow, a carbon particle-laden oxygen gas is considered to be located along a ramp. The results are discussed by comparison with the cases of the pure gas and the inert particle-laden gas. Major results reveal that when the particle mass density is smaller, there is a stronger interaction between two phases so that the velocity and temperature differences between two phases more rapidly decrease. When the particle specific heat is varied, only a thermal effect is observed while the other effects are minor. The case with reacting particles yields significantly different results due to chemical reaction such that the gas density does not monotonously but rapidly decrease due to the slip line in the relaxation zone, while the pressure and temperature become higher in comparison with the non-reacting case. But the dynamic variation would be only secondary to the thermal one. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ATOMIZERS; JETS
AB Liquid-liquid coaxial swirl atomizers are used in liquid rocket engines to achieve an efficient mixing between the fuel and oxidizer sprays. The characteristics of the mixed spray are mainly controlled by the flow behavior of merged liquid sheet originating at the contact point of inner and outer swirling liquid sheets. With an intention of identifying various flow regimes of merged liquid sheet at different conditions of inner and outer liquid sheets, we report here a fundamental experimental investigation on the characteristics of merged liquid sheets using water as the experimental liquid. The physical processes involved in the formation and separation of a merged liquid sheet are described from the experimental measurements. For a given outer liquid sheet condition, the merged liquid sheet forms and separates at specific inner liquid sheet flow conditions. At low outer liquid sheet flow conditions with Weber number less than 50, the merged liquid sheet exhibits a self-sustaining periodic separation process, whose frequency increases with increasing inner liquid sheet Weber number for a given outer liquid sheet Weber number. Experimental measurements are presented to show that the dynamics of the contact point plays a major role in governing the characteristics of merged liquid sheets.

TI Heat transfer amplification due to transverse mode oscillations
SO JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER
LA English
DT Article
ID BURNER; TUBE; AIR
AB The goal of this research is to estimate the magnitude of heat transfer amplification due to combustion instability in the first tangential mode. A theoretical investigation introduced a model consisting of a quasi-steady-state description of the oscillating flow. An experimental facility was constructed, and a few sets of experiments were conducted. The results show that transverse pressure oscillations can increase heat transfer to the walls up to about twofold for pressure oscillations of 50% of the mean pressure. Thus, substantial amplification of heat transfer should be expected in combustors operating under instability conditions. This effect may be particularly crucial in liquid-propellant rocket engines.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Copper alloys were studied for oxidation resistance and mechanisms between 550 and 700degreesC, in reduced- oxygen environments expected in rocket engines, and their oxidation behaviors compared to that of pure copper. They included two dispersion- strengthened alloys ( precipitation- strengthened and oxide-dispersion strengthened, respectively) and one solution- strengthened alloy. In all cases the main reaction was oxidation of Cu into Cu(2)O and CuO. The dispersion- strengthened alloys were superior to both Cu and the solution-strengthened alloy in oxidation resistance. However, factors retarding oxidation rates seemed to be different for the two dispersion- strengthened alloys.

AB Due to their high specific impulse, Oxygen/Hydrogen systems are often used to increase launcher performance and will probably continue to be the preferred option for the next decades. In order to get insight into complex processes involved in the combustion of such propellants, research efforts have been conducted in both France and Germany including theoretical and experimental activities. This article deals with recent progess achieved by research teams from both countries in high pressure Oxygen/Hydrogen (O-2/H-2) combustion systems. In France, the research program was conducted in the framework of the GDR group including Snecma Moteurs-Rocket Engine Division, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and ONERA. In Germany, research was conducted in the framework of the national technology program "TEKAN" involving universities, DLR and Astrium. A close cooperation between teams was made possible through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on research on high pressure cryogenic combustion.
   First, general design issues of liquid propellant engines are addressed, demonstrating a clear need for a new approach in engine development taking into account the complex chemical and physical processes in rocket engines. A brief description about the organization of the research programs is followed by a short presentation of the test facilities and the experimental setup's in use. Examples of experimental as well as numerical achievements applying sophisticated optical diagnostic tools are discussed and finally, the paper summarises the results achieved so far and addresses the questions still open.

AB Linear plug nozzles have been receiving more attention since the development of the single stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle. It is well known that supersonic external flows cause a degradation of the plug nozzle performance. To minimize this degradation, different kinds of afterbody shapes can be chosen. Instead of boattail shapes, the present study concerns the use of (ventilated) trailing-edge cavities. Various models of the afterbody have been used to investigate numerically performance with an external flow at a Mach number of M(infinity) = 2. Navier-Stokes equations provided with a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model and a Degani-Schiff correction were used for these calculations. For all of these models, the effects of increasing or decreasing pressure ratio have been taken into account, as well as the use of different truncations of the plug nozzle.

AB Operating conditions and performances of a fixed-geometry combined-cycle engine for a single-stage-to-orbit aerospace plane were calculated with a simple simulation model. With the flow conditions calculated with the model, the cooling requirement of the engine and pitching moment of the plane were investigated. The engine was composed of an ejector-jet mode, a ramjet mode, a scramjet mode, and a rocket mode. The engine had a fixed geometry in its operation. Subsonic combustion was conducted with no second throat in the combustor under the ejector-jet mode and the ramjet mode. Propellants were liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The coolant flow rate became larger than the fuel flow rate. The excessive flow rate decreased the specific impulse above Mach 9 and restricted application of the airbreathing engine mode up to Mach 11. The pitching moment of the plane would be balanced even in the space in the configuration with the combined-cycle engine mounted on the windward surface.

AB Objectives. To investigate the capacity of voltage-gated Na+ channel activators such as batrachotoxin, aconitine, veratridine, Ts 1 (formerly Tityus gamma-toxin), and brevetoxin-3 to induce relaxation of rabbit isolated corpus cavernosum (RbCC) and the pharmacologic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. The voltage-gated Na+ channels of the corpus cavernosum are essential for erectile function. A number of biologic toxins exert their effects by modifying the properties of these channels.
   Methods. Male New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Strips of RbCC were transferred to 10-mL organ baths containing oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution. The RbCC strips were connected to force-displacement transducers, and changes in isometric force were recorded using a PowerLab 400 data acquisition system. Corporeal smooth muscle was precontracted submaximally with phenylephrine (10 mumol/L).
   Results. The binding site-2 (batrachotoxin, aconitine, and veratridine) and binding site-5 (brevetoxin-3) voltage-gated Na+ channel activators caused slow-onset RbCC relaxations, and the binding site-4 activator Ts I produced transitory relaxations followed by a return to baseline. The Na(+)channel blockers tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin (0.1 mumol/L each) abolished the relaxations induced by these agonists. Similarly, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 mumol/L) markedly reduced the relaxations and L-arginine (1 mmol/L) restored the relaxations. The soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1 2,4] oxidiazolo[4,3-alpha] quinoxalin-1-one (10 mumol/L) reduced the relaxations, and the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil (100 nmol/L) significantly potentiated the relaxations by all activators.
   Conclusions. Our results indicate that the relaxations evoked by selective activators of voltage-gated Na+ channels are mediated by the release of nitric oxide from nitrergic nerves and the activation of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in the smooth muscle cells of erectile tissue.

AB The Ret finger protein (RFP) is a member of the tripartite motif family, which is characterized by a conserved RING finger, a B-box, and a coiled- coil domain (together called RBCC). Although RFP is known to become oncogenic when its RBCC moiety is connected to a tyrosine kinase domain by DNA rearrangement, its biological function is not well defined. Here we show that ectopic expression of RFP in human embryonic kidney 293 cells causes extensive apoptosis, as assessed by multiple criteria. RFP expression activates Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 kinase and also increases caspase-3-like activity. However, RFP failed to release cytochrome c and, therefore, to increase caspase-9-like activity. RFP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by the caspase-8 inhibitor crmA and dominant negative ASK1 but not by Bcl-2. These results reveal a novel RFP death pathway that recruits mitogen-activated protein kinase and caspases independently of mitochondrial events. Domain mapping showed that the intact RBCC moiety is necessary for the pro-apoptotic function of RFP. Moreover, expression of the RBCC moiety further potentiated the pro-apoptotic activity and resulted in a 7-fold increase of caspase activation compared with that induced by full-length RFP. This suggests that a large number of tripartite motif family members sharing the RBCC moiety may participate in the control of cell survival.

AB paper an overview of recent technology developments for thrust chambers of future launch vehicle liquid rocket engines at Astrium, Space Infrastructure Division (SI), is shown.
   The main technology developments shown in this paper are:
   Technologies for enhanced heat transfer to the coolant for expander cycle engines
   Advanced injector head technologies
   Advanced combustion chamber manufacturing technologies.
   The main technologies for enhanced heat transfer investigated by subscale chamber hot-firing tests are:
   Increase of chamber length
   Hot gas side ribs in the chamber
   Artificially increased surface roughness.
   The developments for advanced injector head technologies were focused on the design of a new modular subscale chamber injector head. This injector head allows for an easy exchange of different injection elements. By this, cost effective hot-fire tests with different injection element concepts can be performed.
   The developments for advanced combustion chamber manufacturing technologies are based on subscale chamber tests with a new design of the Astrium subscale chamber. The subscale chamber has been modified by introduction of a segmented cooled cylindrical section which gives the possibility to test different manufacturing concepts for cooled chamber technologies by exchanging the individual segments. The main technology efforts versus advanced manufacturing technologies shown in this paper are:
   Soldering techniques
   Thermal barrier coatings for increased
   chamber life.
   A new technology effort is dedicated especially to LOX/Hydrocarbon propellant combinations. Recent hot fire tests on the subscale chamber with Kerosene and Methane as fuel have already been performed. A comprehensive engine system trade-off between the both propellant combinations (Kerosene vs. Methane) is presently under preparation. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) calls for investments in Space Shuttle safety upgrades, second generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) advanced development and third generation RLV and in-space research and technology. NASA's third generation launch systems are to be fully reusable and operational by 2025. The goals for third generation launch systems are to reduce cost by a factor of 100 and improve safety by a factor of 10,000 over current systems. The Advanced Space Transportation Program Office (ASTP) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL has the agency lead to develop third generation space transportation technologies. The Hypersonics Investment Area, part of ASTP, is developing the third generation launch vehicle technologies in two main areas, propulsion and airframes. The program's major investment is in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion since it offers the greatest potential for meeting the third generation launch vehicles. The program will mature the technologies in three key propulsion areas, scramjets, rocket-based combined cycle and turbine-based combination cycle. Ground and flight propulsion tests are being planned for the propulsion technologies. Airframe technologies will be matured primarily through ground testing.
   This paper describes NASA's activities in hypersonics. Current programs, accomplishments, future plans and technologies that are being pursued by the Hypersonics Investment Area under the Advanced Space Transportation Program Office will be discussed.

ID IMPINGING JETS
AB The planar liquid-laser-induced fluorescence (PLLIF) technique has been known to be a useful tool for the measurement of the spray mass distributions for various spray injectors because it can obtain two-dimensional images with high spatial resolutions without any intrusion on the spray field. In the cases of dense sprays, however, it has been known that the extinctions of the incident laser beam or fluorescence signal and the secondary emission can cause errors in quantifying the spray mass distributions. Since a like-doublet injector, which is commonly used in liquid rocket engines, has a locally concentrated spray zone at the spray centre, we investigated the applicability of the PLLIF technique for this injector. From the experimental results, we found out that the extinctions of the incident laser beam and fluorescence signal are not significant because the concentrated spray zone is narrow. Also, we found out an optimal incident laser power which can avoid a nonlinear increase of fluorescence signal at the spray centre as well as obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio, and we measured the spray mass concentration of the like-doublet injector spray using the optimal laser power. In order to assess the accuracy of the PLLIF data, we converted the spray mass concentration into the mass flux distribution and compared it with the data obtained by a mechanical patternator and phase Doppler particle analyser. From the result that the PLLIF data showed good agreement with those of the mechanical patternator. we concluded that the PLLIF technique can be successfully applied to measuring the mass distributions of the like-doublet injectors.

AB The characteristics of a laser ablation igniter were investigated systematically. This kind of igniter is expected to realize a lightweight rocket engine system that consists of many combustion chambers, such as the Reaction Control System (RCS), without having heavy spark igniters. In this igniter, ignition is accomplished utilizing a high-temperature metal vapor produced by focusing a high-intensity laser pulse transmitted through an optical fiber. The laser ablation igniter was tested in a GH(2)/GO(x) thruster (dia. 1 cm). As a result, the minimum ignition energy was found to be lower than 2 mJ, and the required ignition energy decreased with increasing pressure in the combustion chamber.

AB We have identified a novel RING-B-box-coiled-coil (RBCC) protein (MAIR for macrophage-derived apoptosis-inducing RBCC protein) that consists of an N-terminal RING finger, followed by a B-box zinc finger, a coiled-coil domain, and a B30.2 domain. MAIR mRNA was expressed widely in mouse tissues and was induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor in murine peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages. MAIR protein initially showed a granular distribution predominantly in the cytoplasm. The addition of zinc to transfectants containing MAIR cDNA as part of a heavy metal-inducible vector caused apoptosis of the cells characterized by cell fragmentation; a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential; activation of caspase-7, -8, and -9, but not caspase-3; and DNA degradation. We also found that the RING finger and coiled-coil domains were required for MAIR activity by analysis with deletion mutants.

TI A technique for drop size control during throttling of a rocket engine
SO ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS
LA English
DT Article
ID SPRAY CHARACTERISTICS; ATOMIZATION; PRESSURE
AB Experimental studies have been conducted on a new type of injector which can be used very advantageously in rocket engines designed for throttling applications. The aim is to keep the drop size constant for varying chamber pressures. The injector uses very small quantities of a gas to atomize a straight liquid jet before discharging into the combustion chamber. The concept is demonstrated over an eightfold variation of injector pressure drop. A feedback control system, which can regulate the air pressure with respect to the sensed chamber pressure, based on the input transfer function, so as to keep the drop size constant, is suggested. The transfer function is obtained from the experimental data. The major advantage of this injector is that it uses a very small quantity of gas, thereby limiting the weight penalty to a minimum. This system is much less complicated compared to variable area injector and cavitating venturi valves used for this purpose.

AB It is a common practice for cryogenic turbomachines to utilize stiffly mounted bearings due to the incapability of providing significant damping with conventional methods and designs. With no damping available, the historical motive behind this design practice was to elevate all critical speeds above the maximum running speed. The desire for higher energy density has raised the running speeds of rocket engine turbopumps very near, or even above, the first three critical speeds. A companion paper gives experimental evidence that accurate prediction of these critical speeds with the turbopump rotor on ball bearings with stiff supports is not practically possible. The feasibility of applying a metal mesh damper with soft supports in a cryogenic engine is investigated. To date the focus has been on cryogenic experimental tests, rotordynamic simulations, and possible bearing support design schemes to justify the incorporation of a metal mesh bearing support in a liquid rocket engine fuel turbopump. Success of the design. is dependent on the amount of damping that the damper retains at cryogenic temperatures and its ultimate effect on fuel turbopump rotordynamics, especially subsynchronous instability.

AB This project looks at injection processes of a dense jet simulating oxygen core flow with nitrogen of a coaxial injector used in cryogenic rocket engines. The rocket engine performance is highly dependent on the injection processes such as mixing and jet dissipation of propellants in the supercritical regime. Experimental data at various temperatures and injection velocities taken by Raman imaging and Shadowgraphy were compared to computational models allowing comparisons of density, length scales and jet spreading angles providing insight into mass mixing and jet dissipation. The Raman results are a direct result of the high density gradients and agree well with the expected trend of the computational models but absolute values were 10-25% below expected maximum values in the highest density regions. The jet spreading angle investigation uses several different measuring methods showing agreement with earlier empirical models as well as the computational results. The length scale measurements resulting from the two-point correlation method correspond to calculated Taylor microscales in the developed flowfield. Of the various testing conditions investigated, temperature change proves to affect the jet behavior the most, and in some instances completely changes the character of the jet dissipation and break up.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

AB Understanding the unsteady aspects of turbine rotor flowfields is critical to successful future turbine designs. A technology program was conducted at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center to increase the understanding of unsteady environments for rocket engine turbines. The experimental program involved instrumenting turbine rotor blades with miniature surface-mounted high-frequency response pressure transducers. The turbine model was then tested to measure the unsteady pressures on the rotor blades. The data obtained from the experimental program are unique in two respects. First, much more unsteady data were obtained (several minutes per set point) than have been possible in the past. Also, an extensive steady performance database existed for the turbine model. This allowed an evaluation of the effect of the onblade instrumentation on the turbine's performance. A three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes analysis was also used to predict blindly the unsteady flowfield in the turbine at the design operating conditions and at +15 deg relative incidence to the first-stage rotor. The predicted time-averaged and unsteady pressure distributions show good agreement with the experimental data. This unique data set, the lessons learned for acquiring this type of data, and the improvements made to the data analysis and prediction tools are contributing significantly to current space launch initiative turbine airflow test and blade surface pressure prediction efforts.

DT Article
AB The problem of minimum time low-thrust transfer between arbitrary elliptic orbits in the central gravitational field is under investigation. The rocket engine is assumed to produce constant in magnitude and controllable in direction thrust, which is essentially smaller than the gravity force. Approximate solution is obtained with the use of the averaging method. Averaged optimal motion equations are written in analytical form. Using both known and the new first integrals allows to reduce the order of the differential system of optimal motion equations down to fourth. The analytical solutions are obtained for a number of maneuvers. Since any transfer between elliptic orbits can be presented as a combination of those, allowing analytical solution, rapid estimation of the characteristic velocity requirements is possible. Control algorithms more simple for practical realization are proposed, and their efficiency is compared with that of the optimal control. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the characteristics of the plume temperature measurement of solid propellant rocket engine, a new emissivity assumption was presented. Based on the assumption, a new data processing method of the multiwavelength pyrometer was introduced. By processing the measured data of the multiwavelength pyrometer at two different time, the true temperatures and spectral emissivities at two different time can be simultaneously calculated. The experimental results show that the temperature differences between the calculated values and the theoretical ones provided by the rocket engine designer are within +/-20K. The above-mentioned method is a practical data processing method of solid propellant rocket engine plume temperature.

The most intense, large-scale, and dynamic phenomena are induced by specific operation modes of rocket engines, in particular, by the staging and thrust cutoff in solid-propellant rocket engines, as well as by physical conditions in the upper atmosphere.

AB This paper discusses the relevant selection criteria for a single stage to orbit (SSTO) propulsion system and then reviews the characteristics of the typical engine types proposed for this role against these criteria. The engine types considered include Hydrogen/Oxygen (H-2/O-2) rockets, Scramjets, Turbojets, Turborockets and Liquid Air Cycle Engines. In the authors opinion none of the above engines are able to meet all the necessary criteria for an SSTO propulsion system simultaneously. However by selecting appropriate features from each it is possible to synthesise a new class of engines which are specifically optimised for the SSTO role. The resulting engines employ precooling of the airstream and a high internal pressure ratio to enable a relatively conventional high pressure rocket combustion chamber to be utilised in both airbreathing and rocket modes. This results in a significant mass saving with installation advantages which by careful design of the cycle thermodynamics enables the full potential of airbreathing to be realised. The SABRE engine which powers the SKYLON launch vehicle is an example of one of these so called 'Precooled hybrid airbreathing rocket engines' and the conceptual reasoning which leads to its main design parameters are described in the paper.

AB This paper introduces a robust computational technique named the network simulation method (NSM) that is exemplary for the numerical prediction of spatio-temporal temperatures in multi-layered composite walls in regular coordinate systems. The problem that was analyzed here deals with a composite nozzle wall of an experimental rocket engine that is fabricated with two dissimilar materials: a metallic substrate and a ceramic coating. The model involving two coupled, unidirectional nonlinear heat conduction equations in a two-material wall (ceramic coating and metallic substrate) and a convective-radiative boundary condition has been solved numerically with the NSM. NSM has its genesis in the resistance-capacitance analogy that exists between unsteady, unidirectional conduction of heat and unsteady flow of electric current. The network-simulated estimates for the temperature-time history inside the composite nozzle were performed with the code PSPICE easily, quickly, and accurately. The rapid temperature raise of the ceramic coating/metallic substrate interface from room temperature is the determining factor in this study. The time lapse to reach the melting temperature of the metallic substrate dictates the approximate duration of the ground firing test and evidently constitutes ihe primary design constraint.

TI Radiative heat transfer in film-cooled liquid rocket engine nozzles
SO JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER
LA English
DT Article
ID ENCLOSURES
AB A radiation model has been implemented in a Navier-Stokes flow solver to investigate the importance of thermal radiation in film-cooled liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket engine thrust chambers. Two running conditions were computed: high-altitude and sea-level conditions. For high altitudes, the smalls are heated by radiation approximately 3 K, and the flow is not influenced. At sea level, the flow separates from the nozzle walls and a Mach disk is formed inside the nozzle. This extra source of radiation is clearly observable and, combined with the cold atmospheric air pocket created behind the separation, contributes importantly to the wall temperatures. An increase of up to 140 K is observed in the zone after the separation. Moreover, the position of the shock is slightly affected by radiative transfer. It is shown that radiative heat transfer does play an important role in the case of a shocked film-cooled nozzle. In the unshocked case, its effects are noticeable, but may be neglected.

AB Two well-established medical imaging methods, digital radiography (DR) and computed tomography (CT), were employed to obtain images of two types,of explosive devices, model rocket engines and shotgun shells. The images were evaluated from an airport security perspective. In terms of geometrical shape, the detection probability of the explosive devices appears to be higher with DR imaging, but in terms of the actual explosive compounds in the devices, CT appears to offer a higher detection probability. DR imaging offers a low detection probability for the explosive powder in the shotgun shells, but a rather significant detection. probability for the explosive propellant in the model rocket engines.

AB An RBCC (RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil) protein was identified that belongs to the superfamily of zinc-binding proteins and is specifically expressed in the gill of eel, Anguilla japonica . Euryhaline fishes such as eels can migrate between freshwater and seawater, which is considered to be accomplished by efficient remodeling of the architecture and function of the gill, a major osmoregulatory organ. To identify molecules involved in such adaptive changes, we performed differential display using mRNA preparations from freshwater and seawater eel gills and obtained an RBCC clone among several differentially expressed clones. The clone encoded a protein of 514 amino acid residues with structural features characteristic of the RBCC protein; we therefore named it eRBCC (e for eel). eRBCC mRNA was specifically expressed in the gills with a greater extent in the gills of freshwater eels. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of eRBCC is confined to particular epithelial cells of the gills including freshwater-specific lamellar chloride cells. The RING finger of eRBCC was found to have a ubiquitin ligase activity, suggesting an important regulatory role of eRBCC in the remodeling of branchial cells.

AB Aerothermal properties in a fuel spray is a central problem in the field of the design of the combustion chambers of automotive engines, turbojets or rocket engines. Heat and mass transfer models are necessary in the predictive calculation schemes used by the motorists. Reliable experimental data must be obtained for both the validation and development of new physical models linked to heat transfer and evaporation in sprays, where aerodynamic interactions have a key role. This paper proposes an experimental study of the energetic budget of a monodisperse ethanol droplet stream, injected in the thermal boundary layer of a vertical heated plate. The droplet size reduction is measured using a light scattering technique (interferential method) in order to characterize the evaporation, as the droplet mean temperature is monitored using the two colors laser-induced fluorescence technique. The convection heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number are inferred from the overall energetic budget, as a function of the inter-droplet distance, characterizing the interaction regime, The results are compared to physical models combined with numerical simulations available in the literature, for moving, evaporating isolated droplets and for three droplets arrangement in linear stream.

ID CURTAINS; SHEETS; WATER
AB Converging swirling liquid jets from pressure swirl atomizers injected into atmospheric air are studied experimentally using still and cine photographic techniques in the context of liquid-liquid coaxial swirl atomizers used in liquid rocket engines. The jet exhibits several interesting flow features in contrast to the nonswirling liquid jets (annular liquid jets) studied in the literature. The swirl motion creates multiple converging sections in the jet, which gradually collapse one after the other due to the liquid sheet breakup with increasing Weber number (We). This is clearly related to the air inside the converging jet which exhibits a peculiar variation of the pressure difference across the liquid sheet, DeltaP, with We. The variation shows a decreasing trend of DeltaP with We in an overall sense, but exhibits local maxima and minima at specific flow conditions. The number of maxima or minima observed in the curve depends on the number of converging sections seen in the jet at the lowest We. An interesting feature of this variation is that it delineates the regions of prominent jet flow features like the oscillating jet region, nonoscillating jet region, number of converging sections, and so on. Numerical predictions of the jet characteristics are obtained by modifying an existing nonswirling liquid jet model by including the swirling motion. The comparison between the experimental and numerical measurements shows that the pressure difference across the liquid sheet is important for the jet behavior and cannot be neglected in any theoretical analysis.

AB Previous analyses of post-World War II developments of German rocket engines in Russia were mainly based on information published by Soviet scientists and design engineers in obscure specialist journals, which were the only sources giving the technical parameters of these engines. No detailed drawings and few photographs were published.
   A more accurate picture of the genesis of post-war Soviet rocket propulsion can now be painted. The author was granted unprecedented access to the archives of Moscow enterprises and research facilities. This material is supplemented by that from new Russian publications in the nineties and personal interviews with the German rocket experts who were taken to the USSR. For the first time it became clear that the raketnyje dvigateli (rocket engines) of even today's Soyuz launcher are based on the basic developments of German experts.

AB Combustion instability of O-2/kerosene, O-2/kerosene/hydrogen, and O-2/kerosene/hydrogen spray flame is numerically studied. The numerical results of combustion self-oscillation are consistent with the historical experiments. Hydrogen is helpful to stabilizing oxygen/hydrocarbon combustion. High gas injecting velocity of the coaxial injector would increase the combustion stability. Contrary to the former expectation, the most sensitive region for combustion instability is not where the heat releases most intensely but is the low-temperature premixed region near the injectors. According to the simulation, the technology steps, such as adding catalyzer to decrease the reaction activity energy, or improving the injector design to reduce the premixed low temperature region, would improve the combustion stability.

AB Length scales provide some understanding of the injection of cryogenic propellants in rocket chambers on mixing efficiency, which translates to burning efficiency and performance. This project uses supercritical cryogenic nitrogen to look at high-density core flows such as those of coaxial injectors used in rocket engines. The investigation considers test conditions from 4.0 to 6.0 MPa chamber pressure at two injection velocities and temperatures. Experimental data taken by using shadowgraph images provides a means of characterizing turbulent flow structures using a two-point correlation method to determine length scales and structure shapes. The experimental results are compared to computational models.

TI Power and transport systems for space applications, utilizing the MHD
   method of energy conversion
SO HIGH TEMPERATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The possibility of developing power and transport systems for space applications is examined. It is suggested to use an MHD generator utilizing inhomogeneous gas-plasma flows of inert gas as the source of electric energy in such systems. The plasma of the current layers may be in the state of "frozen ionization," when the degree of ionization exceeds the equilibrium level thereby providing for an effective MHD interaction with the enthalpy extraction coefficient of 0.4 and adiabatic efficiency of 0.8. Such a plasma is stable with respect to dissipative instabilities (ionization and overheating) and retains its positive properties at a stagnation pressure of the order of 1 MPa. The estimation of the mass-and-size characteristics of a closed-cycle solar MHD facility for space applications reveals that the specific power of the facility may amount to 500 W/kg. It is suggested that the propulsion unit should be provided by an electric rocket engine on the basis of an MHD accelerator, with the working medium provided by a nonuniform gas-plasma flow in which azimuthal plasma rings (T-layers) are inductively connected to the electric energy source. In a flow with T-layers, an efflux velocity of the order of 40 km/s is attained. With a mass flow rate of 50 g/s, the engine may develop a propulsive force of 2000 N.

ID EMISSIVITY
AB Previously a fast multi-wavelength pyrometer was developed in a collaboration between the Harbin Institute of Technology of China and Rome University of Italy. The main features of the instrument include the use of a dispersing prism and a photodiode array to cover the entire spectral band. Following this experience, a new type of six-target eight-wavelength pyrometer for solid propellant rocket engine plume temperature distribution measurements has been developed. The instrument can record the radiation fluxes of eight wavelengths for six different uniformly distributed points on the target surface, which are well defined by holes on a field stop. The fast pyrometer with a specially designed synchronous data acquisition system can assure that the recorded thermal radiation fluxes of different spectral regions are at the same time and the same true temperature, even with dramatically changed targets.

ID FLOWS
AB A numerical study of the cavitation behaviour of two-dimensional hydrofoils simulating a section of an inducer blade is presented. Two leading edge shapes were chosen to approach rocket engine inducer designs. They were tested with respect to the development of sheet cavitation. The numerical model of cavitating flows is based on the 3D code FINE/TURBOTI, developed by NUMECA International. The cavitation process is taken into account by using a single fluid model, which considers the liquid vapour mixture as a homogeneous fluid whose density varies with respect to the static pressure. Numerical results are compared with experimental ones, obtained in the CREMHyG large cavitation tunnel((1)). Pressure distributions along the foil suction side and the tunnel walls were measured for different cavity lengths. Total pressure measurements along the foil suction side allow characterizing the effects of cavitation on the liquid flow. Influence of the leading edge shape on the cavitation behaviour and comparison between experiments and numerical predictions are discussed.

AB Detailed models of combustion instability based on chemistry dynamics are developed. The results show that large activation energy goes against the combustion stability. The heat transfer coefficient between the wall and the combust gas is an important bifurcation parameter for the combustion instability. The acoustics modes of the chamber are in competition and cooperation with each other for limited vibration energy. Thermodynamics criterion of combustion stability can be deduced from the nonlinear thermodynamics. Correlations of the theoretical results and historical experiments indicate that chemical kinetics play a critical role in the combustion instability.

AB The RING-B box-coiled-coil (RBCC) motif (also re-named recently as the tripartite motif (TRIM)) is a widely distributed motif that is hypothesized to be a protein-protein interface. The RBCC/TRIM domain of the corepressor KAP-1 is both necessary and sufficient to interact directly with the transcription repressor KRAB domain. Each subdomain of the KAP-1-RBCC contributes directly to the oligomerization and/or ligand recognition. Little is known about the function or the natural binding ligands for the RBCC/TRIM domain of the other TIF family members. In order to investigate whether hetero-oligomerization might be a biological regulatory mechanism, we have evaluated the hetero-oligomerization potential of the TIF family members including KAP-1, TIF1alpha, TIF1gamma, and the RBCC/TRIM family members including PML1, and MID1. We have reconstituted and characterized the oligomerization for these proteins using baculovirus and mammalian expression systems by biochemical approaches. Our data indicate that the RBCC/TRIM domains of KAP-1, TIF1alpha and TIF1gamma exist in a homo-oligomeric state. However, there is little cross-talk between KAP-1 and other TIF family members, suggesting that a high degree of specificity for oligomerization interface and ligand recognition is intrinsically built into the RBCC/TRIM domain of KAP-1. Finally, we demonstrate that TIF1alpha interacts with TIF1gamma and the coiled-coil region of TIF1gamma is necessary for this interaction. The hetero-oligomerization between TIF1alpha and TIF1gamma implies a potential regulatory mechanism for transcriptional regulation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The history of over 25 years of cooperation between Pratt & Whitney, San Jose, CA, USA and Snecma Moteurs, Le Haillan, France in solid rocket motor and, in one case, liquid rocket engine technology is presented. Cooperative efforts resulted in achievements that likely would not have been realized individually. The combination of resources and technologies resulted in synergistic benefits and advancement of the state of the art in rocket motors and components.
   Discussions begun between the two companies in the early 1970's led to the first cooperative project, demonstration of an advanced apogee motor nozzle, during the mid 1970's. Shortly thereafter advanced carbon-carbon (C-C) throat materials from Snecma were comparatively tested with other materials in a P&W program funded by the USAF. Use of Snecma throat materials in CSD Tomahawk boosters followed.
   Advanced space motors were jointly demonstrated in company-funded joint programs in the late 1970's and early 1980's: an advanced space motor with an extendible exit cone and an all-composite advanced space motor that included a composite chamber polar adapter. Eight integral-throat entrances (ITEs) of 4D and 6D construction were tested by P&W for Snecma in 1982. Other joint programs in the 1980's included test firing of a "membrane" C-C exit cone, and integral throat and exit cone (ITEC) nozzle incorporating NOVOLTEX(R) SEPCARB(R) material. A variation of this same material was demonstrated as a chamber aft polar boss in motor firings that included demonstration of composite material hot gas valve thrust vector control (TVC).
   In the 1990's a supersonic splitline flexseal nozzle was successfully demonstrated by the two companies as part of a US Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program effort. Also in the mid-1990s the NOVOLTEX(R) SEPCARB(R) material, so successful in solid rocket motor application, was successfully applied to a liquid engine nozzle extension. The first cooperative effort for the new millennium, a scale-up of the supersonic splitline flexseal nozzle, was begun in 2001.

SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB A coupled finite element fluid-structure interaction analysis of regeneratively cooled rocket combustion chambers, which allows the computation of the coolant flow and the heat conduction between the coolant and the combustion chamber structure, is presented. Furthermore, the resulting elasto-plastic deformation of the combustion chamber under cyclic thermal and mechanical loading is analyzed. The developed solution strategy is applied to the prediction of the heat transfer and thermomechanical load-induced deformation process of the European rocket engine Vulcain. Based on the results, the failure mechanism of the combustion chamber and its governing parameters are identified. It is demonstrated that this mechanism significantly reduces the lifetime of the rocket engine. Besides the conceptual design by the engineer, a mathematical optimization procedure based on the finite element model of the combustion chamber is investigated. This optimization method allows the improvement of an initial design with respect to a finite number of design variables such that the stress, plastic strain, or temperature levels are decreased, and accordingly, the lifetime will be increased.

TI Analysis of a fusion-electric airbreathing earth to orbit launch vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel, advanced airbreathing propulsion system, the simultaneous heating and expansion (SHX) engine, is proposed. The SHX uses coherent beam emitters to couple energy generated by a fusion reactor to the engine flowpath. A quasi-one-dimensional model was developed to calculate axial flow properties in the inlet, combustor, and expansion sections. Models were developed for three different beam emitters: an HF laser, CO(2) laser, and electron beam. Mass relations for the engine components were derived from the literature. SHX simulations produced similar performance to an idealized scramjet, but superior performance in comparison to a baseline fusion rocket. These results indicate the SHX concept could potentially provide the significant performance increase required to meet launch cost goals set by NASA and is worthy of further study.

TI First-stage design variations of partially reusable launch vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB Different types of reusable first stages designed for a near-term application with heavy lift launchers are investigated. The attached reference expendable space transportation system is a future Ariane 5 with cryogenic core and upper stage but skipped solid rocket boosters. The design of the so-called liquid flyback boosters is restricted to the incorporation of powerful hydrogen or hydrocarbon rocket motors already under development or in operation. The analyzed layout variants of the reusable vehicle include single- as well as dual-booster configurations. Catamaran-type double fuselage stages are investigated to evaluate the potential in reducing the unsymmetrical thrust load of one-side-mounted booster. Along with their primary use to boost heavy lift geostationary transfer-orbit missions, a second task may be covered by the same vehicle to accelerate the upper stages of small and medium launchers. The additional design requirements in such a dual-use reusable launch vehicle are studied. The investigation includes trajectory simulations and optimizations for ascent, as well as an assessment of propellant requirements and vehicle loads during return flight to the launch site. Critical flight stability aspects are evaluated by static and dynamic simulations. A comparison of size and mass is included, as well as performance data of the different liquid flyback booster configurations. The relevant rocket engine figures of performance, mass, reusability, and throttling capability are presented.

AB This paper presents the detailed numerical analysis including parametric studies on the aerodynamic excitation mechanisms in a turbine stage due to the unsteady stator-rotor interaction, The work is part of the predesign study of a high-pressure subsonic turbine,for a rocket engine turbopump. The pressure level in such turbines can be remarkably high (in this case 54 MPa inlet total pressure). Hence, large unsteady rotor blade loads can be expected, which impose difficult design requirements, The parameter studies are performed at midspan with the numerical flow solver UNSFLO, a 2-D/Q3-D unsteady hybrid Euler/Navier-Stokes solver. Comparisons to 2-D and steady, 3-D results obtained with a fully viscous solver VOLSOL, are made. The investigated design parameters are the axial gap (similar to8-29 percent of rotor axial chord length) and the stator vane size and count (stator-rotor pitch ratio similar to1-2.75), For the nominal case the numerical solution is analyzed regarding the contributions of potential and vortical flow disturbances at the rotor inlet using rotor gust computations. It was found that gust calculations were not capable to capture the complexity of the detected excitation mechanisms, but the possibility to reduce excitations by enforcing cancellation of the vortical and potential effects has been elaborated. The potential excitation mechanism in the present turbine stage is found dominant compared to relatively small and local wake excitation effects. The parameter studies indicate design recommendations for the axial gap and the stator size regarding the unsteady rotor load.

AB Oestrogen exerts its influence on target organs through activating oestrogen receptors (ERs) and regulating downstream genes by means of their oestrogen-responsive elements. Efp, a target gene product of ERalpha(1-3), is a member of the RING-finger B-box coiled-coil (RBCC) motif family(4). Efp is predominantly expressed in various female organs 2 as well as in breast cancers 5, and is thought to be essential for oestrogen-dependent cell proliferation and organ development-Efp-disrupted mice display underdeveloped uteri and reduced oestrogen responsiveness(6). Here we show that Efp is a RING-finger-dependent ubiquitin ligase (E3) that targets proteolysis of 14-3-3sigma, a negative cell cycle regulator that causes G2 arrest(7). We demonstrate that tumour growth of breast cancer MCF7 cells implanted in female athymic mice is reduced by treatment with antisense Efp oligonucleotide. Efp-overexpressing MCF7 cells in ovariectomized athymic mice generate tumours in the absence of oestrogen. Loss of Efp function in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in an accumulation of 14-3-3sigma, which is responsible for reduced cell growth. These data provide an insight into the cell-cycle machinery and tumorigenesis of breast cancer by identifying 14-3-3sigma as a target for proteolysis by Efp, leading to cell proliferation.

TI Scenarios which may lead to the rise of an asteroid-based technical
   civilisation
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous paper, the author described a hypothetical development path of technical civilisations which has the following stages: planet dwellers, asteroid dwellers, interstellar travellers, interstellar space dwellers. In this paper, several scenarios are described which may cause the rise of an asteroid-based technical civilisation. Before such a transition may take place, certain space technologies must be developed fully (now these exist only in, cry preliminary forms): closed-cycle biological life support systems, space manufacturing systems, electrical propulsion systems. After mastering these technologies, certain events may provide the necessary financial means and social impetus for the foundation of the first asteroid-based colonies. In the first scenario, a rich minority group becomes persecuted and they decide to leave the Earth. In the second scenario, a "cold war"-like situation exists and the leaders of the superpowers order the creation of asteroid-based colonies to show off their empires' technological (and financial) grandiosity. In the third scenario, the basic situation is similar to the second one, but in this case the asteroids are not just occupied by the colonists. With several decades of hard work, an asteroid can be turned into a kinetic energy weapon which can provide the same (or greater) threat as the nuclear arsenal of a present superpower. In the fourth scenario, some military asteroids are moved to Earth-centred orbits and utilised as "solar power satellites" (SPS). This would be a quite economical solution because a "military asteroid" already contains most of the important components of an SPS (large solar collector arrays, power distribution devices, orbit modifying rocket engine), one should add only a large microwave transmitter.

TI Pioneer Rocketplane conceptual design study
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Pioneer Rocketplane is a two-seat, F-111-sized aircraft powered by turbofan engines and a kerosene/oxygen-burning RD-120 rocket engine that, using an expendable upper stage, boosts a 3000-lb satellite to a circular low Earth orbit. The Rocketplane takes off with its turbofan engines and climbs to approximately 20,000 ft, where it meets a tanker aircraft, taking on about 48,000 lb of kerosene jet fuel. The Rocketplane then moves to a second tanker aircraft, where it takes on about 130,000 lb of liquid oxygen. After disconnecting from the tanker, the vehicle ignites its rocket engine and climbs to an altitude of 70 miles. Although never reaching orbit itself, the Rocketplane is outside the sensible atmosphere. It opens its payload bay doors and releases the upper stage, which ignites and delivers the satellite payload to its intended low Earth orbit. The doors are then closed, and the aircraft reenters the atmosphere and lands. The second phase conceptual design study is described in which prior configuration design and optimization studies have been integrated into a viable baseline air vehicle concept on which performance analysis is conducted.

TI Rocket nozzle flow control using a reduced-order computational fluid
   dynamics model
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced-order computational fluid dynamics models for multidisciplinary optimization are investigated. An open-loop optimal control problem is solved concerning the regulation of a rocket engine thrust profile. The control synthesis uses a numerical flowfield solver as the plant model. Controllers are synthesized using both the full-order nonlinear fluid dynamics, which serves as a truth model, and a reduced-order model of the flowfield generated via proper orthogonal decomposition. The latter has been successfully applied to reduce the order of both steady and unsteady subsonic flowfield solutions obtained via computational fluid dynamics. Specifically, the application of reduced-order flowfield solvers to a rocket's thrust controller design is explored. A quasi-one-dimensional supersonic convergent-divergent nozzle with varying backpressure is used as a model problem. Treating the nozzle flow as one-dimensional, the reduced-order model is used to synthesize a nonlinear controller that controls thrust by varying nozzle throat area along an ascent trajectory. The performance of the reduced-order controller is quantified.

TI Multiobjective optimization of rocket engine pumps using evolutionary
   algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A design optimization method for turbopumps of cryogenic rocket engines has been developed. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used for multiobjective pump design optimizations. Performances of design candidates are evaluated by using the meanline pump flow-modeling method based on the Euler turbine equation coupled with empirical correlations for rotor efficiency. To demonstrate feasibility of the present approach, single-stage centrifugal pump and multistage pump design optimizations are performed. The number of pump performance evaluations necessary to obtain a reasonable pareto-optimal set for the conceptual rocket engine pump design will be investigated using the single-stage centrifugal pump design optimization. In both design optimizations the present method obtains hundreds of reasonable and uniformly distributed pareto-optimal solutions that include some designs outperforming the original design in total head while reducing input power by 1 %. Detailed observation of the design results also reveals some important design criteria for turbopumps in cryogenic rocket engines. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the evolutionary algorithm-based multiobjective design optimization method in this field.

TI Acceptance screening of turbopump gears using the cepstrum method
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID FAULT-DETECTION
AB Vibration measurements are used to assess the health of components in rotating equipment across a wide range of industries, The typical practice in most machinery analysis is to establish a baseline for a specific machine and subsequently implement a regular monitoring schedule. In a process known as trend analysis, changes in relevant parameters are then tracked over the life of the machine. In some cases the comparison of measurements between different machines is not recommended because of variability in transmission path effects caused by either manufacturing tolerances or differences in the instrumentation setup. Although these concerns are valid, the constraints imposed by the particular application to acceptance screening of rocket engine turbomachinery make a comparison between engines useful. It is suggested that engine-to-engine comparisons of vibration-related parameters can be used to provide information on abnormal gear behavior. Support for this proposal is presented in the context of parameters developed from a cepstrum analysis of gearbox vibration data acquired during actual ground-test acceptance firings of a rocket engine. The results obtained are also used to verify the ability of the cepstrum method to diagnose gear tooth damage in turbopumps. In this application the cepstrum is defined as the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the log of the two-sided autospectral density.

TI Appearance of restricted shock separation in rocket nozzles
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Uncontrolled flow separation in nozzles of rocket engines is not desired because it can lead to dangerous lateral forces. Different origins for side loads were identified in the past. Meanwhile, it is proven that in thrust-optimized or parabolic nozzles, a major side load occurs as a result of the transition of separation pattern from free shock separation to restricted shock separation and vice versa. Reasons for the transition between the separation patterns are discussed. and the cap-shock pattern, which is identified to be the cause of this transition, is closely analyzed. It turns out that this pattern can be interpreted as an inverse Mach reflection of the internal shock at the nozzle axis. To prove the transition effect as main side-load driver, a subscale test campaign has been performed. Two different nozzle contours, a thrust-optimized and a truncated ideal nozzle with equal performance data, were tested. Highest side loads were measured in the thrust-optimized nozzle, when the separation pattern changes from free to restricted shock separation. Side loads measured in the truncated ideal nozzle were only about one-third as high as in the thrust-optimized nozzle.

AB A series of static engine firings were conducted to investigate the solid-fuel regression rate behavior and operating characteristics of vortex hybrid rocket engines. The vortex hybrid engine configuration is characterized by a coaxial, coswirling, counterflowing vortex combustion field in a cylindrical fuel port. To generate this flowfield, oxidizer is injected through a swirl injector located between the aft end of the fuel grain and the inlet to the converging portion of the exit nozzle. Test firings with thrusts up to 960 N were conducted with gaseous oxygen and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid fuel. Average fuel regression rates up to seven times larger than those in similar classical hybrids were measured. Empirical correlations were developed to describe accurately the experimental regression rates over more than an order of magnitude variation in mass flux. In addition to local mass flux and oxygen injection velocity, geometric engine variables, such as engine contraction ratio and length-to-diameter ratio, had a significant influence on the measured regression rates. Nondimensional regression rate and heat transfer correlations were also developed. Throttling and restart capability were demonstrated.

AB Despite numerous recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor tyrosine kinase down-regulation and degradation in response to growth factor binding, relatively little is known about ligand-independent receptor tyrosine kinase degradation mechanisms. In a screen for proteins that might regulate the trafficking or localization of the ErbB3 receptor, we have identified a tripartite or RBCC (RING, B-box, coiled-coil) protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor in an activation-independent manner. We have named this protein Nrdp1 for neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1. Northern blotting reveals ubiquitous distribution of Nrdp1 in human adult tissues, but message is particularly prominent in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Nrdp1 interacts specifically with the neuregulin receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4 and not with epidermal growth factor receptor or ErbB2. When coexpressed in COS7 cells, Nrdp1 mediates the redistribution of ErbB3 from the cell surface to intracellular compartments and induces the suppression of ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptor levels but not epidermal growth factor receptor or ErbB2 levels. A putative dominant-negative form of Nrdp1 potentiates neuregulin-stimulated Erk1/2 activity in transfected MCF7 breast tumor cells. Our observations suggest that Nrdp1 may act to regulate steady-state cell surface neuregulin receptor levels, thereby influencing the efficiency of neuregulin signaling.

DT Article
AB Recently, there has been an increased need for evolved space transportation and the research of reusable rocket which enable low cost and high reliability and is generating a lot of interest all over the world. In the USA, the development of reusable launch vehicle "Venture Star" which will be used instead of space shuttle is planned and its half scale model "X-33" was developed for the first flight in 1999. In Japan, there has been agreement on the main points to develop the rocket type RLV based on the technology of H-IIA, HOPE-X before developing space plane type RLV. The planned reusable rocket engine was LOX/LH2 as propellant, has 100-200 ton thrust and has a throttling capability. In addition, long life and high reliability are required for the engine system including LOX/LH2 turbopump.
   The paper introduces some key technologies for the reusable turbopump which IHI is promoting for research and development with NAL and Tohoku University. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Multilevel analysis of pulsed detonation engines
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The present study explores some issues concerning the operational performance of pulsed detonation engines. Zero-, one-, and two-dimensional transient models are employed in a synergistic manner to elucidate the various characteristics that can be expected from each level of analysis. The zero-dimensional model provides rapid parametric trends that help to identify the global characteristics of pulsed detonation engines. The one-dimensional model adds key wave propagation issues that are omitted in the zero-dimensional model and helps to assess its limitations. Finally, the two-dimensional model allows estimates of the first-order multidimensional effects and provides an initial multidimensional end correction for the one-dimensional model. The zero-dimensional results indicate that the pulsed detonation engine is competitive with a rocket engine when exhausting to vacuum conditions. At finite back pressures, the pulsed detonation engine outperforms the rocket if the combustion pressure rise from the detonation is added to the chamber pressure in the rocket. If the two peak pressures are the same, the rocket performance is higher. Two-dimensional corrections added to the one-dimensional model appear to result in a modest improvement in predicted specific impulse over the constant pressure boundary condition.

TI Numerical simulation of side loads in an ideal truncated nozzle
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
ID TURBULENCE MODEL
AB The side loads induced by unsymmetrical and unsteady separation of the flow taking place in the nozzle extension during launch are a very important limiting factor for the performance of a rocket engine. The onset of such loads is not yet a fully understood phenomenon because only a limited amount of experimental data is available due to test difficulties. A numerical study of the three-dimensional overexpanded nozzle flow during stationary operations has been undertaken to try to understand the origin of this phenomenon. The flow separation in an truncated ideal contoured nozzle is investigated together with the resulting side loads. Comparisons with experimental data are given. The numerical simulation relies on the resolution of the three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. An algebraic turbulence model based on Baldwin-Lomax and Goldberg's backflow correction has been implemented in a three-zone formulation adapted to the flow topology of interest. The main features of the flowfield, side-loads mean value, and the separation point location are well estimated. With regard to the separation point location, the proposed method gives better results than the most commonly used semi-empirical criteria. Unsteady characteristics of the flowfield are presented.

AB The propellant leak is one of the most common and especially dangerous faults in liquid rocket engine (LRE). By analyzing the performance of the engine, we know that the leak of hydraulic lines can be expressed as the variation of the fluid resistance coefficients. It leaks occur in the hydraulic line, the corresponding fluid resistance coefficients will be changed. An approach is presented to detect and diagnose the leak of hydraulic line based on a strong tracking filter. The method uses a strong tracking filter to estimate the fluid resistance coefficients and to compare the estimated fluid resistance coefficients with their normal values. Then the modified bias method is used to detect the leak fault. We simulate the leaks occurring in the main system or in the subsidiary system of LRE. The results show that the approach is feasible.

DE floating ring seal; leakage; rotordynamic coefficients; eccentricity
   ratio; turbo pump
AB The floating ring seal is often used in an oxidizer and a fuel pump of the turbo pump unit in the liquid rocket engine because the floating ring seal has the ability to minimize clearance without rubbing phenomenon, For the analysis of performance and vibration characteristics of the turbo pump unit with floating ring seals, the exact prediction of the lock-up position of the floating ring is essential to evaluate the leakage and rotordynamic coefficients from the floating ring seal. The governing equations, which are based on the 'bulk-flow model', are derived from extending the eccentric annular plain seal analysis. The solution procedure is developed by using the Fast Fourier Transform Method of Nelson and Nguyen. The results of lock-up position, attitude angle of the floating ring, leakage flow rate, and rotordynamic coefficients are presented with operating conditions and geometric parameters of the floating ring seal for an example case.

ID STRESS
AB High cycle fatigue (HCF) induced failures in aircraft gas turbine and rocket engine turbopump blades is a pervasive problem. Single crystal nickel turbine blades are being utilized in rocket engine turbopumps and jet engines throughout industry because of their superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance, and thermomechanical fatigue capabilities over polycrystalline alloys. Currently the most widely used single crystal turbine blade superalloys are PWA 1480/1493, PWA 1484, RENE' N-5 and CMSX-4. These alloys play an important role in commercial, military and space propulsion systems. Single crystal materials have highly, orthotropic properties making the position of the crystal lattice relative to the part geometry a significant factor in the overall analysis. The failure modes of single crystal turbine blades are complicated to predict due to the material orthotropy and variations in crystal orientations. Fatigue life estimation of single crystal turbine blades represents an important aspect of durability assessment. It is therefore of practical interest to develop effective fatigue failure criteria for single crystal nickel alloys and to investigate the effects of variation of primary and secondary crystal orientation on fatigue life. A fatigue failure criterion based on the maximum shear stress amplitude [Deltatau(max)] on the 24 octahedral and 6 cube slip systems, is presented for single crystal nickel superalloys (FCC crystal). This criterion reduces the scatter in uniaxial LCF test data considerably for PWA 1493 at 1200degreesF in air. Additionally, single crystal turbine blades used in the alternate advanced high-pressure fuel turbopump (AHPFTP/AT) are modeled using a large-scale three-dimensional finite element model This finite element model is capable of accounting for material orthotrophy and variation in primary and secondary crystal orientation. Effects of variation in crystal orientation on blade stress response are studied based on 297 finite element model runs. Fatigue lives at critical points in the blade are computed using finite element stress results and the failure criterion developed. Stress analysis results in the blade attachment region are also presented. Results presented demonstrates that control of secondary and primary crystallographic orientation has the potential to significantly increase a component's resistance to fatigue crack growth without adding additional weight or cost.

ID ROCKET
AB Modeling results and data are presented for a chemically reacting flow from a thrusting Atlas II rocket at low altitudes. High spatial resolution imagery and spectra have been obtained for a kerosene/liquid oxygen multinozzle plume at altitudes in the continuum flow regime. A numerical solution for a three-dimensional plume flow from the Atlas rocket engine is obtained using two different Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics codes. The influence of the flow near the rocket body on the plume structure is considered at an altitude of 40 kin. The plume flowfields at 15- and 40-km altitudes are used for radiation calculations in the infrared spectral region. Calculated spectral radiant intensities and pixelated images are compared with the data extracted from the recent in-flight measurements. Comparison of the modeling with the data shows that numerical modeling is able to predict the plume structure existing at both altitudes. We find that it is necessary to include solid carbon particles as a radiating species to improve the agreement between simulated and measured radiation signatures.

AB The ethylene-propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber is an important material for rocket engine technology due to its thermal and mechanical characteristics, The improvement of the adhesion characteristics of EPDM on other kinds of polymers, using plasma technology, has been the major subject of many research works carried out during the last years. In this work, the EPDM surface activation process was carried out in a reactive ion etching reactor (RIE) operated at 13,54 MHz using pure oxygen and a gas mixture of argon and oxygen. These essays were performed varying the process pressure from 70 mTorr to 1000 mTorr, process time from 1min to 10min and RF power input from 50W to 200W. The surfaces of the treated samples were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR). The evolution of the C-OH, and C=O and R-0 chemical groups were observed. as a function of the plasma process parameters. The analysis of the IR spectra showed that there are experimental condition of the process in which the production of new radical groups on this rubber surface is maximized.

AB Determining maximum wall heat fluxes in diffusion burners (rocket engines, diesel engines, or gas turbines) is a critical question for many combustion chambers. These fluxes are often due to flame/wall interaction (FWI) phenomena. This interaction may be due to either premixed or diffusion flamelets impinging on walls. Possible FWI configurations in diffusion burners are analyzed, and a proper laminar configuration for FWI studies (a diffusion flame impinging on a wall in a stagnation point flow) is identified. This case is studied for a variety of strain rates in terms of minimum distances between flame and wall and maximum wall heat fluxes. Results show that diffusion flames interacting with walls can generate heat fluxes which are larger than a premixed stoichiometric flame and that these mechanisms must be accounted for to predict wall heat fluxes in real burners.

AB Launching is a rather important part of the total cost of an in orbit spacecraft. Following a presentation of satellization and rocket engine principles, a demonstration is given of how the use of liquid hydrogen as propellant for satellite launchers increases very significantly their payload capacities, and consequently reduces the launching costs. Hydrogen, implemented in Europe on the current Ariane 4 and new Ariane 5, is now used worldwide as it is a must for every heavy launcher manufacturer.

AB The perchlorate anion (ClO4-) is produced when the solid salts of ammonium, potassium, and sodium perchlorate, and perchloric acid dissolve in water. Ammonium perchlorate, used in solid rocket engine fuels, has a limited shelf life and must periodically be replaced. Before 1997, perchlorate could not be readily detected in groundwater at concentrations below 100 mug/L, until the California Department of Health Services developed an acceptable analytical method that lowered the detection limit to 4 mug/L. Subsequently, groundwater containing perchlorate were soon encountered in several western states, and contamination became apparent in Colorado River water. Most perchlorate salts have high water solubilities; concentrated solutions have densities greater than water. Once dissolved, perchlorate is extremely mobile, requiring decades to degrade. Health effects from ingesting low dosage perchlorate-contaminated water are not well known: it interferes with the body's iodine intake, causing an inhibition of human thyroid production. Contaminated surface and groundwater treatment may require bio- and/or phytoremediation technologies. Perchlorate in groundwater is relatively unretarded; it probably travels by advection. Therefore, it may be used as a tracer for hydrocarbon and metal contaminants that are significantly more retarded. Possible forensic techniques include chlorine isotopes for defining multiple or commingled perchlorate plumes. (C) 2001 AEHS.

DE Low Cycle Fatigue; single crystal superalloy; turbine blade; PWA1480; SC
   7-14-6; high temperature; high-pressure hydrogen
AB Hot section components in high performance aircraft and rocket engines are increasingly being made of single crystal nickel superalloys such as PWA1480, PWA1484, CMSX-4 and Rene N-4 as these materials provide superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance and thermomechanical fatigue capabilities over their polycrystalline counterparts. These alloys play an important role in commercial, military and space propulsion systems. A detailed analysis of the experimentally determined Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) properties for PWA 1493/1480 and SC 7-14-6 single crystal materials as a function of specimen crystallographic orientation is presented, over a wide temperature range of 75F to 1800 F. The data presented includes an extensive compilation of LCF data for single crystal nickel-base material at high temperature and in high-pressure hydrogen and air. Fatigue failure parameters are investigated for LCF data of single crystal material based on the shear and normal stress and strain amplitudes on the 30 possible slip systems for FCC single crystals. The max shear stress amplitude on the slip planes reduces the scatter in the LCF data and is found to be a good fatigue damage parameter, especially at elevated temperatures. Fatigue life equations are developed for various temperature ranges and environmental conditions based on power-law curve fits of the failure parameter with LCF test data.

DT Article
AB Linear plug nozzles have been receiving more attention since the development of the single stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle. To clarify the fundamental features of linear plug nozzle flow, experiments have been performed with half models because the design of the plug nozzle is symmetric. Experimental and numerical results are presented to investigate the usefulness of a half model design. The experiments were conducted on a half model without external flow and with an external flow at a Mach number of M(infinity) = 2. The results have been used to validate computations using Navier-Stokes equations provided with a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model and a Degani-Schiff correction. For comparison computations were performed for a full model subjected to the same conditions. For all of these conditions, the effects of increasing or decreasing pressure ratio have been taken into account.

ID ELECTRON-DENSITY; MODEL
AB The series of ionospheric effects caused by the launches of lightweight vehicles has been analyzed at three observatories of the IZMIRAN proving ground in Arkhangel'sk. It has been established that the interaction of the exhaust products of rocket engines with the atmosphere and ionosphere can cause a complex of phenomena in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, including a stimulated precipitation of auroral electrons. Based on the experimental data and theoretical estimations, we have determined that such an electron precipitation can be observed only at L shells outside the plasmasphere. Under certain conditions, the stimulated electron precipitation becomes self-sustained. Sometimes, when the magnetosphere is prepared to a substorm, this effect can apparently stimulate a magnetospheric substorm onset when the rocket crosses the ionospheric dynamo region.

AB An aerodynamic model for a rocket-based combined-cycle engine-airframe integrated vehicle using an osculating cone waverider forebody is presented. Emphasis is placed on the hypersonic portion of the vehicle trajectory, where scramjet operation occurs. An analytical model for the compression flowfield in the engine is developed, validated, and incorporated into a finite-rate chemistry engine model for hydrogen and air. Issues of off-design Mach number, angle of attack, and performance through a trajectory are addressed for a nonoptimal example vehicle. The results show that the aerodynamic performance of this class of engine-airframe integrated vehicle can be rapidly solved and incorporated into a vehicle design and trajectory code.

TI Two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane concept with growth potential
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) spaceplane concept developed in 1993 is revisited, and new information is provided to assist in the development of the next-generation space transportation vehicles. The design philosophy, TSTO spaceplane concept, and the design method are briefly described. A trade study between cold and hot structures leads to the choice of cold structures with external thermal protection systems. The optimal Mach number for staging the second stage of the TSTO spaceplane (with airbreathing propulsion on the first stage) is 10, based on life-cycle cost analysis. Mass properties of four TSTO spaceplanes with a turbo/ram/scramjet propulsion system on the first stage are presented, and the specification and performance of one of these spaceplanes are discussed. Two of these spaceplanes have builtin growth potential, and one of these is proposed as a prototype/experimental TSTO spaceplane to address the near-term access to space needs. The internal rate of return on investment is the highest for the proposed TSTO spaceplane, vis-A-vis a single-stage-to-orbit rocket vehicle and a TSTO spaceplane without builtin growth. Additional growth potentials for the proposed spaceplane are suggested. This spaceplane-can substantially decrease access-to-space cost and risk and increase safety and reliability in the near term. It can be a serious candidate for the next-generation space transportation system.

TI Synthesis of a FESTIP airbreathing TSTO space transportation system
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The recent Future European Space Transportation Investigation Program (FESTIP) system study has included one two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) concept with an airbreathing first stage and a rocket-propelled second stage. Because of the pure acceleration mission from Kourou/CSG and the limited technology level that should be applied, turbojet engines for staging at Mach 4 were assumed in the first stage. Two different TSTO configurations were studied in parallel: the fully integrated delta-wing configuration and the less integrated trapezoidal-wing configuration. The predesign activities were completed in July 1998, and a better data basis is now available for comparing the two design options in terms of launcher size, performance, complexity, operations, and cost. In spite of the high aerodynamic integration of the delta-wing configuration, its overall performance is rather limited because of weak turbojet performance at high Mach numbers and altitudes. Inclusion of a ramjet for operation beyond Mach 3 would increase the optimum staging Mach number and overall complexity of this TSTO concept The trapezoidal-wing configuration makes best use of a boost to beyond Mach 1.3 by rocket engines of the second stage, which are fueled during the combined ascent by cross feeding from the first stage. The limited analyses performed on the double-wing aerodynamic interaction between the mated stages has not revealed any severe objections. This TSTO concept has exceeded the current FESTIP performance requirements, delivering 9 Mg into equatorial 250-km-reference orbit and 3 Mg into polar 250-km-reference orbit. With respect to cost, this launcher could be optimized by avoiding any stage integration. Then the internal tank arrangement of the first stage is not penalized by additional geometric constraints, and stage separation becomes simpler. Takeoff mass of the trapezoidal-wing configuration is 470 Mg compared to 430 Mg for the delta-wing configuration. Nevertheless, the vehicle dry mass, which drives development cost, is 40 Mg heavier for the delta-wing configuration. The absolute cost figures of both TSTO options are significantly higher than those of the single-stage-to-orbit vehicles investigated in the FESTIP program.

TI Strutjet engine performance
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB To increase the technology readiness level of hypersonic scramjet technology, an innovative strut-based dual-mode ramjet engine design capable of powering a hypersonic vehicle at speeds from Mach 4 to 8 is investigated. Two versions of the engine are under development: a dual-mode (ramjet/scramjet) engine for missile applications and a rocket-based combined cycle engine for space access. This paper will discuss the features of the dual-mode engine design and how they contribute to overall engine performance. Engine component performance was evaluated using a combination of analysis and component testing. Inlet performance data (mass capture, pressure recovery, and inlet/isolator pressure ratio) were obtained from wind-tunnel testing and correlated with model and full-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. Combustor performance data (combustion efficiency, fuel-injection performance, and pressure distributions) were obtained from full-scale direct-connect combustor testing. Nozzle losses and efficiency were obtained from CFD analysis. Performance parameters derived from these component tests and analyses were fed into a standard hypersonic engine cycle code to predict flight engine performance. The demonstrated component performance values were extrapolated to determine predicted component performance at the end of engine development, which were used to compute the vision flight engine performance.

AB Predicted performance and features of a combined propulsion concept for a small reusable launch vehicle known as KLIN (TM) (meaning wedge in Russian) Cycle are discussed. The KLIN Cycle consists of a thermally integrated deeply cooled turbojet and a liquid rocket engine. The objective of this concept is to achieve a high-pressure ratio in a simple, lightweight turbojet engine. The proven result is an exceptional engine thrust-to-weight ratio, as well as improved specific impulse and mass fraction of the launcher. When based on the RL10 engine family, the KLIN Cycle makes a small single-stage-to-orbit and two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles feasible and very economically attractive.

TI Quasi-one-dimensional high-speed engine model with finite-rate chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The quasi-one-dimensional equations of fluid motion are coupled with the equations for finite-rate chemistry to model high-speed engine flowfields. The model was developed for rapid vehicle design and optimization, where a wide range of engine inlet conditions may be encountered. Incorporating the timescales of fuel mixing and ignition are crucial for accurate prediction of combustor performance, especially for nonhydrogen fuels and off-design conditions (where equilibrium assumptions are invalid). The effects of area change, friction, mass injection, fuel mixing, and heat transfer to the combustor walls are included. The resulting model is compared to experimental results for hydrogen-fueled scramjet engines to demonstrate the ability to predict wall pressure profiles and fuel ignition point. Application to a rocket-based combined-cycle engine and a hydrocarbon scramjet missile engine are discussed. The model presented predicts peak pressure and fuel ignition accurately, as well as flowfield pressures in regions where boundary-layer separation is not present.

AB An overview of the activities associated with the aerodynamic database that is being developed in support of NASA's Hyper-X scramjet flight experiments is provided. Three flight tests are planned as part of the Hyper-X program. Each will utilize a small, non-recoverable research vehicle with an airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion engine. The research vehicles will be individually rocket boosted to the scramjet engine test points at Mach 7 and 10. The research vehicles will then separate from the first stage booster vehicle and the scramjet engine test will be conducted before the terminal decent phase of the flight. An overview is provided of the activities associated with the development of the Hyper-X aerodynamic database, including wind-tunnel test activities and parallel computational fluid dynamics analysis efforts for all phases of the Hyper-X flight tests. A brief summary of the Hyper-X research vehicle aerodynamic characteristics is provided, including the direct and indirect effects of the airframe-integrated scramjet propulsion system operation on the basic airframe stability and control characteristics. Brief comments on the planned postflight data analysis efforts are also included.

The microstructures and properties, such as strength, fracture behavior and characteristics, creep rate and durable life, oxidation, thermal shock and abrasive as well as the effect of non-process factors on them were investigated. The results indicate that 3D-C/SiC and 3D-SiC/SiC composites as well as their components with excellent properties could be obtained by removing the non-process-factors from the CVI process. The 3D-C/SiC and 3D-SiC/SiC thruster chambers were successfully tested in rocket engine.

DT Article
AB On behalf of Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales and in the framework of studies concerning the acoustic environment of Ariane 5 launcher at liftoff, ON-ERA has adapted a NASA jet noise model of the 1970s to the near sound field simulation. To validate this model, tests have been carried out with static rockets of various sizes. Several improvements appear to be necessary for a more accurate simulation of the near-field measurements: In particular, the characteristic length of the model must be reduced, and the fully expanded jet data must be used instead of the jet exhaust data. It is shown that the acoustic efficiency, for a given Mach number, is not dependent on the rocket size and may be estimated from a semi-empirical formula found in the literature. The model changes are checked with other jets of various characteristics. On the basis of experiments and following an approach deduced from an earlier study, the spatial characteristics of the sound field and more particularly the sound power peak location are related to the supersonic length of the flow, which appears to be the adequate reference length for a future jet noise model.

AB Rocket engine performance can be modeled by considering separately the propellant delivery system distribution, combustion efficiency including propellant vaporization and gas-phase mixing, and nozzle expansion efficiency. Although these quantities can be modeled, experimental verification is extremely helpful for separately understanding these processes and for design improvements. Laser-induced fluorescence of OH, excited by a KrF excimer laser operating at 248 nm, is used to measure the concentration of the OH radical across the exit plane of a firing Titan IV, stage I, liquid rocket engine, from which the combusting mixture ratio profile could be inferred. These measurements allow assessment of the degree of mixing and potential flow stratification between the injector core, combustion baffles, and combustion chamber fuel-film cooling and can help to provide the basis for future performance optimization.

ID COEFFICIENTS
AB Annular seals are known to enhance rotordynamic stability margins and minimize vibration response levels in high-speed rotating machinery. Theoretical predictions for the rotordynamic characteristics of annular seals exist but additional experimental data is needed to properly anchor these results. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has developed an annular seal test rig and facility to experimentally characterize axially fed annular seals. Annular seals with deliberately roughened stators (i.e., damping seals) have been shown analytically to increase stability margins of rocket engine turbomachinery, by reducing the seal's whirl frequency ratio. The capabilities of MSFC annular seal test rig have been enhanced to allow high fluid inlet preswirl testing that is more representative of actual turbopump seal boundary conditions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the effect of this realistic preswirl on the stabilizing capability of both damping and smooth seals. Centered seal results are presented for both a smooth annular seal and a clamping seal. These results were obtained for a range of seal pressure differentials, shaft rotational speeds, and two levels of inlet fluid preswirl.

TI Development of a resonance igniter for GO(2)/kerosene ignition
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB (A) resonance ignition system is attractive for rocket engines because of the igniter's simplicity and the possibility of multiple ignitions without additional mechanical complexities. In this work a resonance igniter to produce a torch from burning of gaseous oxygen and liquid kerosene was designed and tested. The oxygen is heated for 0, 1 s in the acoustic resonator cavity, and the ignition occurs instantaneously on kerosene injection. The preliminary tests under ambient conditions demonstrated the igniter's ability to ignite GO(2)/kerosene mixtures over a wide range of pressures and mass flow rates. This opens new possibilities to create a compact and reliable ignition system for restarting rocket engines.

ID DAMAGE-MITIGATING CONTROL; SYSTEMS
AB The conceptual development and a design methodology are presented for life-extending control where the objective is to achieve high performance and structural durability of complex dynamic systems. A life-extending controller is designed for a reusable rocket engine via damage mitigation in both the fuel (H-2) and oxidizer (O-2) turbine blades while satisfying the dynamic performance requirements of the combustion chamber pressure and O-2/H-2 mixture ratio. The design procedure makes use of a combination of linear and nonlinear techniques and also allows adaptation of the life-extending controller module to augment a conventional performance controller of the rocket engine. The nonlinear part of the controller is designed by optimizing selected parameters in a prescribed dynamic structure of damage compensation.

TI Magnetohydrodynamics energy bypass scramjet performance with real gas
   effects
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The theoretical performance of a scramjet propulsion system incorporating a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy bypass scheme is calculated. The one-dimensional analysis developed earlier, in which the theoretical performance is calculated neglecting skin friction and using a sudden-freezing approximation for the nozzle flow, is modified to incorporate the method of Van Driest for turbulent skin friction and a finite-rate chemistry calculation in the nozzle. Unlike in the earlier design, in which four ramp compressions occurred in the pitch plane, in the present design the first two ramp compressions occur in the pitch plane, and the next two compressions occur in the yaw plane. The results for the simplified design of a spaceliner show that 1) skin friction substantially reduces thrust and specific impulse and 2) the specific impulse of the MHD-bypass system is still better than the non-MHD system and typical rocket over a range of flight speeds and design parameters. Results suggest that the energy management with MHD principles offers the possibility of improving the performance of the scramjet for the spaceliner application and for the globecruiser application. The technical issues needing further studies are identified.

TI Extremal rocket motion with maximum thrust in a linear central field
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Mayer variational problem of determining optimal trajectories of a rocket moving with maximum thrust in a thin spherical layer within a central Newtonian field is considered. The present work is devoted to the analytical investigation of maximum thrust arcs for a rocket engine with constant exhaust velocity and limited mass flow rate using the necessary conditions of optimality. Many problems of practical interest admit an approximation of the central Newtonian field by a linear central field. It is shown that the linear central field assumption is valid when the thrust vector is nearly tangential to the orbit and the rocket remains in a sufficiently thin spherical layer during the maneuver. When the linear central field approximation is utilized, analytic closed-form expressions are obtained describing optimal maximum thrust space trajectories. The problem of optimal orbit transfer between coplanar circular orbits is considered to illustrate the solution process, which comprises two maximum thrust and three null thrust arcs. It is shown that solutions of the problem are comparable with solutions based on assumptions of instantaneous changes in velocity, including the Hohmann transfer.

AB The predominant species in the plume residues resulting from the incomplete combustion of methylhydrazine (MMH)/N,N-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and N2O4 (NTO) in rocket engines are methylhydrazinium and N,N-dimethylhydrazinium nitrate. Both compounds were synthesized, characterized and their crystal structures were determined. The thermal, shock and friction sensitivity of these coma pounds was investigated. For both compounds the products formed in their thermal decompositions were determined.

AB The development of high-aspect-ratio, high-precision micromachining in silicon or silicon carbide suggests the feasibility of microfabricated, high-chamber-pressure chemical rocket engines. With high-speed turbopumps and valves incorporated onto the rocket chip, a number of propulsion cycles are possible, Such an engine, approximately 20 x 15 x 3 mm in size, operating at a 125-atm chamber pressure, would produce about 15 N of thrust using 300-s I-sp propellants at a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1000:1, The feasibility of these engines has been investigated, and a liquid-cooled, pressure-fed thrust chamber and nozzle have been successfully designed, fabricated, and operated at a 12.5-atm chamber pressure to further evaluate the concept.

AB Understanding the fundamentals of high-pressure, high-temperature combustion of practical rocket propellants is key to improving rocket engine performance and efficiency. The application of Raman spectroscopy for making detailed species concentration measurements of oxygen, hydrogen, and water vapor in the elevated-pressure, combusting flowfield downstream of a liquid-oxygen/gaseous-hydrogen swirl-coaxial injector element at fuel-rich conditions is presented. Details regarding measurement error analysis and recommendations fur further refinement of the diagnostic technique are also presented. To the authors' knowledge, these experiments represent the first time that instantaneous temperature and major species profiles have been successfully made in such an environment. These results, which include both instantaneous and time-averaged temperature and species concentration profiles, impact both rocket fuel preburner design and computational fluid dynamic code validation activities.

AB The mixing and combustion processes in a liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen rocket combustor were studied, The research focused on observations of atomization phenomena during steady-state combustion and ignition transients of a rocket engine. Cold-flow atomization as encountered before ignition has been studied using liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and simulation fluids liquid nitrogen/helium. The theoretical assessments show that for binary- and multicomponent systems a transcritical region exists where surface tension is present even at pressures above the critical pressure of one component as long as the critical mixing temperature is not exceeded. Also, hot-fire tests utilizing liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen demonstrate the strong influence of the dame on the atomization process. The dame propagation during ignition could be identified by the change of the atomization phenomenology before and during the ignition process.

AB In rocket engines propelled by liquid fuels and liquid oxidizers, one may find regions where two adjacent spray streams, one that carries fuel droplets and the other that carries the droplets of the liquid oxidizer, travel at different velocities and form a shear flow. A theoretical study of such unidirectional multisize (polydisperse) evaporating spray streams is presented. In each of the streams droplets of different sizes are assumed to travel at different longitudinal velocities, that is, drop-size correlated velocities are assumed for both the liquid fuel and the liquid oxidizer, The lateral evolution in drop-size distributions across the shear layer is analyzed, and its effect on the lateral spread of the fuel vapor and the vapors produced by the droplets of the liquid oxidizer is examined, It is shown that the polydisperse drop-size distributions of the liquid fuel as well as that of the liquid oxidizer control the vapor production rates and determine the shape of the vapor concentration profiles across the shear layer.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Tradeoffs involved in the design of a hydrocarbon-fueled, hypersonic waverider-based missile were explored. The problem of providing acceptable vehicle performance in a volume-constrained package was addressed. The specific case of a missile constrained to fit within a 0.61 x 0.61 x 4.27 in naval vertical launch tube was examined, and a parametric study was performed to determine the probabilistic boundaries of designing a Mach 6 missile to satisfy the desired mission goal of a 750-km cruising range. All missile designs were assumed to reach cruising altitude and velocity through the use of an external rocket booster. The key design elements investigated are fuel volume fraction, engine inlet pressure, the number of scramjet engines, and the effects of changing the engine mixing and burning efficiencies. Missile designs were optimized for steady-state trim conditions at the beginning of cruise using genetic algorithm software. The sensitivities of the modeling assumptions on the performance of the final optimized designs are explained. The overall contribution of the optimized designs along with the predicted change in performance expected with increased modeling accuracy allows upper performance and range limits to be established. Double-engine designs are shown to be more promising than single-engine designs for achieving the desired 750-km range, as well as allowing for increased payload.

AB We have identified three new tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor (TRAF) domain-containing proteins in humans using bioinformatics approaches, including: MUL, the product of the causative gene in Mulibrey Nanism syndrome; USP7 (HAUSP), an ubiquitin protease; and SPOP, a POZ domain-containing protein. Unlike classical TRAF family proteins involved in TNF family receptor (TNFR) signaling, the TRAF domains (TDs) of MUL, USP7, and SPOP are located near the NR, termini or central region of these proteins, rather than carboxyl end. MUL and USP7 are capable of binding in vitro via their TDs to all of the previously identified TRAF family proteins (TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, TRAF5, and TRAF6), whereas the TD of SPOP interacts weakly with TRAF1 and TRAF6 only. The TD of MUL also interacted with itself, whereas the TDs of USP7: and SPOP did not self-associate, Analysis of various MUL and USP7 mutants by transient transfection assays indicated that the TDs of these proteins are necessary and sufficient for suppressing NF-kappaB induction by TRAF2 and TRAF6 as well as certain TRAF-binding TNF family receptors. In contrast, the TIP of SPOP did not inhibit NF-kappaB induction. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy indicated that MUL localizes to cytosolic bodies, with targeting to these structures mediated by a RBCC tripartite domain within the MUL protein. USP7 localized predominantly to the nucleus, in a TD-dependent manner. Data base searches revealed multiple proteins containing TDs homologous to those found in MUL, USP7, and SPOP throughout eukaryotes, including yeast, protists, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, suggesting that this branch of the TD family arose from an ancient gene. We propose the moniker TEFs (TD-encompassing factors) for this large family of proteins.

AB The goal of life extending control (LEC) is to enhance structural durability of complex mechanical systems, such as aircraft, spacecraft, and energy conversion devices, without incurring any significant loss of performance. This paper presents a concept of robust life-extending controller design for reusable rocket engines, similar to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), via damage mitigation in both fuel and oxidiser turbines: while achieving the required performance for transient responses of the main combustion chamber pressure and the oxidant/fuel mixture ratio. The design procedure makes use of a combination of linear robust control synthesis and nonlinear optimisation techniques. Results of simulation experiments on the model of a reusable rocket engine are presented to this effect.

TI Accelerometer spiking under cryogenic conditions
SO EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS
LA English
DT Article
DE pyroelectric effect; piezoelectric accelerometer; cryogenic; rocket
   engine
AB Spurious transient outputs of a piezoelectric accelerometer have been observed when the accelerometer is attached to a surface undergoing rapid cool-down to a cryogenic temperature. Such conditions occur in cryogenic propellant rockets on assemblies such as feedlines and turbopumps. Under exposure to liquid oxygen, surface temperatures can drop to near -300 degreesF in a matter of minutes. The occurrence of spurious output depends on the internal construction of the accelerometer and on the effectiveness of thermal isolation provided by the mounting for a susceptible accelerometer. Specifically, an Endevco Model 2271AM20 charge-mode, compression-type accelerometer (CTA) has been observed to produce intermittent spurious output spikes during flight of a launch vehicle, during ground test firing of a rocket engine and in laboratory experiments. It is suggested that this spiking, also known as the pyroelectric effect, can be attributed to charge buildup due to thermal effects in the piezo-electric crystal stack. In the case studies, sporadic jumping of this charge across a gap at the outer edge of the plating on the crystal stack face is believed to cause momentary saturation of the charge amplifier. A replacement Endevco Model 7722 sheer-type accelerometer (STA) using a different type of crystal arrangement as well as a different crystal material proved to eliminate these spurious charge jumps in a series of laboratory tests. This paper presents the results of experiments conducted to evaluate both the CTA and the STA. The effectiveness of different mounting configurations, used to provide thermal isolation sufficient to eliminate the spikes from the CTA, was evaluated. It is also suggested that observations of a particular type of nonzero mean signal in the time domain and broad, elevated, low-frequency content in the frequency spectrum can be useful in detecting the presence of pyroelectric-induced transients, even if the spikes are visually buried within high-amplitude vibration data.

TI Safe testing of nuclear rockets
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB In the early 1960s, Werner Von Braun and others recognized the need for a nuclear rocket for sending humans to Mars. The great distances, the intense radiation levels, and the physiological response to zero gravity all support the concept of using a nuclear rocket to decrease mission time. These same needs have been recognized in later studies and, especially, in the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989. One of the key questions that has arisen in later studies, however, is the ability to test a nuclear rocket engine in the current societal environment. Unlike the Rover/Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications programs in the 1960s, the rocket exhaust can no longer be vented to the open atmosphere. As a consequence, previous studies have examined the feasibility of building a large-scale version of the Nuclear Furnace Scrubber that was demonstrated in 1971. We have investigated an alternative that would deposit the rocket exhaust along with any entrained fission products directly into the ground. The subsurface active filtering of exhaust concept would allow variable-sized engines to be tested for long times at a modest expense. A system overview, results of preliminary calculations, and current status of a proof-of-concept demonstration are presented.

AB Theoretical performance calculation is made of a scramjet propulsion system incorporating a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-energy-bypass scheme. The MHD generator upstream of the combustion chamber slows down the Row so that the Mach number at the entrance of the combustion chamber is kept below a specified value, The MHD accelerator downstream of the combustion chamber accelerates the Row, expending the electrical power produced by the generator. The Row is seeded with potassium or cesium, and the MHD devices operate as Faraday machines, Friction is neglected, and chemical equilibrium is assumed everywhere except in the nozzle downstream of the freezing point, The calculation shows that the MHD-bypass scheme can improve specific impulse over that of a conventional scramjet at Eight speeds over 3.5 km/s, At speeds below about 6 km/s, the calculated specific impulse fan be higher than that of a typical rocket engine, Consequently, the MHD-bypass scheme can extend the operational range or improve the performance of a conventional scramjet engine.

ID OXIDATION; MODEL
AB A one-formula surrogate fuel formulation and its quasi-global combustion kinetics model are developed to support the design of injectors and thrust chambers of kerosene-fueled rocket engines. This surrogate fuel model depicts a fuel blend that properly represents the general physical and chemical properties of kerosene. The accompanying gaseous-phase thermodynamics of the surrogate fuel is anchored with the heat of formation of kerosene and verified by comparing a series of one-dimensional rocket thrust chamber calculations. The quasi-global combustion kinetics model consists of several global steps for parent fuel decomposition, soot formation, and soot oxidation and a detailed wet-CO mechanism to complete the combustion process. The final thermophysics formulations are incorporated with a computational fluid dynamics model for prediction of the combustion efficiency of an unielement, tripropellant combustor and the radiation of a kerosene-fueled thruster plume. The model predictions agreed reasonably well with those of the tests.

ID FATIGUE; MECHANICS
AB Single crystal nickel base superalloy turbine blades are being utilized in rocket engine turbopumps and turbine engines because of their superior creep, stress rupture, melt resistance, and thermomechanical fatigue capabilities over polycrystalline alloys. High cycle fatigue induced failures in aircraft gas turbine and rocket engine turbopump blades is a pervasive problem. Blade attachment regions are prone to fretting fatigue failures. Single crystal nickel base superalloy turbine blades are especially prone to fretting damage because the subsurface shear stresses induced by fretting action at the attachment regions ran result in crystallographic initiation and crack growth along octahedral planes. This paper presents contact stress evaluation in the attachment region for single crystal turbine blades used in the NASA alternate advanced high pressure fuel turbo pump for the space shuttle main engine. Single crystal materials have highly anisotropic properties making the position of the crystal lattice relative to the part geometry a significant factor in the overall analysis. Blades and the attachment region are modeled using a large-scale three-dimensional finite element model capable of accounting for contact friction, material anisotropy, and variation in primary and secondary crystal orientation. Contact stress analysis in the blade attachment regions is presented as a function of coefficient of friction and primary and secondary crystal orientation, Fretting stresses at the attachment region are seen to vary significantly as a function of crystal orientation. The stress variation as a function of crystal orientation is a direct consequence of the elastic anisotropy of the material. Fatigue life calculations and fatigue failures are discussed for the airfoil and the blade attachment regions.

DE cryogeny; polymer; friction coefficient; wear rate; model
AB From a tribological point of view, the selection of materials for seals for valves of cryogenic rocket engines is a critical issue for the designer. Due to the lack of comprehensive information on this topic. data have been obtained in the framework of research programmes.
   In the first step, two polymers potentially usable for sealing cryogenic fluids were identified, They were submitted to general test conditions to gain some fundamental understanding of their tribological behaviour when immersed in a cryogenic fluid. This fundamental understanding proved to be helpful for an efficient technical approach.
   This approach with the test conditions as close as possible to those met in real valves has been used in the second step. In order to obtain the best information with the minimum number of tests, the statistical method of Doehlert has been adopted. The use of such a method led to the construction of surface response for modelling friction and wear. These surfaces and their associated equation are directly and easily usable by the designer, This way of treating technical tribological problem is illustrated by an example.

AB Consideration is being given to use the known long and short forecasts of development of rocket engines in past - at the beginning of development of a missile engineering (K. Tsiolkovsky etc. pioneers of rocket propulsion); on the eve of launching of the artificial satellite of Earth (A. Blagonravov); after manned flight of Yu. Gagarin (V. Gluchko); after manned flight on Moon (" The Forecasts on 2001 " on materials of readings R. Goddard in USA); in middle of 70-s' years (D. Sevruk, V. Prisniakov) and at the end of 20 centure. Last years under the initiative R. Beichel and M. Pouliquen IAA.Advanced Propulsion Working Group carries out large researches on definition of the tendencies of development of rocket propulsion for the next forty years, the outcomes which one will be used in the report. The comparison of development of rocket propulsion expected to the end of 20 century and real-life is given. The report analyses the errors of the forecasts of the past - the absence reliable prognostic procedure; the euphoria of the maiden successes of conquest of space; dominance of military and political- propaganda motives of implementation of the space programs before economical; to keep developments secret; competition of two super-powers USSR and USA etc. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID VIBRATION
AB A method for detecting anomalous gear behavior in rocket engine turbomachinery during acceptance hot firing is presented. The diagnostic procedure is based on a cepstrum analysis of steady-state gearbox accelerations. In this application, the cepstrum is defined as the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the log of the two-sided autospectral density, The vibration measurements used in the analysis are acquired during static hot fire tests from accelerometers mounted on the external surface of the turbopump gearbox. Following the ground tests, the cepstrum technique is used to provide insight into the differences between turbopumps that have functioned nominally and those with out-of-family signatures. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by comparing analysis results fmol an engine in good condition with a similar engine that suffered complete gear failure during its development test. This example is used to suggest that the cepstrum method cannot only help detect out-of-family vibration characteristics, but ran also pmr ide insight into the nature of a defect. A source mechanism is proposed to explain the unique spectral characteristics that appear due to the presence of the gear fault.

AB A new computer analysis tool capable of predicting rocket-based combined-cycle engine performance data (thrust and I-sp) over a wide range of flight conditions and engine operating modes is presented. The tool is called SCCREAM, which stands for simulated combined-cycle rocket engine analysis module, SCCREAM is an object-oriented workstation-level code written in C++ that ran be remotely executed through a web-based user interface. It uses quasi-one-dimensional flow analysis techniques, component and combustion efficiencies, and an inlet pressure recovery schedule as simplifying assumptions, SCCREAM was created for the conceptual launch vehicle design environment and is capable of quickly generating large tables of engine performance data for use in subsequent trajectory optimization. An overview of SCCREAM and the program logic is presented. Results from SCCREAM are compared with published rocket-based combined-cycle engine performance data and with data generated by other engine analysis tools for a representative reference vehicle configuration.

TI Response surface and neural network techniques for rocket engine
   injector optimization
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The response surface methodology for rocket engine injector design optimization for which only modest amounts of data may exist is examined. Two main aspects are emphasized: relative performance of quadratic and cubic polynomial response surfaces and enhancement of the fidelity of the response surface via neural networks. A data set of 45 design points from a semi-empirical model for a shear coaxial injector element using gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen propellants is used to formulate response surfaces using quadratic and cubic polynomials. This original data set is also employed to train a two-layered radial basis neural network (RBNN). The trained network is then used to generate additional data to augment the original information available to characterize the design space. Quadratic and cubic polynomials are again used to generate response surfaces for this RBNN-enhanced data set, The response surfaces resulting from both the original and RBNN-enhanced data sets are compared for accuracy. Whereas the cubic fit is superior to the quadratic fit for each data set, the RBNN-enhanced data set is capable of improving the accuracy of the response surface if noticeable errors from polynomial curve fits are encountered. Furthermore, the RBNN-enhanced data set yields more consistent selections of optimal designs between cubic and quadratic polynomials. The techniques de, eloped can be directly applied to injector design and optimization for rocket propulsion.

TI Producing scalable performance with OpenMP: Experiments with two CFD
   applications
SO PARALLEL COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE computational fluid dynamics; MPI; OpenMP; scalability
AB OpenMP is a relatively new programming paradigm, which can easily deliver good parallel performance for small numbers (<16) of processors. Success with more processors is more difficult to produce. MPI is a relatively mature programming paradigm, and there have been many reports of highly scalable MPI codes for large numbers (hundreds, even thousands) of processors. In this paper, we explore the causes of poor scalability with OpenMP from two points of view. First, we incrementally transform the loops in a combustion application until we achieve reasonably good parallel scalability, and chronicle the effect of each step. Then, we approach scalability from the other direction by transforming a highly scalable program simulating the core flow of a solid-fuel rocket engine (originally written with MPI calls) directly to OpenMP, and report the barriers to scalability that were detected. The list of incremental transformations includes well-known techniques such as loop interchange and loop fusion, plus new ones which make use of the unique features of OpenMP, such as barrier removal and the use of ordered serial loops. The list of barriers to scalability includes the use of the ALLOCATE statement within a parallel region, as well as the lack of a reduction clause for a PARALLEL region in OpenMP. We conclude with a list of key issues which need to be addressed to make OpenMP a more easily scalable paradigm. Some of these are OpenMP implementation issues; some are language issues. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of a laser-based combustion diagnostics system and its application to the analysis of a high-pressure rocket engine injector flowfield are described, One dimensionally spatially resolved (linewise), multispecies, single-pulse images are obtained with an imaging spectrograph/digital camera detection setup that images spontaneous vibrational Raman light scattering caused by a pulsed ultraviolet laser, used to enhance Raman signal strength by the inverse fourth power of laser wavelength scaling for Raman scattering cross sections. These images provide temporally and spatially resolved qualitative information about the presence of gaseous major species (water vapor and molecular hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen) during a hot-fire, high-pressure (6.04-MPa) test of a single-element liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen swirled injector operating at a high oxidizer/fuel mixture ratio (100) in a test article pressurized by a nitrogen coflow. Raman images, taken every 40 ms, are generally uncorrelated with respect to each other during the constant pressure, main-stage portion of the test, but occasionally temporally adjacent image pairs are correlated, suggesting large-scale motion in the dow, possibly from transverse movements of the reactant jet within the diluent coflow. Simultaneous measurements of major species show unburnt ignitor gas (hydrogen) during the startup transient and excess diluent (nitrogen) during the shutdown transient, along with significant variations in the oxygen/nitrogen ratio during the test. Stimulated Raman and ozone production problems are investigated.

TI Transient force reduction in electromechanical actuators for
   thrust-vector control
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a move within the aerospace community to use electromechanical actuators (EMA) in thrust-vector control (TVC) applications. However, shock-wave forces that occur during startup and shutdown of unthrottled TVC rocket engines excite resonance in the mechanical dynamics, This results in very large forces transmitted through the actuator. Additionally, with traditional compensation, the position control system must be designed with low bandwidth because of the typically low resonant frequency. Dynamic force feedback (DFF) compensation is proposed to reduce the effects of resonance, Utilizing a motor position sensor and a load cell in the actuator mount, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) position control loop is closed in parallel with a Force control loop to provide resonance reduction and transmitted force reduction. This allows higher position control bandwidths while reducing the transmitted forces. The controller design methodology uses two independent loop-shaping procedures, which are separated by their effective frequency ranges. The techniques are validated with experimental data from an EMA-TVC simulator, showing improvements in both the position control and the transmitted forces. Additionally, the controller is shown to be robust with respect to variation in the resonance.

AB A fully reusable rocket vehicle is proposed to demonstrate good operability characteristics both un the ground and in flight. For achieving technical readiness for future space transportation systems, design considerations not only for higher-performance-related issues but also those for good operability are needed. The proposed vehicle is to be used as a sounding rocket and has the capabilities of ballistic flight, returning to the launch site, and landing vertically, making use of clustered liquid-hydrogen rocket engines. Before the development of this type of reusable rocket was initiated, a small test vehicle with a liquid-hydrogen rocket engine was built and flight tested. A demonstration of vertical landing and exercise of turnaround operation for repeated flights are the major objectives of the test vehicle. Two flights were performed in succession, and the flight-test operation provided many valuable experiences for designing the fully reusable rocket vehicle.

DT Article
ID GENERALIZED THERMOELASTICITY; INFINITE BODY; PULSE
AB The problem of dynamic thermoelastic stresses in a spherical shell with fixed boundaries whose inner surface is subjected to a step jump in temperature is considered. The analysis is carried out in the uncoupled framework under the classical Lord and Shulman (1967) and Green and Lindsay (1972) formulations of thermoelasticity. Exact solutions for the temperature and displacement equations are obtained using the Laplace transform and eigenfunction expansion method, respectively. Of particular interest is the propagation and nature of discontinuities in the temperature, displacement, and stress fields that are possible under the two nonclassical theor ies. Exact expressions for the magnitudes of discontinuities in these quantities are also given, and shock waves are noted Numerical results are presented graphically along with a comparison of the three models. In addition, special and limiting cases of the physical parameters are investigated and the application of this research to fuel vessels used in rocket engine testing are noted. Lastly, a discussion concerning which of the three theories is the most physically acceptable is given, with the Lord and Shulman formulation emerging as the clear overall choice, and conclusions are stated.

AB Inflow species concentration measurements in reacting flows at high pressures, based on nonintrusive methods, have been acquired so far for isolated conditions in a range of experimental devices and by using a variety of methods. Furthermore, extensive assessments of the uncertainties associated with the measurement techniques are lacking. In general, these methods have been based on calibrations determined from assumptions that were not sufficiently quantified to provide a detailed range of the uncertainties associated with these measurements. This work quantifies the uncertainties associated with OH measurement in an oxygen-hydrogen system produced by a shear, coaxial injector typical of those used in rocket engines. Planar OH distributions are obtained for a range of pressures from 10 to 53 bar, providing instantaneous and averaged distribution in a unified study, using the same experimental setup and maintaining the rest of the parameters the same. The uncertainty of 18 different parameters was evaluated and the overall root mean square error was found as 21.9, 22.8, 22.5, and 22.9% at 10, 27, 37, and 53 bar, respectively.

TI Effect of Chamber Backpressure on Swirl Injector Fluid Mechanics
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

DT Article
AB Fluid mechanics of a liquid swirl injector element at various chamber backpressures were investigated. The center-jet swirling element was designed using typical liquid propellant rocket engine parameters, then manufactured and tested in a high-pressure, optically accessible, cold flow facility. Water was injected into a chamber pressurized with gaseous nitrogen at a constant swirl injector How rate of 0.09 kg/s. The chamber backpressure ranged from 0.10 to 4.81 MPa. The film thickness and spray angle near the nozzle exit were measured by shadowgraphy. The film thickness was also measured within the injector upstream of the exit through a transparent nozzle tube section. Increasing the chamber backpressure for this fixed mass How rate increased the film thickness from predicted design values. Measured discharge coefficient values increased with increasing chamber backpressure, reflecting the observed increase in internal nozzle film thickness. The spray angle decreased for increasing chamber backpressure.

AB The heat transfer characteristics of China no. 3 kerosene were investigated experimentally and analytically under conditions relevant to a regenerative cooling system for scramjet applications. A test facility developed for the present study can handle kerosene in a temperature range of 300-1000 K, a pressure range of 2.6-5 MPa, and a mass How rate range of 10-100 g/s. In addition, the test section was uniquely designed such that both the wall temperature and the bulk fuel temperature were measured at the same location along the flowpath. The measured temperature distributions were then used to analytically deduce the local heat transfer characteristics. A 10-component kerosene surrogate was proposed and employed to calculate the fuel thermodynamic and transport properties that were required in the heat transfer analysis. Results revealed drastic changes in the fuel flow properties and heat transfer characteristics when kerosene approached its critical state. Convective heat transfer enhancement was also found as kerosene became supercritical. The heat transfer correlation in the relatively low-fuel-temperature region yielded a similar result to other commonly used jet fuels, such as JP-7 and JP-8, at compressed liquid states. In the high-fuel-temperature region, near and beyond the critical temperature, heat transfer enhancement was observed; hence, the associated correlation showed a more significant Reynolds number dependency.

AB In the case of high overexpansion, the exhaust jet of the supersonic nozzle of rocket engines separates from nozzle wall because of the large adverse pressure gradient. Correspondingly, to match the pressure of the separated flow region, an oblique shock is generated which evolves through the supersonic jet starting approximately at the separation point. This shock reflects on the nozzle axis with a Mach reflection. Thus, a peculiar Mach reflection takes place whose features depend on the upstream flow conditions, which are usually not uniform. The expected features of Mach reflection may become much difficult to predict, depending on the nozzle shape and the position of the separation point along the divergent section of the nozzle.

AB The control of ignition in a rocket engine is a critical problem for combustion chamber design. Delayed ignition may lead to high-amplitude pressure fluctuations that can damage the burner (strong ignition), whereas early ignition may fail. This paper describes a numerical study of a strong ignition sequence observed in a laboratory-scale single-injector rocket chamber ignited by a laser and fueled with gaseous oxygen and hydrogen. OH-emission images, Schlieren pictures, and pressure measurements make it possible to follow the flame propagation experimentally. The present large eddy simulation (LES) approach includes shock treatment, a six species-seven reaction chemical scheme for H-2-O-2, and a model for the energy deposition by a laser. Flame/turbulence interaction is modeled with the thickened flame concept. LES is used to compute both the filling phase (during which the gaseous hydrogen and oxygen mix) and the ignition phase. The flame location and structure, as well as the temporal evolution of the chamber pressure obtained numerically, are in good agreement with the experiment. The use of complex chemistry in the computation also allows the comparison of LES data with experimental OH-images and shows that the sensitivity of the CCD camera used to record the spontaneous emission of the OH* radical is not high enough to property locate the flame front in rich regions. The combined experimental and numerical results lead to a more detailed analysis of the ignition processes and its coupling with flow rate oscillations in the H-2 and O-2 feeding lines.

AB High frequency combustion instabilities have technical importance in the design of liquid rocket engines. These phenomena involve a strong coupling between transverse acoustic modes and combustion. They are currently being investigated by combining experimentation and numerical simulations. On the experimental level, the coupling is examined in a model scale system featuring a multiple injector combustor (MIC) comprising five coaxial injectors fed with liquid oxygen and gaseous methane. This system is equipped with a novel VHAM actuator (Very High Amplitude Modulator) which comprises two nozzles and a rotating toothed wheel blocking the nozzles in an alternate fashion. This device was designed to obtain the highest possible levels of transverse oscillation in the MIC. After a brief review of the VHAM, this article reports cold flow experiments using this modulator. Velocity maps obtained under resonant conditions using the VHAM are examined at different instants during a cycle of oscillation. Experimental data are compared with numerical pressure and velocity fields obtained from an acoustic solver. The good agreement observed in the nozzle vicinity indicates that numerical simulations can be used to analyze the complex flow field generated by the VHAM. To cite this article: Y. Mery et al., C.

AB This paper presents the results of the first DEIMOS Liquid Methane/Oxygen rocket engine test campaign. DEIMOS is an acronym for 'Delft Experimental Methane Oxygen propulsion System'. It is a project performed by students under the auspices of DARE (Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering). The engine provides a theoretical design thrust of 1800 N and specific impulse of 287 s at a chamber pressure of 40 bar with a total mass flow of 637 g/s. It has links to sustainable development, as the propellants used are one of the most promising so-called 'green propellants'-combinations, currently under scrutiny by the industry, and the engine is designed to be reusable. This paper reports results from the provisional tests, which had the aim of verifying the engine's ability to fire, and confirming some of the design assumptions to give confidence for further engine designs. Measurements before and after the tests are used to determine first estimates on feed pressures, propellant mass flows and achieved thrust. These results were rather disappointing from a performance point of view, with an average thrust of a mere 3.8% of the design thrust, but nonetheless were very helpful. The reliability of ignition and stability of combustion are discussed as well. An initial assessment as to the reusability, the flexibility and the adaptability of the engine was made. The data provides insight into (methane/oxygen) engine designs, leading to new ideas for a subsequent design. The ultimate goal of this project is to have all operational rocket and to attempt to set all amateur altitude record.

AB A detailed computational analysis of the oxidizer preflow during startup of a storable propellant upper-stage rocket engine is presented. This low-pressure flow regime is controlled by various two-phase phenomena, particularly flash atomization and flash evaporation of superheated liquid oxidizer, leading to a significant temperature drop in the combustion chamber. To account for these phenomena, physical models are extended to low-pressure conditions and implemented into the framework of an iterative Euler-Lagrange method. A new semi-implicit concept of the spray source term linearization is employed, improving the robustness of the numerical solution procedure by accounting for intense coupling of vapor flow and spray. Following the analysis of the three-dimensional two-phase flowfield and spray deposit distribution in the combustion chamber and nozzle extension, the influence of liquid injection temperature and initial droplet size distribution is investigated by detailed parametric studies. The results indicate a particular importance of the spray-wall interaction and secondary-droplet breakup for the coarser sprays and a bimodal deposit distribution on the chamber walls. Computational results agree well with experimental data and are used to derive transfer functions describing global preflow dynamics on a system level.

AB Effect of reduced gravity on heat transfer and rewetting temperature during quenching: application to rocket engines reignition. This paper describes the experimental strategy developed to improve the modeling of liquid-vapor flows during the chill down of rocket engines by cryogenic fluid in microgravity. A similarity analysis is performed to determine the relevant dimensionless numbers for the design of an experiment similar to engine flows. A literature review on reduced gravity quenching experiments, and on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer shows the lack of validated models for microgravity. Experimental results obtained with the quenching of a glass tube by FC72 during parabolic flight are presented. Especially the impact of gravity and subcooling on rewetting temperature and film boiling heat transfer is investigated. Results show an increase in rewetting temperature, and a decrease in film boiling heat transfer tinder reduced gravity in agreement with the literature. The comparison of 0g flow pattern with corresponding tests on ground point out a behavior at 0g closer to 1g upflow than 1g downflow.

DE Heat exchangers; precoolers; combined cycle engines; SABRE engine
AB Combined cycle engines employing both pre-cooled air-breathing and rocket modes of operation are the most promising propulsion system for achieving single stage to orbit vehicles. The air-breathing phase is purely for augmentation of the mission velocity required in the rocket phase and as such must be mass effective, re-using the components of the rocket cycle, whilst achieving adequate specific impulse. This paper explains how the unique demands placed on the air-breathing cycle results in the need for sophisticated thermodynamics and the use of a series of different heat exchangers to enable precooling and high pressure ratio compression of the air for delivery to the rocket combustion chambers. These major heat exchanger roles are; extracting heat from incoming air in the precooler, topping up cycle flow temperatures to maintain constant turbine operating conditions and extracting rejected heat from the power cycle via regenerator loops for thermal capacity matching. The design solutions of these heat exchangers are discussed.

AB Among the refractory metals and alloys, niobium and niobium alloys are used in variety of high temperature applications ranging from light bulbs to rocket engines because of its high melting and boiling point, lower density, good ductility at room temperature and high corrosion resistance. In this paper the effects of different thermomechanical processing on structure and mechanical properties of electron beam melted niobium ingot was investigated. The correlation among the different processing conditions and microstructure as well as mechanical properties have been investigated using optical microscope, SEM, UTM and microhardness testing. The results show that the cold forging response of EB melted ingot was very poor, where as oxidation resistant coated ingot and ingot sealed in evacuated stainless steel jacket were successfully forged at 900 degrees C. The cast and hot forged EBM niobium ingot was cold rolled without any intermediate annealing. The hot forged, cold rolled and annealed niobium sheets exhibit better strength as compared to cold rolled and annealed niobium sheets. The mechanical properties of all the niobium sheets processed by using different processing conditions are superior to the properties specified by ASTM standard.

AB The ablation of pierced C/C composite nozzles was investigated via hot-fire testing by an oxygen/ethanol combustion gas generator simulating combustion environments of the liquid rocket engine. Ablation microstructures and mechanisms of the composite nozzle were discussed. The results showed that both linear ablation rate and mass ablation rate increased with increasing mass ratio of oxygen/ethanol. The ablation of the pierced C/C composite was attributed to the heterogeneous reactions between carbon and oxidizing species and could be interpreted by the thermochemical ablation model. The ablation rate of the composite was determined by both chemical kinetics and diffusion. The ablation of the composite resulted in cone-shape carbon fibers and shell-shape matrix with pits and grooves left on the surfaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Flow instability due to cryogenic cavitation in the downstream of

SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Cryogenic fluid; Cavitation; Flow instability; Orifice
AB Flow instability in LRE (liquid rocket engine) occurs due to various reasons such as flow interactions with valve, orifice and venturi, etc. The inception of cavitation, especially in the propellant feeding system, is the primary cause of mass and pressure oscillations because of the cyclic formation and depletion of cavitation. Meanwhile, the main propellant in a liquid rocket engine is the cryogenic fluid, which properties are very sensitive to temperature variation. And the change of propellant properties to temperature variation by thermodynamic effect needs to be properly taken into account in the flow analysis in order to understand basic mechanisms for cryogenic cavitation. The present study focuses on the formation of cryogenic cavitation by using the IDM model suggested by Shyy and coworkers. The flow instability was also numerically investigated in the downstream of orifice with a developed numerical code. Calculation results show that cryogenic cavitation can be a primary source of flow instability, leading to mass fluctuations accompanied by pressure oscillations. The prediction of cavitation in cryogenic fluid is of vital importance in designing a feeding system of an LRE.

AB The effect or baffle gaps on the damping enhancement of a liquid rocket engine combustor has been elucidated through a series of tests, which include cold acoustic tests under both atmospheric and simulated viscous conditions and simulated combustion tests. The injector-formed baffles, which consist of an array of protruded coaxial injectors, were round to have a much greater acoustic damping effect than conventional planar baffles. For several axial baffle lengths, an optimal acoustic damping capacitance has been achieved at a 0.1 similar to 0.2 mm baffle gap. The reason there exists an optimal baffle gap is thought to be mainly due to the viscous dissipation at the surface of the injector-formed baffles. Consequently, the axial baffle length can be reduced by taking advantage of the optimal baffle gap, providing a possible solution to the thermal cooling problem persistent with the baffle. Moreover, these optimum characteristics call provide sonic guidelines for manufacturing and assembling of the baffled Injectors in rocket combustors.

AB Despite recent progress, the complex geometry of rocket engine combustion chambers with several hundreds of injectors and the multifaceted physical processes involved in supercritical conditions still remain difficult to handle by using direct numerical simulation or even large eddy simulation methodologies. Accordingly, with a target of performing the simulation of practical configurations, a hierarchy of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes closures is developed and studied herein. Following the conclusions of previous experimental investigations, including supercritical conditions, mixing, and subsequent chemical reaction between LOx and GH2, the modeling proposals rely on the infinitely-fast-chemistry hypothesis. Within this framework, special care is required to model the turbulent mixing phenomena because they control the whole combustion process. In the supercritical Conditions under consideration, turbulent mixing processes are expected to lie between 1) mixing in gaseous conditions (because surface-tension effects and latent heat of vaporization do not hold above the critical point) and 2) mixing between a gas phase and a liquid phase (because the density variations are very important and are comparable with those encountered in two-phase flows). Three different modeling proposals to represent these specific features associated with supercritical mixing are applied to the calculation of a reference cryogenic turbulent jet flame.

AB A stabilizer that maintains a steady propellant mixture ratio in a liquid bipropellant rocket engine was introduced. First, a design criterion for the ideal performance of a general stabilizer was derived. A new stabilizer with bellows (bellows-type stabilizer) was proposed in the present study and relevant design parameters were identified by a mathematical model as well as a theoretical analysis. Governing equations were established to predict the static behaviour of the stabilizer. A bellows-type stabilizer was fabricated and its performance was measured. The performance predicted by the mathematical model showed satisfactory agreement with measurements and this validates the adequacy of the mathematical model proposed in the present study.

AB A new quasi-one-dimensional procedure (one-dimensional with area change) is presented for the transient solution of real-fluid flows in lines and volumes including heat transfer effects. The solver will be integrated into a larger suite of software modules developed for simulating rocket engines and propulsion systems. The solution procedure is coupled with a state-of-the-art real-fluid property database so that both compressible and incompressible fluids may be considered using the same procedure. The numerical techniques used in this procedure are described. Test cases modeling transient flow of nitrogen, water, and hydrogen are presented to demonstrate the capability of the current technique.

TI Self-pulsation characteristics of a gas-liquid swirl coaxial injector
SO ATOMIZATION AND SPRAYS
LA English
DT Article
ID ROCKET ENGINE; ATOMIZATION
AB Self-pulsation usually occurs in the gas-liquid swirl coaxial injector of a liquid rocket engine and it is accompanied by an intense scream. When self-pulsation occurs, pressure and flow rate oscillations are detected by the strong interactions between the liquid and gas phases. Because this oscillation can amplify combustion instabilities in liquid rocket, self-pulsation must be suppressed. Considerable research has been performed on self-pulsation characteristics, but the mechanism of self-pulsation has not been clarified. The main objective of this research is to understand the mechanism of self-pulsation. Toward this objective, the acoustic and spray characteristics of self-pulsation spray were investigated using the acoustic device and laser system; the dominant frequency of the liquid sheet was also measured. It was found that the frequencies of the scream and the spray oscillation are linearly proportional to the liquid and gas axial Reynolds number, and the self-pulsation frequency is determined by the unstable wave of the liquid sheet. Therefore it is concluded that self-pulsation occurs due to the dominant wave of the liquid sheet.

ID LASER-BASED MEASUREMENTS; PROPANE JETS; ATOMIZATION
AB Experiments were carried out to obtain spray drop velocity and size measurements when high-pressure fluid is injected into near-vacuum conditions typically observed downstream front rocket engine injectors and venting devices of the upper stages of spacecraft. Three different liquids representative for spacecraft propellants are investigated for injection at or near flashing conditions. Up to three typical injector geometries are evaluated at different pressure ratios and flow rates. The results show how flash atomization in vacuum conditions modifies the spray pattern, increases droplet velocities, and decreases their size compared with nonflashing conditions. From these results, several drop size and velocity correlations were established for the different injectors according to injection velocity and superheat level.

DT Article
ID SIMULATION; TURBULENCE; CLOSURE; CFD
AB Atomization is a phenomenon of high importance for many practical devices where it is expedient to increase the contact surface between a liquid and a surrounding gas. One of them is the agricultural sprayer used for crop protection. Improper spray characteristics can result in the loss of chemicals to the ground or to the air In order to reduce environmental impacts, the present study investigates the atomization of a liquid sheet issued from a hollow-cone nozzle used for pesticide spraying. Our model is based on an Eulerian approach and describes the flow inside the nozzle and the spray droplet characteristics just outside the nozzle. We use the same set of constants as in automotive and rocket engine fields. The results in terms of liquid dispersion and mean droplet size are in good agreement with experimental data, provided that the Reynolds stress model is used for the turbulence.

AB Mitsugumin 53 (MG53) is a muscle-specific RBCC/TRIM family member predominantly localized on small vesicles underneath the plasma membrane. Upon cell-surface lesion MG53 recruits the vesicles to the repair site in an oxidation-dependent manner and MG53-knockout mice develop progressive myopathy associated with defective membrane repair. In this report, we focus on MG53-knockout cardiomyocytes showing abnormal action potential profile and a reduced K+ current density. In cDNA expression experiments using cultured cells, K(V)2.1-mediated currents were remarkably increased by MG53 without affecting the total and cell-surface levels of channel expression. In imaging analysis MG53 seemed to facilitate the mobility of K(V)2.1-containing endocytic vesicles with acidic pH. However, similar effects on the current density and vesicular mobility were not observed in the putative dominant-negative form of MG53. Our data suggest that MG53 is involved in a constitutive cycle of certain cell-surface proteins between the plasma membrane and endosome-like vesicles in striated muscle, and also imply that the vesicular dynamics are essential for the quality control of K(V)2.1 in cardiomyocytes.

DT Article

AB A series of experiments was carried out on a pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE) running on a liquid kerosene-oxygen mixture to investigate the indirect detonation initiation. The experiments investigating the effect of Shchelkin spiral on the deflagrationto-detonation transition (DDT) process demonstrated that all spirals were able to enhance flame acceleration to some extent, but successful DDT was achieved only when the length of spiral was increased to six times of the inner diameter of detonation tube (6D). For the model with the spiral length of 6D, the DDT run-up distance was about 0.5m (10D) and the sum of ignition delay and DDT run-up time was around 0.6 ms, which only occupied 0.6% of the whole cycle (100 ms). It implied that ignition delay and DDT run-up time were not the key factors of limiting the increase of frequency in a kerosene/oxygen PDRE. In addition, an experiment on detonation initiation by a flame jet through an orifice plate was successfully conducted on the multi-cycle PDRE. For detonation tubes with the orifice plate mounted 10 cm and 20 cm away from the thrust wall, the DDT run-up distance obtained was approximately 0.30m (6D) and 0.2m (4D). Compared with the spiral configuration, the DDT run-up distance was shortened by 40% and 60% in the two cases, respectively. The results implied that a rapid initiation of detonation could be achieved in a shorter distance with the approach of the flame jet ignition.

AB The ablation properties of a three-dimensional carbon/silicon carbide composite nozzle were investigated via hot-fire testing by an ethanol/oxygen combustion gas generator simulating combustion environments of the liquid rocket engine. The linear ablation rate at the nozzle throat was 0.250 +/- 0.023 mm/s, and the overall mass ablation rate was 0.246 kg/(m(2) s). The ablation in the divergent section, convergent section, and in the regions near the throat grew severe by degree. Ablation mechanisms of the composite nozzle were predominated by the oxidation of the composite, and volatilization of the silica scale derived from oxidation of silicon carbide resulted in further ablation of the nozzle.

AB The paper describes the design and manufacturing of a gaseous propel I ant rocket engine. It is an undertaking of the authors, performed on project basis with fellow aerospace engineering Students under auspices of DARE (Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering). This paper describes the requirements, the engine development, and the design considerations and calculations as they were performed. Furthermore, the plans for engine tests and the parameters that will have to be measured during those tests are covered. The design process converged to a 1800 N thrust gaseous oxygen/methane (GOX/CH(4)) engine made of electrolytic copper. GOX/CH(4) was selected based oil its relatively high specific impulse, its availability and because of its potential as a green propellant. A test engine was produced with a specific impulse of 297 s and a propellant mass flow of 637 g/s. From a point of view of strength, the focus was mainly on robustness rather than light weight. The main aim now is to perform tests with the current engine, based oil which the performance can be verified and vital information for future design efforts can be acquired. The ultimate goal is to have an operational rocket and to attempt an amateur altitude record.

ID NOVELTY DETECTION; SUPPORT
AB This article describes the results of applying four unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to data from two rocket propulsion testbeds. The first testbed uses historical data from the Space Shuttle Main Engine. The second testbed uses data from an experimental rocket engine test stand located at NASA Stennis Space Center. The article describes nine anomalies detected by the four algorithms. The four algorithms use four different definitions of anomalousness. Orca uses a nearest-neighbor approach, defining a point to be an anomaly if its nearest neighbors in the data space are far away from it. The Inductive Monitoring System clusters the training data, and then uses the distance to the nearest cluster as its measure of anomalousness. GritBot learns rules from the training data, and then classifies points as anomalous if they violate these rules. One-class support vector machines map the data into a high-dimensional space in which most of the normal points are on one side of a hyperplane, and then classify points on the other side of the hyperplane as anomalous. Because of these different definitions of anomalousness, different algorithms detect different anomalies. We therefore conclude that it is useful to use multiple algorithms.

AB An approach to optimizing interplanetary trajectories of space vehicles with bi-modal nuclear rocket engines is proposed. Such trajectories are formed by combining the paths of small and large traction. The problem of optimizing an interplanetary flight is considered, using the modified method of spheres of influence. While calculating the boost path the finiteness of the engine traction is taken into account. Optimization of the paths of a small traction is performed by the transporting trajectory method. Optimal control is studied by means of the Pontryagin maximum principle for systems with the discontinuous right-hand side and alteration of the phase space. The analysis of the effectiveness of reducing fuel consumption on large traction planetocentric paths owing to the use of small traction on heliocentric paths, is given.

AB Flame stabilization in the near-injector region of a subscale liquid propellant rocket combustion chamber has been investigated using optical diagnostics. Several different single shear coaxial injectors have been used to inject liquid oxygen (LOX) and methane at relevant operating conditions. Three main operating points cover the range of sub-, near-, and supercritical conditions with respect to the thermodynamic critical point of oxygen. Whereas liquid oxygen has been injected at typical temperatures of about 120 K, gaseous methane was injected at near-ambient temperatures of about 270 K. Similar to previous investigations performed with LOX/H(2) combustion, spontaneous OH chemiluminescence has been detected to characterize the flame anchoring zone near the LOX post tip. Theoretical considerations have indicated that the binary mixture of oxygen and methane shows an entirely different behavior compared with the oxygen/hydrogen system. This is believed to have an influence on the spray evolution and mixing characteristics at supercritical conditions. The experimental investigation includes both the ignition transient as well as the steady-state operating points. It has been detected that the LOX/CH(4) flame shows very similar characteristics in comparison with a LOX/H(2) flame at similar operating conditions. Critical flame stabilization at the startup transient has been found during all hot runs. At steady-state conditions, the influence of the injection parameters on the flame shape is comparable to previous LOX/hydrogen investigations.

AB The global flow characteristics of the cryogenic flow injected from a single-element coaxial injector have been examined experimentally to simulate the flow and mixing behavior before ignition and combustion in characteristic rocket engines. The injector simulated one element of the cryogenic rocket engine injectors under realistic operating conditions. This work focuses specifically on the evolution of liquid nitrogen jet instability, spreading, and its atomization and mixing with the surrounding coaxial gaseous jet under steady-state atmospheric conditions. The effect of some important How parameters, such as velocity ratio and momentum ratio between jets, on the potential core length of the liquid nitrogen jet and shear angle of the flow have been analyzed. The results showed a significant role of these parameters on the instability and breakup of the liquid nitrogen jet, along with the strong heat transfer effect of the surrounding atmosphere on the cryogenic liquid nitrogen jet. The shear angle of the How remained constant along the longitudinal axis of the injector, thus confirming fully developed steady-state jet under atmospheric conditions. The mean value of the shear angle showed the transcritical nature of the liquid nitrogen jet under atmospheric conditions. The shear angle of the flow also reduced with introduction of the helium jet and decreased uniformly with increase in helium jet velocity, which supports the effect of surrounding gas density on the jet spreading as predicted by previous researchers. The potential core length of the cryogenic liquid nitrogen showed a local peak as a function of velocity of the gaseous jet and decreased exponentially with momentum ratio for values close to and higher than one.

AB A pulse detonation engine can be operated even if there are no compression mechanisms such as compressors or pistons, and a rocket engine with an extremely low combustor fill pressure (pulse detonation rocket) thus becomes possible. In this research, we made a model pulse-detonation-rocket system with increased specific impulse by partial fill. The performance predicted by this model was then confirmed experimentally. The thrust can be calculated by using the simplified pulse-detonation-engine model of Endo et al. [Endo, T., Kasahara, J., Matsuo, A., Inaba, K., Sato, S., and Fujiwara, T., "Pressure History at the Thrust Wall of a Simplified Pulse Detonation Engine," AIAA Journal, Vol. 42, No. 9, 2004, pp. 1921-1929] and the partial-filling-effect models of Sato et al. [Sato, S., Matsuo, A., Endo, T., and Kasahara, J., "Numerical Studies on Specific Impulse of Partially Filled Pulse Detonation Rocket Engines," Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2006, pp. 64-69]. The mass flow rate of the propellant supplied from the pressurized cylinders is considered in this calculation. As a result, the thrust performance can be determined by the kind of propellant, the initial conditions of the gas in the cylinders, the supply-valve-orifice and pulse-detonation-engine-tube volume, and the operation frequencies. We fabricated a pulse detonation rocket named Todoroki and verified the thrust calculation model via a horizontal sliding test. We confirmed that the stability of the pulse-detonation-engine operation depends on the ratio between the purge-gas thickness and the tube diameter. The thrust predicted by the model was identical to experimental results within 4%.

AB Scramjet engines promise significantly higher specific impulse than rockets during the hypersonic phase if low-Earth-orbit insertion trajectories. Despite this, scramjets are not used on any current systems due to the difficulty of operating over the large Mach number envelope required by this accelerating trajectory. The key to taking advantage of airbreathing hypersonic engines for low-Earth-orbit insertion is to develop a multistage system that makes use of the scramjet only within its high-performance regime. A multistage rocket-scramjet-rocket system that accepts this limitation has therefore been examined. This system Includes a solid rocket boost to Mach 6, a near-term Mach 6-12 hydrogen-fueled scramjet engine to propel a reusable second stage, and a liquid-fueled final-stage rocket. Trajectory calculations for a system scaled In deliver approximately 100 log to a 200 km equatorial orbit indicate payload mass fractions of approximately 1.5 % with the use of a scramjet stage designed for low drag and efficient packaging. The goal of this work is to guide the future development of scramjets by identifying the areas that will make the most significant improvement to their use for space access.

AB Film cooling is widely used in conventional gas turbine and rocket engines to minimize thermal loading of engine structures and to manage heat transfer between hot, reacting gases and cooler structural components. Previous experimental work has shown that streamwise pressure gradients strongly influence the performance of the film. This paper extends semi-empirical modeling ideas for wall-jet film cooling to include the effects of adverse and favorable pressure gradients. The extended model shows that a pressure gradient's effect on cooling performance depends on whether the velocity of the film is greater than the core flow (a wall-jet film) or less than the core (a core-driven film). In wall-jet films, a favorable pressure gradient improves cooling performance by increasing the thickness and persistence of the film. Conversely, in core-driven films, a favorable pressure gradient reduces the persistence and thickness of the film leading to reduced cooling performance. Under isobaric conditions, the extended model results match experimental measurements within 2.5% in the near-slot region. When pressure gradients are present, the extended model matches experimental data to within 15% in the near-slot region and correctly predicts experimentally observed trends.

AB This article considers the influence of fluctuations in temperature on acoustic resonance characteristics of a combustion chamber. This analysis is concerned With acoustic coupling experienced in high frequency instabilities. Experiments carried out on a Multiple injector combustor (MIC) operating Willi liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are used to simulate oil a model scale the situation prevailing in a liquid rocket thrust chamber. External acoustic modulations are generated by periodically blocking an auxiliary nozzle Willi a rotating toothed wheel. By continuously changing the rotation velocity, it is possible to apply a linear frequency sweep and obtain the response of the system to all external excitation. It is found that the chamber quality factor under hot fire conditions is reduced with respect to the one measured under cold flow conditions. This is shown to be correlated With the level and spatial extension of temperature fluctuations inside the chamber. Temperature fluctuations induce variations in the speed of sound Which in turn Perturb the eigenfrequencies of the system and modify its response. This effect is modeled in a simplified way by considering a second order dynamical system featuring an eigenfrequency which fluctuates around its mean value. The dynamics is analyzed by making use of simulations and by the method of averaging. It is shown that when the eigenfrequency fluctuates, the system behaves as if it had an augmented level of dissipation and that this induces a reduction in the quality factor. It is concluded that this mechanism could have an important impact on the development of oscillations in liquid rocket engines. (C) 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The characteristics of propellant injection, mixing, and combustion have a profound effect on liquid rocket engine performance. The necessity of raising rocket engines performance requires a combustion chamber operation often in a supercritical regime. A supercritical combustion model based on a one-phase multi-components approach is developed and tested on a non-premixed H-2-O-2 flame configuration. A two equations turbulence model is used for describing the jet dynamics where a limited Pope correction is added to account for the oxidant spreading rate. Transport properties of the mixture are calculated using extended high pressure forms of the mixing rules. An equilibrium chemistry scheme is adopted in this combustion case, with both algebraic and stochastic expressions for the chemistry/turbulence coupling. The model was incorporated into a computational fluid dynamics commercial code (Fluent 6.2.16). The validity of the present model was investigated by comparing predictions of temperature, species mass fractions, recirculation zones and visible flame length to the experimental data measured on the Mascotte test rig. The results were confronted also with advanced code simulations. It appears that the agreement between the results was fairly good in the chamber regions situated downstream the near injection zone.

AB Elements of the liquid-propellant rocket engines (LPREs) are subject to the action of intense mechanical and thermal loads, which are temporally related to the start-up, normal regime, and switch-off periods of the working cycle. Recoverable LPREs experience these loads many times. Repeated (cyclic) loads lead to the manifestation of processes typical of fatigue, whereby residual stresses and (plastic) deformations are retained and accumulated in the LPRE materials. Numerical investigations using models of the nonstationary thermal and stressed-strained state and the plastic behavior of materials have been performed in order to determine the limiting numbers of loading cycles for the structural materials employed in various units of LPREs. A special computational-experimental procedure is described, which allows these materials to be studied in a stressed-strained state close to that in real LPREs.

AB Some new types of heat-resistant coatings developed at present were tested for thermal fluxes and temperatures implemented in flame channels of modern rocket engines. The megawatt three-phase alternating-current plasmatron was used for testing. The thermal flux distributions were measured for uncooled targets using thermocouples and thermal imaging tools. Coated samples were installed to the model cooled by water under high pressure. The mechanical strength of coatings at thermocyclic testing was studied and heat conduction of heat-resistant layers was determined in operation conditions.

AB The study of cavitation dynamics in cryogenic environment has critical implications for the performance and safety of liquid rocket engines, but there is no established method to estimate cavitation-induced loads. To help develop Such a computational capability, we employ a multiple-surrogate model-based approach to aid in the model validation and calibration process of a transport-based, homogeneous cryogenic cavitation model. We assess the role of empirical parameters in the cavitation model and uncertainties in material properties via global sensitivity analysis coupled with multiple surrogates including polynomial response surface, radial basis neural network, kriging, and a predicted residual sum of squares-based weighted average surrogate model. The global sensitivity analysis results indicate that the performance of cavitation model is more sensitive to the changes in model parameters than to uncertainties in material properties. Although the impact of uncertainty in temperature-dependent vapor pressure on the predictions seems significant, uncertainty in latent heat influences only temperature field. The influence of wall heat transfer on pressure load is insignificant. We find that slower onset of vapor condensation leads to deviation of the predictions front the experiments. The recalibrated model parameters rectify the importance of evaporation source terms, resulting in significant improvements in pressure predictions. The model parameters need to be adjusted for different fluids, but for a given fluid, they help capture the essential fluid physics with different geometry and operating conditions.

AB Ablation property of the pierced C/C composite nozzle was investigated via fire testing by a combustion gas generator which simulated oxy-rich combustion environments of the liquid rocket engine. Ablation mechanisms of the pierced C/C composite nozzle and effects of the combustion gas parameters were discussed. The results show that the linear ablation rate at the throat of the composite nozzle is 0.055 +/- 0.029mm/s, and the mass ablation rate is 0.186kg/(m(2).s). Ablation behavior of the pierced C/C composite nozzle is directly affected by the compositions, temperature, pressure and the velocity of combustion gases, which shows a non-uniform process. Ablation in the regions ranging from the downstream of the convergent section to the throat is the most severe. Ablation mechanisms of the pierced C/C composite nozzle are cooperation of thermo-chemical ablation and thermo-mechanical erosion. The former is primarily dependent on the combustion temperature and concentrations of H2O and CO2, while the latter is influenced by the pressure and velocity of the combustion gas.

TI Opportunities for a Liquid Rocket Feed System Based on Electric Pumps
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB A feed system for liquid-propellant rocket engines based on electric pumps powered by batteries is proposed. It is proven to stand as a viable alternative to the pressure-gas feed system. The dependence of the feed system mass on the different operating parameters is obtained so as to identify the conditions favoring its adoption, that is, a relatively long burning time and a fairly high chamber pressure. Under such conditions, the proposed system is shown to offer significant mass savings with respect to the pressure-gas system when advanced batteries are used. This advantage is further enhanced by the beneficial effect of chamber pressure on the engine effective exhaust velocity. A test case for a low Earth orbit to geostationary equatorial orbit transfer is also presented to identify the optimum value of the burning time, deriving from the competition between the feed system mass and the effect of gravitational losses.

AB The plume temperature of a solid propellant rocket engine (SPRE) is a fundamental parameter in denoting combustion Status. It is necessary to measure the temperature along both the axis and the radius of the engine. In order to measure the plume temperature distribution of a solid propellant rocket engine, the multi-spectral thermometry has been approved. Previously the pyrometer was developed in the Harbin Institute of Technology of China in 1999 which completed the measurement of SPRE plume temperature and its distribution with multi-spectral technique in aerospace model development for the first time. Following this experience, a new type of multi-target. multi-spectral high-speed pyrometer used in the ground experiments of SPRE plume temperature measurement was developed. The main features of the instrument include the use of a dispersing prism and a photo-diode array to cover the entire spectral band of 0.4 to 1.1 mu m. The optic fibers are used in order to collect and transmit the thermal radiation fluxes. The instrument can measure simultaneously the temperature and emissivity of eight spectra for six uniformly distributed points on the target surface, which are well defined by the hole on the field stop tens. A specially designed S/H (Sample/Hold) circuit, with 48 sample and hold units that were triggered with a signal, measures the multi-spectral and multitarget outputs. It can sample 48 signals with a less than 10ns time difference which is most important for the temperature calculation.

AB When a liquid rocket engine operates in the space environment, droplets have been observed in the thruster plume that can cause contamination of spacecraft surfaces. Condensation can add to this contamination by contributing to the formation and growth of liquid particles in the flow. The condensation process has been modeled using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Models have been developed and incorporated into the direct simulation Monte Carlo code for the processes involved in condensation, which include nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coalescence, and nonsticking collisions. The models are applied to simulate the flow of ethanol in dry air, which has been used to model hydrazine in contamination studies in a vacuum chamber and has been used in several studies of, condensation in a supersonic nozzle. Simulations are conducted of the internal flow in the divergent portion of a supersonic nozzle. The results show reasonable agreement with experimental data for the mass fraction of condensed ethanol along the nozzle axis, but the simulations give a lower value in all cases. The simulation results for the point of condensation onset show good agreement with the experimental data. The results are shown to be sensitive to the nucleation and evaporation rates, as well as the inclusion of the carrier gas,

AB A technique for computationally determining the thermophysical properties of high-energy-density matter propellants is presented. High-energy-density matter compounds are of interest in the liquid rocket engine industry due to their high-density and high-energy content relative to existing industry-standard propellants. To accurately model rocket engine performance, cost, and weight in a conceptual design environment, several thermodynamic and physical properties are required over a range of temperatures and pressures. The approach presented here combines quantum mechanical and molecular dynamic calculations and group additivity methods. A method for improving the force field model coefficients used in the molecular dynamics simulations is included. This approach is used to determine thermophysical properties for two high-energy-density matter compounds of interest: quadricyclane and 2-azido-N, N-dimethylethanamine. The modified force field approach provides results that more accurately match experimental data than the unmodified approach. Launch vehicle and lunar lander case studies are presented to quantify the system-level impact of employing quadricyclane and 2-azido-N, N-dimethylethanamine rather than industry-standard propellants. In both cases, the use of high-energy-density matter propellants provides reductions in vehicle mass compared with industry-standard propellants. The results demonstrate that high-energy-density matter propellants can be an attractive technology for future launch vehicle and lunar lander applications.

AB A series of tests have been conducted to determine the survivability and functionality of a piezoelectric-sensor-based active structural health monitoring (SHM) SMART Tape system under the operating conditions of typical liquid rocket engines such as cryogenic temperature and vibration loads. The performance of different piezoelectric sensors and a low temperature adhesive under cryogenic temperature was first investigated. The active SHM system for liquid rocket engines was exposed to flight vibration and shock environments on a simulated large booster LOX-H(2) engine propellant duct conditioned to cryogenic temperatures to evaluate the physical robustness of the built-in sensor network as well as operational survivability and functionality. Test results demonstrated that the developed SMART Tape system can withstand operational levels of vibration and shock energy on a representative rocket engine duct assembly, and is functional under the combined cryogenic temperature and vibration environment.

AB A novel injection concept for cryogenic liquid propellant rocket engines has been tested and verified successfully using an optically accessible combustion chamber. The injector consists of a porous faceplate made from sinter metal and five LOX posts arranged in a classical parallel showerhead configuration. While liquid oxygen is injected at similar velocities known from typical coaxial injector elements, the fuel enters the combustion chamber at much lower velocities. The flame stabilization for both LOX/H-2 and LOX/CH4 propellant combination has been investigated at sub-, near-, and supercritical pressures. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In the paper the real oscillatory process is reproduced by statement of direct numerical experiment and the mechanism of occurrence and refill of low-frequency acoustic instability in the combustion chamber of the solid propellant rocket engine with the account of flight overload is investigated for the first time. The direct numerical modeling of low-frequency acoustic instability is carried out by means of Davydov's method (method of large particles), which is well-suited for the solutions of many problems of mechanics of the continuous media. The results of numerical modeling are presented here. The hydrodynamic highly nonlinear nature of low-frequency fluctuations connected to structure and character of current in the combustion chamber of the rocket engine on firm fuel are proved to be true.

DE hybrid rocket; air launch vehicles; optimal design
AB A feasibility study and the optimal design was conducted for the application of a hybrid motor with HTPB/LOX combination to the first stage of an air launch system. The feasibility analysis showed that the hybrid motor could successfully be used as a substitute for the solid rocket motor of the first stage of the Pegasus XL if the average specific impulse (I-sp) of the hybrid motor could be approximately 350sec. And the optimal design of the hybrid motor was carried out for a given mission requirement with selected design variables: number of ports, initial oxidizer flux, combustion chamber pressure, and nozzle expansion ratio. The design results show the hybrid motor call be Successfully applicable to the air launching vehicle. And, the optimal design can meet physical constraints of length and diameter imposed by the mother plane installation for a 3.5kg nano-sat to the orbit located on the 200x1500km elliptic orbit plane. Also, it was found that the design results would provide nearly the same design configurations regardless of the selection of objective functions:either mass or length of the engine.

AB In general, for power and propulsion components, the bottleneck of their performance advancement is usually associated with the heat-dissipation capability. For example, rocket propulsion has been used in many different aspects of space travel and military tasks. With the higher demand today for longer-lasting and farther travel and with the extreme temperatures that these elements experience, a breakthrough technology is needed in the cooling of these thrust chambers. In this paper, the idea of using porous metallic foams is examined for their cooling-enhancement capabilities. The goal is to provide more cooling without creating additional pressure drops in the coolant passage. An experimental system was used to investigate the heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop in an annular channel filled with nickel or copper foams. The coolant used was compressed air at 1378 kPa. Constant-heat-flux heaters placed inside the inner tube of the annulus were used to simulate the heat source. Then the experiment was performed under steady state. For both the copper- and nickel-foam-filled annular channels, the heat transfer enhancement was found to be on the order of 20 times over the annular channel without porous insert for the same Darcy velocities. The pressure drop per unit channel length of the foam-filled channel is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in the annular channel without porous insert; therefore, at equal pumping powers in the range of 10 to 100 W, the heat transfer enhancement of an annular metal-foam-filled channel over an annular channel without porous insert is around 3 to 4 times. When assessing the feasibility of applying the metal-foam-filled cooling channel for liquid-fueled rocket engines, we found that beat transfer enhancement ranges between 105 to 150% for equal pressure drops and mass flow rates.

TI Numerical simulation of 3D cavitating flows: Analysis of cavitation head
   drop in turbomachinery
SO JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUATIONS; MODEL
AB The numerical simulation of cavitating flows in turbomachinery is studied at the Turbomachinery and Cavitation team of Laboratoire des Ecoulements Geophysiques et Industriels (LEGI), Grenoble, France in collaboration with the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, CNES), the rocket engine division of Snecma and Numeca International. A barotropic state law is proposed to model the cavitation phenomenon and this model has been integrated in the CFD code FINE/TURBO (TM). An analysis methodology allowing the numerical simulation of the head drop induced by the development of cavitation in cold water was proposed and applied in the case of two four-bladed inducers and one centrifugal pump. Global results were compared to available experimental results. Internal flows in turbomachinery were investigated in depth. Numerical simulations enabled the characterization of the mechanisms leading to the head drop and the visualization of the effects of the development of cavitation on internal flows.

ID BEHAVIOR; POWDERS
AB Aluminum nanoparticles modified with various additives (Ba, gasoline, and organosilicon resin) were obtained by arc plasma recondensation. The chemical composition, morphology, and thermal properties of nanoparticles and the characteristics of combustion of energy-producing condensed systems containing nanoaluminum were studied experimentally. The structure of the particles was determined by X-ray diffraction (a Rigaku Geigerflex diffractometer), transmission electron microscopy (JEM 2000 EX-II), scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM 7401F), atomic force microscopy (SOLVER P-47), and differential scanning calorimetry (NETZSCH STA 409). The replacement of aluminum powder with micron particles with nanodisperse aluminum increased the rate of combustion of stoichiometric compositions on the basis of ammonium perchlorate by an order of magnitude at a pressure of 40 atm. Simultaneously, the mean linear diameter of agglomerates collected from the surface of combustion decreased from 28 to 2 mu m. The results are evidence that the use of energy-producing condensed compositions with nanoaluminum offers much promise for increasing the effectiveness of solid fuel rocket engines.

AB We described earlier that an alkaloid-rich fraction (F(3-5)) from Aspidosperma ulei (Markgr) induces penile erection-like behavioral responses in mice. This study verified a possible relaxant effect of this fraction on isolated rabbit corpus cavernosum (RbCC) strips precontracted by phenylephrine (1 mu M) or K(+) 60mM. F(3-5) (1-300 mu g ml(-1)) relaxed the RbCC strips in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. The relaxant effect of F(3-5) (100 mu g ml(-1)) on phenylephrine contraction was unaffected in the presence of atropine, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazole[4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one and by preincubation with tetrodotoxin, glibenclamide, apamine and charybdotoxin suggesting that mechanisms other than cholinergic, nitrergic, sGC activation or potassium channel opening are probably involved. However, the phasic component of the contraction induced by K(+) 60mM as well as the maximal contraction elicited by increasing external Ca(2+) concentrations in depolarized corpora cavernosa was inhibited by F(3-5). We conclude that F(3-5) relaxes the RbCC smooth muscle, at least in part, through a blockade of calcium influx or its function.

TI Numerical simulation for vortex structure in a turbopump inducer: Close
   relationship with appearance of cavitation instabilities
SO JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
DE CFD; inducer; vortex structure; rotating cavitation; cavitation surge
AB Unsteady cavitation phenomena such as rotating cavitation and cavitation surge are often observed in a turbopump inducer of a rocket engine, sometimes causing undesirable oscillation of the system. Investigation of their mechanism and prediction of such unsteady phenomena are, therefore, crucial in the design of inducers. As many experiments have shown, the appearance of cavitation instability is highly related to the flow rate as well as to the inlet casing geometry. Experimental observations have shown that a very complex flow structure, including such phenomena as backflow and vortices, appears upstream of the inducer. In this work, therefore, we conducted 3D unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations of noncavitating flow in a turbopump inducer, mainly focusing on the vortex structure, for three types of inlet casing geometry with various flow rates. Simulation results showed that the vortex structure for the geometry of the inlet casing and that for the flow rate differed. Especially, it was found that development of the tip leakage vortex was dependent on the inlet casing geometry and the flow rate. This tendency is analogous to that observed between the appearance of rotating cavitation and the casing geometry and flow rate in cavitation tunnel tests. This result strongly implies that the tip leakage vortex is responsible for the appearance of rotating cavitation. By adding a gutter to the inlet casing, it was found that backflow was completely confined to the gutter regardless of flow rates. This numerical result implies that the volume of cavity generated in the backflow region should be stable despite a change of the flow rate, resulting in the suppression of increase of the mass flow gain factor. This result also supports the experimental result that cavitation surge was effectively suppressed using such a casing with a gutter.

TI Resonance frequencies and damping of a combustor acoustically coupled to
   an absorber
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The coupled acoustic system of a cylindrical combustor and an absorber cavity has been investigated experimentally in hot-fire and cold-flow tests. The addition of an absorber volume to the combustor is shown to result in eigenfrequencies of the coupled system systematically different from that of a pure cylindrical resonance volume. The general behavior of the coupled system is explained based on an analytical one-dimensional analysis of the problem. Numerical simulations in two dimensions result in very good agreement with experimental observations. A three-dimensional simulation of a cylinder equipped with 40 absorbers demonstrates the relevance of the reported phenomena for rocket engines equipped with absorber rings. Experimental data on the damping behavior of an absorber are given and the damping of absorbers is discussed based on the numerically obtained acoustic eigenmodes of the coupled system.

AB This paper is based on the concepts of lagrangian Reynolds transport equation (LRTE), momentum, and the generalized total kinetic power of a rocket. The wood rocket model is used as a vivid model to explain propulsive efficiency of a rocket. We prove that the novel U-turn launch mode can convert total kinetic power and gravitational potential energy into rocket propulsive power. Furthermore, we use the first stage rocket engine of the Saturn V as an example to simulate and analyze its propulsive efficiency computationally with Matlab software. In conclusion, this revolutionary launch mode has the potential to dramatically improve the propulsive efficiency of launch vehicles.

AB A technique for the determination of the axisymmetric thermoviscoelastoplastic state of laminated thin shells made of a damageable material is developed. The technique is based on the kinematic equations of the theory of thin shells that account for transverse shear strains. The thermoviscoplastic equations, which describe the deformation of a shell element along paths of small curvature, are used as the constitutive equations. The equivalent stress that appears in the kinetic equations of damage and creep is determined from a failure criterion that accounts for the stress mode. The thermoviscoplastic deformation of a two-layer shell that models an element of a rocket engine nozzle is considered as an example.

One is bridge condition on the concave surface and the other is slip line condition in the process of patch winding. This paper puts forward the judgmental principles and corresponsive solutions by applying differential geometry theory and space geometry theory. To validate the feasibility of the patch winding method, the winding control code is programmed. Furthermore, rocket engine crust experiment and vane winding experiment are carried out.

TI Numerical analysis of cavitation instabilities in inducer blade cascade

DT Article
ID SIMULATION; FLOW; EQUATIONS; BEHAVIOR
AB The cavitation behavior of a four-blade rocket engine turbopump inducer was simulated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FINE/TURBO (TM). The code was modified to take into account a cavitation model based on a homogeneous approach of cavitation, coupled with a barotropic state law for the liquid/vapor mixture. In the present study, the numerical model of unsteady cavitation was applied to a four-blade cascade drawn from the inducer geometry. Unsteady behavior of cavitation sheets attached to the inducer blade suction side depends on the flow rate and cavitation number sigma. Numerical simulations of the transient evolution of cavitation on the blade cascade were performed for the nominal flow rate and different cavitation numbers, taking into account simultaneously the four blade-to-blade channels. Depending on the flow parameters, steady or unsteady behaviors spontaneously take place. In unsteady cases, subsynchronous or supersynchronous regimes were observed. Some mechanisms responsible for the development of these instabilities are proposed and discussed.

DE hollow cylinder; independence of forces effect; crack resistance
AB The stress-strain state of a hollow cylinder (pipe) with lateral holes is considered. The pipe is under the action of internal and external hydrostatic pressures P-1 and P-2 and also a temperature effect. Such a pipe is used in oil-gas recovery, rocket engineering, chemical machinery industry and etc. There is no detailed analytic solution of this problem in literature to date. The number of holes through which a liquid or gas can flow into the pipe interior (and vice versa) depends on the loads, the size of the cross-section and the material of the pipe. The proper selection of the arrangement of holes and their diameters is determined from an analytic solution. In addition, the maximum boundary loads (of pressures) at which the pipe cracks is also found. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dynamics of a simply supported cylindrical shell submerged in liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are considered. The shell itself is bounded by a rigid outer cylinder with closed rigid ends. This configuration gives rise to two fluid-filled cavities-an inner cylindrical cavity. and an outer annular cavity. Such geometries are common in rocket engine design. The natural frequencies and modes of the fluid-structure system are computed by combining the rigid wall acoustic cavity modes and the in vacuo structural modes into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. Eigenvalue veering is observed near the intersections of the curves representing natural frequencies of the rigid wall acoustic and the in vacuo structural modes. In the case of a shell submerged in liquid hydrogen, system frequencies near these intersections are as much as 30% lower than the corresponding in vacuo structural frequencies. Because of its high density, the frequency reductions in the presence of liquid oxygen are even more dramatic. The forced responses of a shell submerged in liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, while subject to a harmonic point excitation, are also presented. The responses in the presence of fluid are found to be quite distinct from those of the structure in vacuo.

AB The thermal stability of kerosene-based rocket propellants enables successful regenerative cooling of liquid rocket engines. This work experimentally investigates the effect of sulfur level and red dye concentrations on the thermal stability of RP-1 and RP-2 rocket fuels. A high Reynolds number thermal stability test unit evaluated various compositions of the fuels. The experiment consisted of an electrically heated, stainless steel capillary tube with controlled fuel outlet temperature. As deposits built up inside the capillary tube, an optical pyrometer monitored external temperature profiles. Multiple runs at individual test sites provided results on measurement repeatability. Testing at two facilities provided results on measurement reproducibility. The technique is able to distinguish between RP-1 and RP-2 rocket fuels which mainly differ in their sulfur concentrations. Red dye is shown to have a measurable negative impact on thermal stability. Carbon burn-off analysis of residue in the capillary tubes correlates with the external temperature results.
