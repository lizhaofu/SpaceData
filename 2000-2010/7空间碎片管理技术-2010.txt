AB In a little over four decades, the Indian Space Program has carved a niche for itself with the unique application driven program oriented towards National development. The end-to-end capability approach of the space projects in the country call for innovative practices and procedures in assuring the quality and reliability of space systems. The System Reliability (SR) efforts initiated at the start of the projects continue during the entire life cycle of the project encompassing design, development, realisation, assembly, testing and integration and during launch. Even after the launch, SR groups participate in the on-orbit evaluation of transponders in communication satellites and camera systems in remote sensing satellites. SR groups play a major role in identification, evaluation and inculcating quality practices in work centres involved in the fabrication of mechanical, electronics and propulsion systems required for Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO's) launch vehicle and spacecraft projects. Also the reliability analysis activities like prediction, assessment and demonstration as well as de-rating analysis, Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and worst-case analysis are carried out by SR groups during various stages of project realisation. These activities provide the basis for project management to take appropriate techno-managerial decisions to ensure that the required reliability goals are met. Extensive test facilities catering to the needs of the space program has been set up. A system for consolidating the experience and expertise gained for issue of standards called product assurance specifications to be used in all ISRO centres has also been established.

AB This paper presents in brief the formulation for lateral and longitudinal dynamics associated with the separation and pull out of an ongoing functional stage from the spent stage of a multistage launch vehicle using separation motors as jettisoning system. Taguchi method is employed to understand the influencing parameters in the separation process. It is possible to minimize the number of Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS) by Taguchi's orthogonal array. Statistical analysis has been carried out to identify the probability distribution function (PDF) for reliability and safety assessment of the stage separation system. The tolerances on the pull out time, relative velocity, lateral gap and longitudinal clearances between the separating bodies are taken into account while examining the non-occurrence of collision between the separating bodies. Lateral gap/dynamic clearance between stages are found to be very vital from collision aspects. This study clearly demonstrates the applicability of Taguchi method to capture the essential Monte-Carlo simulation results in the stage separation process. The method of approach followed in this study will be useful to understand the dynamic behavior of the separating bodies during the stage separation process of multistage launch vehicles.

AB The 'particles-in-a-box' (PIB) model introduced by Talent [Talent, D.L. Analytic model for orbital debris environmental management. J. Spacecraft Rocket, 29 (4), 508-513, 1992.] removed the need for computer-intensive Monte Carlo simulation to predict the gross characteristics of an evolving debris environment. The PlB model was described using a differential equation that allows the stability of the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment to be tested by a straightforward analysis of the equation's coefficients. As part of an ongoing research effort to investigate more efficient approaches to evolutionary modelling and to develop a suite of educational tools, a new PlB model has been developed. The model, entitled Fast Debris Evolution (FADE), employs a first-order differential equation to describe the rate at which new objects >= 10 cm are added and removed from the environment. Whilst Talent [Talent, D.L. Analytic model for orbital debris environmental management. J. Spacecraft Rocket, 29 (4), 508-513, 1992.] based the collision theory for the PlB approach on collisions between gas particles and adopted specific values for the parameters of the model from a number of references, the form and coefficients of the FADE model equations can be inferred from the outputs of future projections produced by high-fidelity models, such as the DAMAGE model.
   The FADE model has been implemented as a client-side, web-based service using JavaScript embedded within a HTML document. Due to the simple nature of the algorithm, FADE can deliver the results of future projections immediately in a graphical format, with complete user-control over key simulation parameters. Historical and future projections for the >= 10 cm. LEO debris environment under a variety of different scenarios are possible, including business as usual, no future launches, post-mission disposal and remediation. A selection of results is presented with comparisons with predictions made using the DAMAGE environment model. The results demonstrate that the FADE model is able to capture comparable time-series of collisions and number of objects as predicted by DAMAGE in several scenarios. Further, and perhaps more importantly, its speed and flexibility allows the user to explore and understand the evolution of the space debris environment. (C) 2009 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) consists of processes managing erroneous conditions that systems may encounter during their operational life by either designing out failures early on or defending and mitigating any possible failures. A successful implementation of ISHM consists of the following four components: data sensors, computations, data sinks, and visualization modules. In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms as a candidate for developing ISHM visualization modules. VR allows for a complete and spatially accurate 3-D model of a system to be displayed in real time. It provides a medium for improved data assimilation and analysis through its core tenants of immersion, interaction, and navigation. Furthermore, VR allows for integrating graphical, functional, and measurement data in the same platform-providing for the development of subsequent risk-analysis modules. The research objectives of this paper are focused on creating a detailed visual model of a multisensor rocket engine test facility inside a VR platform and demonstrating the capability of the VR platform in integrating graphical, measurement, and health data in an immersive, navigable, and interactive manner. A human-based performance evaluation of the VR platform is also presented. These research objectives are addressed using an example of a multisensor rocket-engine portable test stand at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center's E-3 test facility.

AB IBEX provides the observations needed for detailed modeling and in-depth understanding of the interstellar interaction (McComas et al. in Physics of the Outer Heliosphere, Third Annual IGPP Conference, pp. 162-181, 2004; Space Sci. Rev., 2009a, this issue). From mission design to launch and acquisition, this goal drove all flight system development. This paper describes the management, design, testing and integration of IBEX's flight system, which successfully launched from Kwajalein Atoll on October 19, 2008. The payload is supported by a simple, Sun-pointing, spin-stabilized spacecraft with no deployables. The spacecraft bus consists of the following subsystems: attitude control, command and data handling, electrical power, hydrazine propulsion, RF, thermal, and structures. A novel 3-step orbit approach was employed to put IBEX in its highly elliptical, 8-day final orbit using a Solid Rocket Motor, which provided large delta-V after IBEX separated from the Pegasus launch vehicle; an adapter cone, which interfaced between the SRM and Pegasus; Motorized Lightbands, which performed separation from the Pegasus, ejection of the adapter cone, and separation of the spent SRM from the spacecraft; a ShockRing isolation system to lower expected launch loads; and the onboard Hydrazine Propulsion System. After orbit raising, IBEX transitioned from commissioning to nominal operations and science acquisition. At every phase of development, the Systems Engineering and Mission Assurance teams supervised the design, testing and integration of all IBEX flight elements.

AB This paper describes a novel optimisation-based framework for analysing the robustness of advanced flight control laws for reusable launch vehicles. The proposed analysis methods are applied and tested on an industrial-standard simulation model of a reusable launch vehicle equipped with a full authority nonlinear dynamic inversion-based flight control law. The reliability, computational complexity and efficiency of the framework are evaluated against standard industrial approaches based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results of the study show that the proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve both the reliability and efficiency of the flight clearance process for future reusable launch vehicles.

AB Man's activities in space are creating a shell of space debris around planet Earth which provides a growing risk of collision with operating satellites and manned systems. Including both the larger tracked objects and the small, untracked debris, more than 98% of the estimated 600,000 objects larger than 1 cm currently in orbit are "space junk"-dead satellites, expended rocket stages, debris from normal operations, fragments from explosions and collisions, and other material. Recognizing the problem, space faring nations have joined together to develop three basic principles for minimizing the growth of the debris population: prevent on-orbit breakups, remove spacecraft and orbital stages that have reached the end of their mission operations from the useful densely populated orbit regions, and limit the objects released during normal operations. This paper provides an overview of what is being done to support these three principles and describes proposals that an active space traffic control service to warn satellite operators of pending collisions with large objects combined with a program to actively remove large objects may reduce the rate of future collisions. The paper notes that cost and cost effectiveness are important considerations that will affect the evolution of such systems.

AB The ESA space debris population model MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) considers firings of solid rocket motors (SRM) as a debris source with the associated generation of slag and dust particles. The resulting slag and dust population is a major contribution to the sub-millimetre size debris environment in Earth orbit. The current model version, MASTER-2005, is based on the simulation of 1076 orbital SRM firings which contributed to the long-term debris environment. A comparison of the modelled flux with impact data from returned surfaces shows that the shape and quantity of the modelled SRM dust distribution matches that of recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array measurements very well. However, the absolute flux level for dust is under-predicted for some of the analysed Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) surfaces. This points into the direction of some past SRM firings not included in the current event database. The most suitable candidates for these firings are the large number of SRM retro-burns of return capsules. Objects released by those firings have highly eccentric orbits with perigees in the lower regions of the atmosphere. Thus, they produce no long-term effect on the debris environment. However, a large number of those firings during the on-orbit time frame of LDEF might lead to an increase of the dust population for some of the LDEF surfaces. In this paper, the influence of SRM retro-burns on the short- and long-term debris environment is analysed. The existing firing database is updated with gathered information of some 800 Russian retro-firings. Each firing is simulated with the MASTER population generation module. The resulting population is compared against the existing background population of SRM slag and dust particles in terms of spatial density and flux predictions. (C) 2006 COSPAR.

AB A new paradigm for ceramic composite structural components enables functionality in heat exchange, transpiration, detailed shape, and thermal strain management that significantly exceeds the prior art. The paradigm is based on the use of three-dimensional fiber reinforcement that: is tailored to the specific shape, stress, and thermal requirements of a structural application and therefore generally requires innovative textile methods for each real-features include the attainment of thin skins (less than 1 mm) that are nevertheless structurally robust, transpiration holes formed without cutting fibers, double curvature, compliant integral attachment to other structures that avoids thermal stress buildup, and microcomposite ceramic matrices that minimize spalling and allow the formation of smooth surfaces. All these features can be combined into structures of very varied gross shape and function, using a wide range of materials such as all-oxide systems and SiC and carbon fibers in SiC matrices. Illustrations are drawn from rocket nozzles, thermal protection systems, and gas turbine engines. The new den challenges that arise for such material/structure systems are being met by specialized computational modeling that departs significantly in the representation of materials behavior from that used in conventional finite element methods.

AB Indian Space Research Organization successfully carried out more than 40 space missions, during the last four decades, in the area of space sciences, spacecraft technologies, space applications and launch vehicle technologies. Mission planning and mission design are the most important multi-disciplinary elements in realizing these objectives. The present article describes the methodology followed in mission planning and mission design for different types of space missions of ISRO, bringing out the trade-off and inter-disciplinary nature of these activities. Important aspects of mission planning in the lift-off phase, the atmospheric and exoatmospheric phases of a launch vehicle are described. A number of conflicting mission constraints have to be addressed in designing an optimal and robust mission profile for the launch. In addition to reducing aerodynamic and structural loads, considerations related to flight safety and ground station visibility are important parameters. Special launch considerations are to be addressed in designing trajectories for lunar or planetary missions. Launch phase would extend up to injection of the spacecraft in the desired orbit. Thereupon, the spacecraft mission operations are divided into initial phase and operational phase. Initial orbital phase operations include, orbit raising and acquisition operations, and testing of the payloads. The operational phase of spacecraft mission covers, satellite health monitoring and maintenance, station keeping, special operations on the spacecraft, trend analysis and any contingency operations, all leading to gainful utilization of the satellite. A number of mission operations also have now become imperative for mitigating the detrimental effects of ever increasing space debris.

TI The relevance of economic data in the decision-making process for
   orbital launch vehicle programs, a US perspective
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past fifteen years, major U.S. initiatives for the development of new launch vehicles have been remarkably unsuccessful. The list is long: NLI, SLI, and X-33. not to mention several cancelled programs aimed at high speed airplanes (NASP, HSCT) which would share some similar technological problems. The economic aspects of these programs are equally as important to their success as are the technical aspects. In fact, by largely ignoring economic realities in the decisions to undertake these programs and in subsequent management decisions, space agencies (and their commercial partners) have inadvertently contributed to the eventual demise of these efforts. The transportation revolution that was envisaged by the promises of these programs has never occurred. Access to space is still very expensive; reliability of launch vehicles has remained constant over the years; and market demand has been relatively low, volatile and slow to develop. The changing international context of the industry (launching overcapacity, etc.) has also worked against the investment in new vehicles in the U.S. Today, unless there are unforeseen technical breakthroughs, orbital space access is likely to continue as it has been with high costs and market stagnation. Space exploration will require significant launching capabilities. The details of the future needs are not yet well defined. But, the question of the launch costs, the overall demand for vehicles, and the size and type of role that NASA will play in the overall launch market is likely to influence the industry. This paper will emphasize the lessons learned from the economic and management perspective from past launch programs, analyze the issues behind the demand for launches, and project the challenges that NASA will face as only one new customer in a very complex market situation. It will be important for NASA to make launch vehicle decisions based as much on economic considerations as it does on solving new technical challenges. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE space debris; mitigation; policy
AB Since the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics issued the first position paper on space debris 25 years ago, recognition of the threats posed by debris in Earth orbit and the need to act now to protect the future space environment have become widespread. This new awareness has been matched with positive actions by spacecraft and launch vehicle designers, manufacturers, and operators. As a result, a common set of space debris mitigation policies and practices has been forming at both the national and international levels.

TI A constant gain Kalman filter approach for the prediction of re-entry of
   risk objects
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The accurate estimation of the predicted re-entry time of decaying space debris objects is very important for proper planning of mitigation strategies and hazard assessment. This paper highlights the implementation strategies adopted for the online re-entry prediction using Kalman filter approach with constant gains with the states being the semi-major axis, eccentricity and ballistic coefficient and using the measurements of the apogee height and perigee height derived from the Two Line Elements provided by agencies like USSPACECOM. Only a very simple model is utilised for the orbit propagation and a basic feature of the present approach is that any unmodellable state and measurement errors can be accounted for by adjusting the Kalman gains which are chosen based on a suitable cost function. In this paper we provide the details of validating this approach by utilising three re-entries of debris objects, namely, US Sat. No. 25947, SROSS-C2 Satellite and COSMOS 1043 rocket body. These three objects re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 4th March 2000, 12th July 2001 and 19th January 2002, respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil in laboratory microcosm experiments was amended with dried and milled crop residues of onion (Allium cepa L. cv. Mission) or garlic (A. sativa L. cv. California Early). The amendments, along with the additional factors of amendment concentration (0, 1 or 3% (w/w)) and soil temperature (23 or 39 degrees C), were evaluated with respect to germination of seeds of the weedy annual plants Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. (barnyard grass), Portulaca oleracea L. (common purslane), Sisymbrium irio L. (London rocket) and Solanum nigrum L. (black nightshade). Deleterious effects of seed exposure to 39 degrees C versus 23 degrees C were demonstrated in ECHCG, POROL, and SSYIR; and to increasing amendment concentration and the [concentration x temperature] interaction in all four plant species tested (P < 0.05). The effect of garlic versus onion amendment was significant only in SOLNI, where garlic residues demonstrated more herbistatic and/or herbicidal activity. The results of these experiments showed that the garlic and onion plant residues were capable of causing significant reductions in seed germination during their decomposition in soil, but only at elevated (39 degrees C versus 23 degrees C) soil temperature. At the agricultural level, activity of these residues could be exploited as a component of integrated weed management using appropriate crop sequencing, and may extend utility of soil heating treatments (e.g. solarization) for weed control to cooler climates or seasons, or for shorter treatment durations.

AB A method for the implementation of integrated three-degree-of-freedom constrained entry guidance for reusable launch vehicle is presented. Given any feasible entry conditions, terminal area energy management interface conditions, and the reference trajectory generated onboard then, the method can generate a longitudinal guidance profile rapidly, featuring linear quadratic regular method and a proportional-integral-derivative tracking law with time-varying gains, which satisfies all the entry corridor constraints and meets the requirements with high precision. Afterwards, by utilizing special features of crossrange parameter, establishing bank-reversal corridor, and determining bank-reversals according to dynamically adjusted method, the algorithm enables the lateral entry guidance system to fly a wide range of missions and provides reliable and good performance in the presence of significant aerodynamic modeling uncertainty. Fast trajectory guidance profiles and simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various missions and aerodynamic uncertainties are presented to demonstrate the capacity and reliability of this method.

AB A major issue in achieving direct launch to space using electromagnetic railguns from the surface of the earth is that we are at the bottom of a gravity well, requiring very high launch velocities to achieve orbit insertion. The atmosphere is most dense at the earth's surface-this, combined with high velocity, leads to very stressing thermal conditions for the launch aerobody. To minimize aerodynamic losses, a typical hypersonic flight body is a blunt slender cone. The thermal loads are greatest on the nosetip of this cone, and for small bodies (< 10 kg) the thermal loads may exceed the capabilities of present passive thermal protection systems, such as dense, ablative carbon phenolics. Even for launch from a high-altitude airborne platform, aerothermal loads can be considerable unless rocket assist is provided. This paper discusses aspects of the launch package and characteristics of the railgun needed to achieve orbit insertion velocities.

AB The nation's goals to replace the aging Space Shuttle fleet and pursue exploration of our solar system and beyond will require more robust, less costly launch vehicles and spacecraft. This paper presents a novel sliding mode control approach, sliding mode control driven by sliding mode disturbance observers with gain adaptation, for a reusable launch vehicle flight control system design as a way to improve robustness to many phenomena such as modeling uncertainties and disturbances, while retaining continuity of control without using high control gains. Because of the robustness to external disturbances and modeling uncertainties, the proposed flight control system design also can reduce cost by requiring less time in design cycle and preflight analyses. This design is applied to terminal area energy management and approach/landing. The multiple-loop flight controller design features low-order disturbance observers that rely only on knowledge of the bounds of the disturbance. A gain-adaptation algorithm is included in the disturbance observer design that provides the least gain needed for existence of the sliding mode. Six degree-of-freedom computer simulations of the X-33 technology demonstration suborbital reusable launch vehicle for nominal and severe wind-gust tests demonstrate improved performance over a more conventional, classical control system design.

AB The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) recognizes the importance of the current space debris scenario, and the impact it has on the effective utilization of space technology for the improvement in the quality of life on the Earth. ISRO is committed to effective management of the threats due to space debris. Towards this commitment ISRO works on different aspects of space debris, including the debris mitigation measures. This paper highlights the activities and achievements in the implementation of the mitigation measures. ISRO successfully designed and developed a propellant venting system for implementation in the existing upper stage of India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), which uses Earth-storable liquid propellants. GSLV also employs passivation of the Cryogenic Upper Stage at the end of its useful mission. ISRO's communication satellites in GSO are designed with adequate propellant margins for re-orbiting at the end of their useful life to a higher graveyard orbit. A typical successful operation in connection with INSAT-2C is described. ISRO developed its debris environmental models and software to predict the close approach of any of the debris to the functional satellites. The software are regularly used for the debris risk management of the orbiting spacecraft and launch vehicles. ISRO recognizes the role of international cooperation in the debris mitigation measures and actively contributes to the efforts of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS).

AB This paper reviews the history of cryogenic fluid management technology development and infusion into both the Saturn and Centaur vehicles. Ground testing and analysis proved inadequate to demonstrate full scale performance. As a consequence flight demonstration with full scale vehicle was required by both the Saturn and Centaur programs to build confidence that problems were addressed. However; the flight vehicles were highly limited on flight instrumentation and the flight demonstration "locked-in" the design without challenging the function of design elements. Projects reviewed include: the Aerobee Sounding Rocket Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) tests which served as a valuable stepping stone to flight demonstration and built confidence in the ability to handle hydrogen in low gravity; the Saturn IVB Fluid Management Qualification flight test; the Atlas Centaur demonstration flights to develop two burn capability; and finally the Titan Centaur two post mission flight tests.

TI Introduction of a nozzle throat diameter dependency into the SRM dust
   size distribution
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE SRM dust size distribution; SRM firings; nozzle throat diameter;
   aluminium projectiles; validation results
AB The ESA space debris population model MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) considers 1032 firings of solid rocket motors (SRM) with the associated generation of SRM slag and dust particles in its current version. The resulting dust population is a major contribution to the sub-millimetre size space debris environment in Earth orbit. For the modelling of each SRM dust release event a detailed knowledge of the particle size distribution is essential. However, the knowledge of the particle sizes after passing the nozzle throat is poor. The current dust implementation in the MASTER model assumes a fixed size distribution which is identically used for both large upper stages and small apogee motors. This assumption can lead to an over-representation of large dust particles in regions, where mainly apogee motors are used (i.e., Geostationary Earth Orbit) and an under-representation in lower altitudes, where large stages predominate. In this paper, a concept for the improvement of SRM dust size modelling is discussed. It will be shown that an introduction of a nozzle throat diameter dependency into the dust size distribution enables a more precise modelling of SRM dust release events. The improved SRM dust size distribution is going to be used by the MASTER-2005 space debris model which is currently under development by the Institute of Aerospace Systems and QinetiQ (UK) under ESA contract.

AB Multiphysics simulations are playing an increasingly important role in computational science and engineering for applications ranging from aircraft design to medical treatments. These simulations require integration of techniques and tools from multiple disciplines, and in turn demand new advanced technologies to integrate independently developed physics solvers effectively. In this paper, we describe some numerical, geometrical, and system software components required by such integration, with a concrete case study of detailed, three-dimensional, parallel rocket simulations involving system-level interactions among fluid, solid, and combustion, as well as subsystem-level interactions. We package these components into a software framework that provides common-refinement based methods for transferring data between potentially non-matching meshes, novel and robust face-offsetting methods for tracking Lagrangian surface meshes, as well as integrated support for parallel mesh optimization, remeshing, algebraic manipulations, performance monitoring, and high-level data management and I/O. From these general, reusable framework components we construct domain-specific building blocks to facilitate integration of parallel, multiphysics simulations from high-level specifications that are easy to read and can also be visualized graphically. These reusable building blocks are integrated with independently developed physics codes to perform various multiphysics simulations.

AB Based on requirements for a next-generation rocket test facility, elements of a prototype intelligent rocket test facility (IRTF) have been implemented. The preliminary results provide the basis for future advanced development and validation using rocket test stand facilities at Stennis Space Center (SSC). Key components include distributed smart sensor elements integrated using a knowledge-driven environment. One of the specific goals is to imbue sensors with the intelligence needed to perform self-diagnosis of health and to participate in a hierarchy of health determination at sensor, process, and system levels. We have identified issues important to further development of health-enabled networks, which should be of interest to others working with smart sensors and intelligent health management systems.

AB Strategic ballistic missiles are the long-range missiles designed to intercept stationary, defined targets. Guidance is in the boost phase which represents only a small fraction of the total time of flight of the missile. A missile has to be guided and steered to the required position and velocity states at the end of the boost phase. The problem of guiding a vehicle in atmospheric phase in the presence of drag and lift, poses a challenge for the designer. This paper describes an energy management guidance scheme for guiding the vehicle in atmospheric phase of the flight. The estimated drag is taken care of by the guidance scheme. Uncertainty in velocity due to drag or impulse variation at the end of the boost phase are corrected by an augmented velocity package. A closed-loop guidance scheme has been used during this phase also. A ballistic re-entry has been considered for this design study.

AB This paper presents in brief the formulation used for the studies of lateral and longitudinal dynamics associated with separation and pull out of an ongoing functional stage from the spent stage of a multistage launch vehicle using retro rockets as jettisoning system. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed to solve the governing nonlinear differential equations of motion to obtain the state vectors of the separating bodies. A statistical method is adapted to account for the off nominal design parameters of the bodies undergoing separation and the jettisoning system. The tolerances in magnitude of the pull out time, relative velocity, lateral gap and longitudinal clearances between the separating bodies were used to find out the nonoccurrence of collision between the separating bodies. This procedure helps in designing and adapting a suitable jettisoning system to achieve collision free separation of multistage launch vehicle stages. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mission of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes to enable improved prediction of climate. weather. and natural hazards for present and future generations. The ESE has an end-to-end strategy to assure that information. understanding. and capabilities derived from its research program achieve maximum usefulness to the scientific and decision-making communities. Small satellites (< 500 kg) have been crucial contributors to satisfying the research strategy since the inception of NASA's Earth observation program in the 1960s. In the last decade, NASA's ESE has placed a renewed emphasis on small satellites. This reemphasis reflects advancements in compact sensor, small satellite bus. and launch vehicle technologies in addition to management innovations. Near term and advanced planning suggest that this trend will continue. A number of related small satellite missions have been recently launched, are in development. or are planned. Multi-satellite constellations under study include small satellites as key architectural elements. Studies indicate that low cost. capable microspacecraft along with compact sensors and increased autonomy are technology enablers to the sensorwebs and associated distributed spacecraft infrastructure required to realize the long-term NASA Earth Science Vision (ESV).

AB It is believed that a potential means for further significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results also in a stimulation of launch rates of small satellites, is to make the launcher reusable. to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Therefore, not only launching small satellites with expendable rocket on non-regular flights but also with reusable rockets on regular flights should be considered for the long term. However. developing. producing and operating reusable rockets require a fundamental change in the current "business as usual" philosophy. Under current conditions, it might not be possible to develop, to produce or to operate a reusable vehicle fleet economically. The favorite philosophy is based on "smart business" processes adapted by the author using cost engineering techniques. In the following paper, major strategies for reducing costs are discussed. which are applied for a representative program proposal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To track the three-dimensional behavior of liquid surfaces in storage tanks on orbit, a numerical scheme based on the level set method was developed. For the verification of the numerical methods, experimental data were acquired through the observation of the unsteady deformations of liquid surfaces in cylindrical containers under low-gravity conditions in a drop tower. Primary emphasis was placed on the dynamic behavior of the liquid surface and the displacement of the contact line on the solid wall. Based on the results, the boundary condition for surface tension was discussed and the model of wetting phenomena was adequately introduced into the computation. Compared with the experimental data, the corresponding numerical results showed good agreement. With the developed code, the flowfields at the draining process in the liquid oxygen (LOchi) tank for the upper-stage propulsion system of an H-IIA launch vehicle under low-gravity conditions were also investigated. It was found that the buoyancy induced by a slight acceleration was efficient to prevent dip growth and that the serviceable propellant in the launch-vehicle tank could thereby be increased in a realistic situation.

AB A Post-Flight Investigation was initiated by the European Space Agency to analyze impacts on solar arrays of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), exposed to space for 8.25 years at approximately 600 km altitude. The solar cells deployed during the first Service Mission (SM-1 in December 1993) were retrieved in March 2002 as part of Service Mission 3B (SM-313). A sub-panel of 2 m(2) was cut from the arrays for subsequent selection and removal of individual solar cells for analysis. Six cells (4.8 x 10(-3) m(2)) were surveyed for flux of all craters of sizes greater than 5 microns. Analytical scanning electron microscopy was used to analyse residues in 111 features of 3-4000 micron conchoidal detachment diameter (D-co), examined on 23 solar cells. Eighty three show identifiable residue: 38 are Space Debris impacts and 45 Micrometeoroid impacts. Of the remaining 28, 2 contain residue of ambiguous origin, 1 is probably a minor manufacturing flaw, 1 is obscured by contamination, and 24 are unresolved, lacking recognizable residue.
   The majority of space debris impacts on the SM-3B cells are less than 80 microns D-co, dominated by Al-rich residue, probably of solid rocket motor origin, although three may be due to sodium metal droplet impacts. Three larger features include paint pigment and binder, ferrous alloy, and possible carbon-fibre composite material debris.
   Micrometeoroid residues are found across the entire crater size range and dominate features of between 100 and 1000 microns, their residues are similar to those found in earlier SM-1 surveys. Fe- and Mg-rich silicates dominate; Fe sulphides are common and there are occasional vesicular Ni- and S-bearing mafic silicates of hydrous phyllosilicate origin. A single sodium aluminosilicate residue and one Fe Ni metal residue were found; as well as enigmatic Mg- and S-bearing residues, all considered as probably of micrometeoroid origin. A few Fe-, O- and C-bearing residues were classified as of ambiguous origin. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

DE space debris; mitigation; geosynchronous transfer orbit
AB Missions to geosynchronous orbits remain one of the most important elements of space launch traffic, accounting for 40% of all missions to Earth orbit and beyond during the four-year period 2000-2003. The vast majority of these missions leave one or more objects in geosynchronous transfer orbits (GTOs), contributing oil a short-term or long-term basis to the space debris population. National and international space debris mitigation guidelines seek to curtail the accumulation of debris in orbits which penetrate the regions of low Earth orbit and of geosynchronous orbit. The orbital lifetime of objects in GTO can be greatly influenced by the initial values of perigee, inclination, and right ascension of the orbital plane, leading to orbital lifetimes of from less than one month to more than 100 years. An examination of the characteristic GTOs employed by launch vehicles from around the world has been conducted. The consequences of using perigees above 300 km and super-synchronous apogees, typically above 40,000 km, have been identified. In addition, the differences in orbital behavior of launch vehicle stages and mission-related debris in GTOs have been investigated. Greater coordination and cooperation between space launch service providers and spacecraft designers and owners could significantly improve overall compliance with guidelines to mitigate the accumulation of debris in Earth orbit.

AB The second-generation reusable launch vehicle will incorporate sophisticated new guidance and control methods to increase the system's flexibility, in particular making it a practical vehicle for unmanned cargo missions. This project focuses on trajectory design and guidance for the terminal area energy management phase of flight, where traditional methods have produced limited results. Fuzzy logic methods are used to make onboard autonomous gliding return trajectory design robust to the possibility of control surface failures, thus, increasing the flexibility of unmanned gliding recovery and landing. Fuzzy inference systems are used to design the trajectory and provide guidance commands for the vehicle bank angle and negative z axis acceleration. Fuzzy logic provides a practical means of incorporating conflicting objectives and constraints in choosing trajectory parameters. The method has the flexibility to choose these parameters from a continuum of possible values. The design is validated using a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom simulation of the X-33 technology demonstrator.

TI Autonomous safety and reliability features of the K-1 avionics system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
AB Kistler Aerospace Corporation is developing the K-1, a fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Both stages return to the launch site using parachutes and airbags. Initial flight operations will occur from Woomera, Australia. K-I guidance is performed autonomously. Each stage of the K-I employs a triplex, fault tolerant avionics architecture, including three fault tolerant computers and three radiation hardened Embedded GPS/INS units with a hardware voter. The K-1 has an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system on each stage residing in the three vehicle computers based on similar systems in commercial aircraft. During first-stage ascent, the IVHM system performs an Instantaneous Impact Prediction (IIP) calculation 25 times per second, initiating an abort in the event the vehicle is outside a predetermined safety corridor for at least 3 consecutive calculations. In this event, commands are issued to terminate thrust, separate the stages, dump all propellant in the first-stage, and initiate a normal landing sequence. The second-stage flight computer calculates its ability to reach orbit along its state vector, initiating an abort sequence similar to the first stage if it cannot. On a nominal mission, following separation, the second-stage also performs calculations to assure its impact point is within a safety corridor.
   The K-1's guidance and control design is being tested through simulation with hardware-in-the-loop at Draper Laboratory. Kistler's verification strategy assures reliable and safe operation of the K-1. (C) 2003 Kistler Aerospace Corporation. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on high level safety and cost requirements, system architects and subsystem engineers are called upon to provide requirements at a lower level during the conceptual design phase of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). This paper describes an event tree based methodology for quantitatively assessing the limits of some of the lower-level Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) requirements during RLV conceptual design. The metrics assessed in the paper are fault detection coverage, false alarm probability, fault isolation capability, probability of IVHM failing to detect a fault, and safety allocation. The fault detection and isolation metrics were assessed based on their applicability with respect to cost and safety in the mission and turnaround phase of the RLV operations. The paper shows that the mission-phase requirement for IVHM fault detection coverage for a subsystem is large (more stringent) when IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, the failure remediation probability is small, and the subsystem is already reliable. The requirement on IVHM false alarm rate in the mission phase is small (more stringent) when the subsystem is reliable, IVHM needs to make the subsystem safer, and IVHM should cause fewer false aborts.
   The paper concludes by stressing the use of appropriate system analysis and optimization in allocating IVHM requirements to a subsystem of the RLV. Although the paper is written from an IVHM and RLV perspective, it is targeted towards system engineers/architects who are interested in estimating the effects of fault detection and isolation requirements during conceptual design.

AB The NASA Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program is evaluating various concepts for less expensive and reduced-risk access to space. Critical to these goals are more reliable and easily maintained vehicles, with high fidelity Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) systems, rapid turn-around time and dual-use technology. The initial application of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) on the Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) Architecture 6 Concept has helped to define key assumptions necessary to make the development of the Architecture 6 concept successful. While the final figures of merit (FOMs) will be based on successfully developing and testing the vehicle, preliminary FOMs can be used now for basic trades between propulsion and staging concepts, thus providing a valuable tool to evaluate the overall trade space between highly divergent concepts. Reliability analysis, Probabilistic Design Methods (PDM), and Probabilistic Risk Assessment can be integrated to evaluate overall systems architecture, a complete mission model, and a fleet logistics model. In addition, the PRA may be used to evaluate and compare a high and low energy crew escape system.

DE space debris; orbital breakup event; fragment velocity additions
AB The estimation of velocity changes in an orbital breakup event of any space object is an important activity in the field of space debris. There are various methods described in the literature to estimate velocity additions. In one method, the normal, radial and tangential components of fragment velocity additions are estimated from the differences in semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination with respect to those of parent object. Unfortunately, when the parent orbit has small eccentricity or the breakup occurs either near apogee or near perigee, the computation of radial component of velocity increment encounters a singularity and hence is prone to errors because of imperfect orbital element data. In another method, velocity increments are estimated from semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascension of the ascending node and true anomaly of fragments as well as parent at the time of breakup. It is very difficult to obtain the true anomaly of the fragments at the time of breakup by propagating the element sets of debris pieces backward in time owing to uncertainties in orbital elements and drag parameters. Moreover, whenever the apogee of the fragment orbit becomes less than the perigee of the parent orbit due to various perturbations or errors, this method does not yield any solution for the radial component of the velocity increment. In this paper, first, a linear method is described to estimate the components of velocity addition, utilizing relations involving the differences in semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and argument of perigee in a particular combination and sequence, which avoids the singularity in the computation. Later, a fully nonlinear method to obtain velocity additions without any assumption is presented, which is found to be superior to any of the methods described in the literature so far.

ID FREE-FLIGHT
AB We present a large-scale, airspace planning and collaborative decision-making model (APCDM) to enhance the management of the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). Given a set of flights that must be scheduled during some planning horizon, along with alternative surrogate trajectories for each flight as prompted by various airspace restriction scenarios imposed by dynamic severe weather systems or space launch special use airspaces (SUA), we develop a mixed-integer programming model to select a set of flight plans from among these alternatives, subject to flight safety, air traffic control workload, and airline equity constraints. The model includes a three-dimensional probabilistic conflict analysis, the derivation of valid inequalities, the development of air traffic control workload metrics, and the consideration of equity among airline carriers in absorbing costs related to rerouting, delays, and possible cancellations. The resulting APCDM model has potential use for both tactical and strategic applications, such as air traffic control in response to severe weather phenomena or spacecraft launches, FAA policy evaluation (separation standards, workload restrictions, sectorization. strategies), Homeland Defense contingency planning, and military air campaign planning. The model can also serve a useful role in augmenting the FANS National Playbook of standardized flight profiles in different disruption-prone regions of the national airspace. The present paper focuses on the theory and model development; Part II of this paper will address model parameter estimations and implementation test results.

ID ANGULAR-RATE ESTIMATION
AB Methods are developed for estimating the rotation rate of a spacecraft using only measured magnetic field data. The goal is to provide rate information for use in applications such as detumbling, nutation damping, and momentum management without using gyroscopes. Two algorithms are developed, a deterministic algorithm and an extended Kalman filter. Both algorithms employ the magnetic field direction kinematics equation and Euler's equation for attitude motion of a rigid body with momentum wheels. Neither algorithm requires a model of the Earth's magnetic field. The deterministic algorithm solves a nonlinear least-squares problem for the unknown angular momentum component along the magnetic field direction. The extended Kalman filter estimates the attitude rate vector, corrections to five of the six inertia matrix elements, and two error states of the measured magnetic field direction. It uses an initial rate estimate from the deterministic algorithm to avoid divergence. The algorithms have been tested using data from a spinning sounding rocket. They achieve initial accuracies in the range 2-7 deg/s when the rocket spins at about 80 deg/s, and their accuracies improve to 1-2 deg/s after the spin rate decays to 20 deg/s. These results indicate a lower bound on the ratio of the error to the nominal spin rate, which suggests that dynamic modeling error is the dominant source of uncertainty.

ID ENVIRONMENT; STREAMS
AB The 1997 MASTER model (ESA's meteoroid and space debris terrestrial reference) considers man made objects due to historical launches and fragmentation debris larger than 100 mum. This paper addresses the improvements of the MASTER model by consideration of also non-fragmentation debris down to 1 mum in diameter. For this purpose, debris generated by solid rocket motor firings, surface degradation particles, impact ejecta, and NaK droplets released by nuclear reactors in space are currently being implemented in the model. All debris sources are considered from LEO up to the geosynchronous region. The new MASTER debris population is analysed in terms of the spatial distribution and resulting object flux, and it is compared with measurement data. Although the number of man-made objects represented in the model has been increased significantly, it is shown that the required resources to run the model are acceptable in terms of computer time and storage. The new model architecture, especially the parametric source term description, enables effective maintenance and model upgrade in response to ongoing debris measurements and source model improvements. The user branch of the MASTER model now provides a graphical interface for all platforms supported. (C) 2002 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE space debris; impact risk; Opik's theory
ID COLLISION
AB Opik's analytical expressions relate in a simple way the semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination of the projectile orbit to the magnitude and direction of the relative velocity vector at impact on a given target on circular orbit. These interesting quantities, along with the impact probability of any given projectile, can be all represented on a suitable projection giving a comprehensive picture of the impact risk on the selected target. By means of this theory a complete analysis of the impact risk on the International Space Station (ISS) is performed. It is found that the large majority of the debris population is on orbits such that a correlation exists between their impact velocity on the ISS and the angle between the velocity vector of the impactor and that of the ISS. The impactor population also is separated in terms of nature of the projectiles, with most of the low-medium velocity ones being particles related to solid rocket motor slag condensates. On the other hand, the highest velocity projectiles are composed mainly by fragments of past in-orbit explosions.
   The flux of projectiles on the ISS has been calculated for the planned operative lifetime of the Station, by assuming a realistic scenario of the future debris environment evolution and the actual planned altitude profile for the ISS mission. There is a factor 2-3 variation of the flux due to the changing ISS altitude. The most dangerous part of the mission appears to be the central one, when the ISS will orbit at about 450 km above the Earth.

ID HYDROSTATIC BEARINGS
AB Test results are presented for the rotordynamic coefficients of a hybrid bearing that is representative of bearings for liquid-rocket-engine turbopump applications. The bearing is tested in the following two degraded conditions: (a) one of five orifices plugged, and (b) a locally enlarged clearance to simulate a worn condition. Test data are presented at 24,600 rpm, with supply pressures of 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0 MPa, and eccentricity ratios from 0.1 to 0.5 in 0.1 increments. Overall, the results suggest that neither a single plugged orifice nor significant wear on the bearing land will "disable" a well-designed hybrid bearing. These results do not speak to multiple plugged orifices and are not an endorsement for operations without filters to prevent plugging orifices.

DE floating ring seal; leakage; rotordynamic coefficients; eccentricity
   ratio; turbo pump
AB The floating ring seal is often used in an oxidizer and a fuel pump of the turbo pump unit in the liquid rocket engine because the floating ring seal has the ability to minimize clearance without rubbing phenomenon, For the analysis of performance and vibration characteristics of the turbo pump unit with floating ring seals, the exact prediction of the lock-up position of the floating ring is essential to evaluate the leakage and rotordynamic coefficients from the floating ring seal. The governing equations, which are based on the 'bulk-flow model', are derived from extending the eccentric annular plain seal analysis. The solution procedure is developed by using the Fast Fourier Transform Method of Nelson and Nguyen. The results of lock-up position, attitude angle of the floating ring, leakage flow rate, and rotordynamic coefficients are presented with operating conditions and geometric parameters of the floating ring seal for an example case.

AB A 100 m long, disused urban storm tank built in the 1920s is now serving as the foundation for the UK's exciting new National Space Centre on the banks of the River Soar in Leicester. The Millennium Commission funded project has set a new benchmark for urban regeneration, not only for its skillful reuse of redundant infrastructure but also for its innovative approaches to structural design, internal climate control and contamination management. It features a 40 m high 'bubble-wrapped' rocket tower, a complex combination of naturally vented and air-conditioned internal spaces and a large, unden-vented car-parking area to cover the most contaminated parts of the site.

AB Mission success depends on proper integration of safety, risk management, and assurance processes throughout the project life-cycle. In the current government acquisition environment great emphasis is being placed on innovative contracting approaches that involve cooperative agreements, performance-based contracting, and contractor use of best practices. Thus, far fewer prescribed standards and specifications are involved in government acquisition today as compared to the early 1990's. Additionally, the shift from rule-based assurance management to knowledge-based approaches poses a separate set of challenges as clearly underscored in government and industry accident assessments and mishap investigations that followed a costly streak of launch vehicle and spacecraft failures in the late 1990 time frame. In response to these challenges the NASA Off-ice of Safety & Mission Assurance began development of the Process Based Mission Assurance Knowledge Management System (PBMA-K-MS) in mid 1999. The PBMA-KMS is a user-friendly, web-based system designed to support life-cycle safety and mission success management, This paper describes the PBMA-KMS functionality, operation, and plans for future growth. Aerospace professionals are encouraged to use the PBMA-KMS by participating in discipline oriented work groups, and contributing best practices, lessons teamed, and ideas for future functional enhancements.

ID LOW-EARTH-ORBIT; IMPACTS
AB Prior to the retrieval in 1993 from low Earth orbit (LEO), the " -V2" Solar Array wing of the Hubble Space Telescope was exposed to hypervelocity impacts (micrometre to millimetre scale) from both micrometeoroids and space debris. The initial survey of the damage (100-3500mum diameter sized craters) identified that micrometeoroid remnants dominated the flux in the 100-1000mum size regime, with debris dominating >1000mum. These residues were composed of remnants of silicate minerals, calcite, metal sulfides and metals that often appeared as complex poly-mineralic melts within melt pits. A further survey of 10-100mum diameter craters identified that the most common chemistry was space debris with the crossover from meteoroids to debris being at around 30mum D-CO. Residues include remnants of specialised steels and paint fragments but the dominant type is aluminium and aluminium oxide, which are almost certainly remnants of solid rocket motor operations. It is found that the relative contribution of debris as a function of size, agrees remarkably with a prediction derived using flux data from Long Duration Exposure Facility and a meteoroid model.

TI Magnetohydrodynamics energy bypass scramjet performance with real gas
   effects
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The theoretical performance of a scramjet propulsion system incorporating a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy bypass scheme is calculated. The one-dimensional analysis developed earlier, in which the theoretical performance is calculated neglecting skin friction and using a sudden-freezing approximation for the nozzle flow, is modified to incorporate the method of Van Driest for turbulent skin friction and a finite-rate chemistry calculation in the nozzle. Unlike in the earlier design, in which four ramp compressions occurred in the pitch plane, in the present design the first two ramp compressions occur in the pitch plane, and the next two compressions occur in the yaw plane. The results for the simplified design of a spaceliner show that 1) skin friction substantially reduces thrust and specific impulse and 2) the specific impulse of the MHD-bypass system is still better than the non-MHD system and typical rocket over a range of flight speeds and design parameters. Results suggest that the energy management with MHD principles offers the possibility of improving the performance of the scramjet for the spaceliner application and for the globecruiser application. The technical issues needing further studies are identified.

AB Background: A low serum level (< 100 mg/L) of the actin-scavenger Gc-globulin is a prognostic marker of non-survival in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). It is unknown whether decreased production or increased consumption (or both) is responsible for the low Gc-globulin levels. Methods: Ten patients with FHF and four patients with acute or chronic liver disease (AOCLD) with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grades II-IV were included. Eight patients with cirrhosis (chronic liver disease. CLD) without HE served as controls. Total, free, and actin-bound Gc-globulin were measured in samples from an artery, a central vein, and a hepatic vein. In 12 patients (9 FHF, 3 AOCLD), concentrations were measured before and after high volume plasmapheresis (HVP). Results: Total Gc-globulin was reduced to 21%, 40%, and 43% of the normal level in the FHF, AOCLD, and CLD groups, respectively, whereas bound Gc-globulin was within normal range in all patients. The Gc:actin complex ratio was increased 3.8. 2.5, and 1.9-fold compared with normal levels. Total, free, and bound serum Gc-globulin levels did not differ among arterial, systemic venous, or hepatic venous blood. Total Ge-globulin rose to >100 mg/L in all patients after HVP, whereas bound Gc-globulin remained unchanged. The Gc-globulin production rate in FHF and AOCLD patients was increased to 4.1 +/- 1.3 mg/min compared to literature values of 0.6 mg/min in healthy individuals. The estimated half-life of total Gc-globulin was shorter in the patients compared to healthy individuals (127 +/- 56 min and 870 min, respectively). Conclusions: Gc-globulin levels were reduced in patients with FHF and AOCLD because a 7-fold increase of Gc-globulin production rate could not compensate for the accelerated clearance. Bound Gc-globulin was maintained within normal levels in all circumstances studied, indicating a possible regulatory role of this parameter in the clearance of actin.

TI Tethers and debris mitigation
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

CY OCT 02-06, 2000
CL RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL
AB In recent years, the use of tethers has been proposed for reduction of space debris either through momentum transfer or use of electrodynamic effects. Tethers have been shown to at least theoretically allow for quick, elegant and cost-effective deorbit of defunct satellites or spent stages. On the other hand, the large risk that tethers themselves may pose to other satellites in orbit has been recognized as well. The large collision area of tethers, combined with operational hazards and meteoroid risk may result in a large orbital exposure. For example, in 1997, the ESA/Dutch 35-km tether deployment of YES from TEAMSAT was inhibited after an analysis of the collision risk for the case the tether operation would fail. The question rises how these two points of view compare to eachother. This paper intends to highlight a representative selection of the proposed tether applications while taking into account the added risks caused by the tethers themselves.
   Typical applications from recent literature will be briefly described, such as an Ariane 502 spent stage re-entry from GTO and the concept of deboost of defunct satellites by interaction of a conductive tether with the Earth magnetic field.
   Mass savings of the tethered systems versus conventional equivalents will be evaluated.
   Based on a crude risk analysis, involving elements such as mission complexity, dynamic stability, meteoroid risk and orbital life time, a general outline of limiting factors can be given for the various applications. Special attention is reserved for implementation of mechanisms that help reduce this tether risk, such as the DUtether (Tether Degradable by Ultraviolet), utilization of airdrag and solar pressure, the effect of residual current in bare tethers, tether retrieval etc.
   It is proposed how a net tether-induced mitigation can be compared to that of conventional alternatives, i.e. deboost by rocket engine or a completely passive approach.
   This comparison is put in the perspective of an ever-increasing occupation of the space environment.
   It is concluded that tethers can in fact help mitigate the debris risk and that for each application a useful niche can be defined. It is argued that eliminating pollution directly after use of the precious resource of space is not only good custom, but also an important way to make the risk of debris controllable and independent of future trends. Although tethers may have large exposure in terms of area-time product, they deliver a quick cleaning service that may be appreciated by the future users of space. (C) 2001 Delta-Utec SRC.

AB The Cosmic Dust/Space Debris impact detector GORID has now collected data for more than 3 years from its geostationary location at 80degrees East. The aperture size is 0.1 m(2) and the instrument is capable of detecting particles with a mass down to about 10-14 g (velocity dependent). The registered number of likely impact events per day ranged from 0 to more than 40 with an average around 2 per day. Many impacts occurred clustered in time and these clustered events sometimes reappeared for one or more days. It is suggested that these clustered events result from impacts of clouds of exhaust particles from the firing of solid rocket motors (SRM). For the specific case of an insertion burn into geostationary orbit on 10th June 1998 a detailed simulation of the SRM cloud evolution and expected impacts on GORED is performed. The results of this analysis are consistent with GORED measurements 11 days after the thruster firing. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of individual solar cells removed from the returned array from the Hubble Space Telescope have yielded results on the residue chemistry of material preserved in impact features within the 1-3500mum. size range. The initial survey of impact craters in the 100-3500mum size range identified that micrometeoroids were the dominant precursor chemistry. The second survey of impact features between 1-100 mum identified space debris as the prevailing precursor chemistry. The categories of space debris remnants observed in this size range were dominated by aluminium and aluminium oxide chemistries indicative of solid rocket motor fuel debris. The results from the residue chemistry surveys have now been compared with a prediction derived from LDEF data and meteoroid modelling, and there is general agreement between the modelling and actual observations.

AB MASTER-99 is a space debris and meteoroid environment model produced by TU Braunschweig (D), eta_max space (D), and DERA (U-K) under an ESA contract. The model allows to compute particulate impact fluxes on any terrestrial target orbit up to geostationary altitudes. Flux contributions can be discriminated with respect to debris source types (catalog objects, explosion and collision fragments, NaK droplets, solid rocket motor dust and slag, impact ejecta, and surface degradation products), meteoroid source types (Divine-Staubach populations, and annual stream events), and with respect to origin and impact direction of each flux contributing particulate. Impact fluxes of meteoroids and debris down to 1 gm sizes can be determined for spherical targets, for tumbling plates, or for oriented, planar surfaces which are controlled according to standard attitude steering laws. MASTER-99 is distributed by ESA/ESOC on a CD ROM which includes user documentation, and the necessary data files, executables, and GUI driven installation scripts for the most common operating systems and computer platforms. MASTER-99 is delivered together with PROOF-99, a program for radar and optical observation forecasting. Based on the MASTER-99 population larger than 1 mm, it predicts debris detections from ground-based or space-based sensors (radars or telescopes) of user-defined system performances. (C) 2001 COSPAR.

TI Additional historical solid rocket motor burns
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of orbital solid rocket motors (SRM) is responsible for the release of a high number of slag and Al(2)O(3) dust particles which contribute to the space debris environment. This contribution has been modeled for the ESA space debris model MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference). The current model version, MASTER-2005, is based on the simulation of 1076 orbital SRM firings which mainly contributed to the long-term debris environment. SRM firings on very low earth orbits which produce only short living particles are not considered. A comparison of the modeled flux with impact data from returned surfaces shows that the shape and quantity of the modeled SRM dust distribution matches that of recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array measurements very well. However, the absolute flux level for dust is under-predicted for some of the analyzed Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) surfaces. This indicates that some past SRM firings are not included in the current event database. Thus it is necessary to investigate, if additional historical SRM burns, like the retro-bum of low orbiting re-entry capsules, may be responsible for these dust impacts. The most suitable candidates for these firings are the large number of SRM retro-bums of return capsules. This paper focuses on the SRM retro-bums of Russian photoreconnaissance satellites, which were used in high numbers during the time of the LDEF mission. It is discussed which types of satellites and motors may have been responsible for this historical contribution. Altogether, 870 additional SRM retro-bums have been identified. An important task is the identification of such missions to complete the current event data base. Different types of motors have been used to de-orbit both large satellites and small film return capsules. The results of simulation runs are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last twenty years, the level of international research collaboration on military energetic materials has increased significantly and has been reported in the literature. It is time to look at what has been done and to critically examine that benefits that it has produced. The range of programmes has covered the whole range of energetic materials and in addition to the study of ne,x materials and new forms of materials, it has covered modelling as well as standards and protocols. Programmes have ranged from pressed explosives to rocket propellants and from IM technology to environmental and life management. It can be argued that these programmes have provided the participating nations with materials as well as the understanding to better manage their behaviour and use. Without this range of activity significantly less Would have been achieved. This will be discussed in the light of a selection of published papers and reports.

AB Retailing is a huge industry. In the United States, retail business represents about 40% of the economy and is the largest employer. Retail supply chain management is still more art than science, but this is changing rapidly as retailers begin to apply analytic models to the huge volume of data they are collecting on consumer purchases and preferences. This industry-wide movement resembles the transformation of Wall Street that occurred in the 1970s when physicists and other "rocket scientists" applied their analytic skills to investment decisions.
   The Consortium for Operational Excellence in Retailing (COER) (codirected by Ananth Raman, Harvard Business School, and myself) is a group of academics working with about 50 leading retailers to assess their progress towards rocket science retailing and to accelerate that progress through selected research projects.
   After some brief comments on the current state of industry practice in retail supply chain management, this paper will describe examples of COER research in four areas: assortment planning, pricing, inventory optimization, and store execution.

TI A study of the material density distribution of space debris
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Orbital debris; Debris; Composition; Materials; Breakup; Modeling
AB Material density is ail important, yet often overlooked, property of orbital debris particles. Many models simply use a typical density to represent all breakup fragments. While adequate for modeling average characteristics in some applications, a single value material density may not be sufficient for reliable impact damage assessments. In an attempt to improve the next-generation NASA Orbital Debris Engineering Model, a study oil the material density distribution of the breakup fragments has been conducted and summarized in this paper.
   The material density distribution of the on-orbit breakup debris population may be estimated by combining three sources of data: available pre-launch information on satellite materials, ground-based satellite breakup experiments, and chemical compositions of residuals collected from returned surfaces. Analysis of these data provides a basis to compile a simple mass density distribution. For example, about 75% of on-orbit breakup debris fragments come from upper stages, which are simpler and more standardized than payloads in construction and composition. Available material information from manufacturers can be used to develop a reasonable distribution function for this component. For spacecraft breakup debris, it has been found that the range of material densities may be simplified into three representative Values: high (e.g. steel), medium (e.g. aluminum), and low (,e.g. plastic). The current study develops preliminary distributions for breakup debris: rocket body debris is 90% medium-density and 10% high-density (by number); payload debris is 70% low-density, 27% medium, and 3% high-density. Although the three data sources mentioned above are not comprehensive, and some interpretation and extrapolation arc needed. the resulting density distributions still represent a step forward in providing more reliable damage assessments for future debris models. Future work will refine the data and provide distributions as functions of particle size and orbital altitude. (C) 2008 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DEBRIS REMOVAL SYSTEM; SATELLITE; SURVIVABILITY; MODEL
AB By using electrodynamic drag to greatly increase the orbital decay rate, an electrodynamic space tether can remove spent or dysfunctional spacecraft from low Earth orbit (LEO) rapidly and safely, Moreover, the low mass requirements of such tether devices make them highly advantageous compared to conventional rocket-based de-orbit systems. However, a tether system is much more vulnerable to space debris impacts than a typical spacecraft and its design must be proved to be safe up to a certain confidence level before being adopted for potential applications. To assess space debris related concerns, in March 2001 a new task (Action Item 19.1) on the "Potential Benefits and Risks of Using Electrodynamic Tethers for End-of-life De-orbit of LEO Spacecraft" was defined by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). Two tests were proposed to compute the fatal impact rite of meteoroids and orbital debris on space tethers in circular orbits, at different altitudes and inclinations, as it function of the tether diameter to assess the survival probability of an electrodynamic tether system during typical de-orbiting missions. IADC members from three agencies, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), participated in the study and different computational approaches were specifically developed within the framework of the IADC task. This paper summarizes the content of the IADC AI 19.1 Final Report. In particular, it introduces the potential benefits and risks of using tethers in space, it describes the assumptions Made in the study plan, it compares and discusses the results obtained by ASI, JAXA and NASA for the two tests proposed, Some general conclusions and recommendations are finally extrapolated from this massive and intensive piece of research.
